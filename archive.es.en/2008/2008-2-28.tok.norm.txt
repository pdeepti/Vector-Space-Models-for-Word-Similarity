basic rights are n't disposable , says dw 's daphne antachopoulos . the court decision follows the same guideline as many other verdicts from the constitutional court in karlsruhe : security laws may not undermine basic rights . the judges reached a similar conclusion in deciding whether to allow authorities to bug private apartments or shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked by terrorists .
human and civil rights take precedence over the nearly insatiable need for security cultivated by some politicians . the now invalid law in north rhine-westphalia had allowed authorities to access a suspect 's hard drive and keep it under regular surveillance - under the condition that they expected to find evidence of anti-constitutional activity . such a massive intrusion should not be possible on such vague grounds , the karlsruhe court decided .
rather , the state may secretly spy on someone only if there is strong evidence that personal safety , lives , freedom , state property or the foundation of human existence are endangered .
and only with permission from a judge . those are high hurdles .
and that 's how they should be . it was n't a coincidence that court president hans-juergen papier said the decision had implications beyond the case in north rhine-westphalia .
his words were directed at interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who is planning a federal law allowing for online surveillance of crime suspects . schaeuble 's credo is that the threat of terrorism is omnipresent , invisible and incalculable .
therefore , the state should take such measures in order to prevent this danger .
according to schaeuble , all surveillance and combat instruments should be able to be used even in fully abstract situations of danger . fortunately , karlsruhe clamped down first .
basic rights are n't disposable regardless of the need for security .
the criteria for state action must be very concretely defined , particularly when a basic right is so massively intruded upon .
innocent people should not be targeted by the state with such sweeping , preventive blows . wednesday 's court decision recalled yet another axiom : not only do we need protection by the state but also from the state . if every citizen is treated like a potential terrorist and his or her private sphere is monitored , the state will have a hard time convincing its citizens that it also wants to protect them . wolfgang schaeuble said he will take the court decision into account .
the question remains why these kinds of issues always have to be resolved in karlsruhe and not first in berlin . it seems as if politicians responsible for security always want to test the boundaries - and the constitutional court is then forced to draw the line . daphne antachopoulos is a reporter for deutsche welle specializing in german domestic and foreign policy . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

basic rights are n't disposable , says dw 's daphne antachopoulos . the court decision follows the same guideline as many other verdicts from the constitutional court in karlsruhe : security laws may not undermine basic rights . the judges reached a similar conclusion in deciding whether to allow authorities to bug private apartments or shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked by terrorists .
human and civil rights take precedence over the nearly insatiable need for security cultivated by some politicians . the now invalid law in north rhine-westphalia had allowed authorities to access a suspect 's hard drive and keep it under regular surveillance - under the condition that they expected to find evidence of anti-constitutional activity . such a massive intrusion should not be possible on such vague grounds , the karlsruhe court decided .
rather , the state may secretly spy on someone only if there is strong evidence that personal safety , lives , freedom , state property or the foundation of human existence are endangered .
and only with permission from a judge . those are high hurdles .
and that 's how they should be . it was n't a coincidence that court president hans-juergen papier said the decision had implications beyond the case in north rhine-westphalia .
his words were directed at interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who is planning a federal law allowing for online surveillance of crime suspects . schaeuble 's credo is that the threat of terrorism is omnipresent , invisible and incalculable .
therefore , the state should take such measures in order to prevent this danger .
according to schaeuble , all surveillance and combat instruments should be able to be used even in fully abstract situations of danger . fortunately , karlsruhe clamped down first .

the german government 's crackdown on tax evaders comes courtesy of stolen bank data , for which germany 's intelligence service , the bnd , paid millions .
but now many have begun to ask : does the end justify the means ? investigators probing the scale of tax evasion by germans have already uncovered some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in funds stashed in trusts in liechtenstein - and that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
by the time investigators have finished , the 4.2 million euros paid to an informant alleged to have stolen client data from liechtenstein 's lgt bank in 2002 will look like a bargain-basement price in comparison with the vast sums reclaimed by the german finance ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the data bought by the bnd was reportedly stolen from the lgt group in 2002 despite this , the whole affair is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many ordinary germans as well as politicians who take issue with the methods used by the government to obtain the liechtenstein bank data .
a poll showed that 52 percent of voters think the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- should not have paid for the information , while just 41 percent think the payment was justified .
" ordinary germans feel a certain solidarity with the people who are now being investigated for tax evasion , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university .
" on some level , this is something everyone in germany tries to do , whether that involves writing off bigger sums in your tax declaration than you should , getting paid for work that you do n't declare or paying someone to work under the table for you , " he added .
" these people also do n't want to be caught , and so they have something against the government using such methods to pursue tax evaders . "
a great deal or a criminal act ?
the bnd normally has nothing to do with tax matters , but officials say it was offered the information and only acted on it after consulting the government and tax authorities .
a notarized contract for the sum paid to the informant was drawn up , and detailed records were kept every step of the way .
according to finance ministry officials , there 's no doubt that the data will be admissible in court .
finance minister peer steinbrück said he did n't want to imagine the " wave of indignation that would roll through the country " if the bnd had acted any differently .
but ferdinand von schirach , one of two lawyers who have said so far that they plan to sue the german state for its handling of the affair , said the government can not use taxpayers ' money to reward criminal acts - such as the stealing of confidential bank information .
" even though it seems like a great deal … a crime can not be committed , " he told reuters tv .
" if that was the case , the state would be no better than any criminal on the street . "

he said the informant , who has been identified as former lgt bank employee heinrich kieber , had been convicted of stealing bank data in 2002 and imprisoned .
" obviously , germany wants to be a big-time receiver of stolen goods , " he said , also making thinly veiled references to germany 's past aggression in europe .
" we are also a sovereign state and - we hope - do not live in an era where might makes right . "
contributing to the war of words that 's been started with the tiny alpine state , german chancellor angela merkel accused liechtenstein 's banks of " encouraging lawbreaking , " and said that it and other tax havens should " mend their ways " or face the consequences .
swiss banks suspicious of espionage one of the consequences already emerging from the bnd 's liechtenstein operation is that germans applying for jobs at swiss banks will undergo additional scrutiny in future because of espionage concerns .

the head of switzerland 's private banker 's association , michel derobert , said the methods used by the bnd to obtain the secret banking data from liechtenstein were " reprehensible " and would lead to extra precautions in switzerland to protect client privacy .

the german government 's crackdown on tax evaders comes courtesy of stolen bank data , for which germany 's intelligence service , the bnd , paid millions .
but now many have begun to ask : does the end justify the means ? investigators probing the scale of tax evasion by germans have already uncovered some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in funds stashed in trusts in liechtenstein - and that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
by the time investigators have finished , the 4.2 million euros paid to an informant alleged to have stolen client data from liechtenstein 's lgt bank in 2002 will look like a bargain-basement price in comparison with the vast sums reclaimed by the german finance ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the data bought by the bnd was reportedly stolen from the lgt group in 2002 despite this , the whole affair is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many ordinary germans as well as politicians who take issue with the methods used by the government to obtain the liechtenstein bank data .
a poll showed that 52 percent of voters think the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- should not have paid for the information , while just 41 percent think the payment was justified .
" ordinary germans feel a certain solidarity with the people who are now being investigated for tax evasion , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university .
" on some level , this is something everyone in germany tries to do , whether that involves writing off bigger sums in your tax declaration than you should , getting paid for work that you do n't declare or paying someone to work under the table for you , " he added .
" these people also do n't want to be caught , and so they have something against the government using such methods to pursue tax evaders . "
a great deal or a criminal act ?
the bnd normally has nothing to do with tax matters , but officials say it was offered the information and only acted on it after consulting the government and tax authorities .
a notarized contract for the sum paid to the informant was drawn up , and detailed records were kept every step of the way .
according to finance ministry officials , there 's no doubt that the data will be admissible in court .
finance minister peer steinbrück said he did n't want to imagine the " wave of indignation that would roll through the country " if the bnd had acted any differently .
but ferdinand von schirach , one of two lawyers who have said so far that they plan to sue the german state for its handling of the affair , said the government can not use taxpayers ' money to reward criminal acts - such as the stealing of confidential bank information .
" even though it seems like a great deal … a crime can not be committed , " he told reuters tv .
" if that was the case , the state would be no better than any criminal on the street . "
bnd must answer to parliamentary committee last week , the bnd was asked to brief a parliamentary committee on its methods so that the government could decide whether to approve or disapprove of the liechtenstein operation , but members of the parliamentary intelligence committee deemed more documents were needed .
the next briefing is set for march 5 .
speaking to the berlin-based newspaper , taz , following the initial briefing , green party parliamentarian christian ströbele stressed the need for rule of law , even when it comes to hunting down tax evaders .
" putting aside my joy that the right people are finally being targeted , the law has to be followed here , even against our richest citizens , " ströbele said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neskovic : bnd 's behavior is " clearly illegal " left party parliamentarian wolfgang neskovic was more critical .
" the bnd 's behavior is , in my view , clearly illegal , " he said .
but neskovic doubts whether the parliamentary session on march 5 will lead to any consequences for the intelligence agency .
" in this republic , there are unchecked zones , especially when it comes to the intelligence service , and this has to change , " said neskovic , a former federal court justice .
" what we know of up to now is just a drop , and what we do n't know amounts to an ocean . "

in january , a court in the northern state of schleswig-holstein reached a similar conclusion , saying swedish energy company vattenfall could not transfer energy output from muehlheim-kaerlich , where it also has a power plant , to a power plant in brunsbüttel . each nuclear power plant 's remaining operational time is measured in terms of the amount of power it is allowed to generate .
a 2002 law governing germany 's plans to eliminate nuclear power only allows a company to transfer energy output from one plant to another in very specific cases . utilities vs. public opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-nuke activists say it is a greener energy alternative rwe had asked to transfer the allowance to produce 30 terawatt hours of electricity from muehlheim-kaerlich to biblis a. without the transfer the biblis a plant would run until about september 2009 .
had it been approved , the transfer would have kept the biblis a plant open through federal elections in 2009 . rwe said wednesday , feb .
27 , that it planned to appeal the verdict at the federal administrative court . german utilities - including e.on , the world 's largest utility by sales - are battling public opinion and politicians to change an agreement with the government under which they have to shut all their nuclear power plants by the early 2020s . hoping for shift in political winds they want to use their profitable nuclear power stations for several years longer , and hope that a possible change in the country 's political makeup could lead to a reversal of the decision to eliminate nuclear power . utilities argue that nuclear power produces less carbon dioxide , a gas causing global warming , and would help keep power prices down , as fuels such as coal have climbed to record highs . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in january , a court in the northern state of schleswig-holstein reached a similar conclusion , saying swedish energy company vattenfall could not transfer energy output from muehlheim-kaerlich , where it also has a power plant , to a power plant in brunsbüttel . each nuclear power plant 's remaining operational time is measured in terms of the amount of power it is allowed to generate .
a 2002 law governing germany 's plans to eliminate nuclear power only allows a company to transfer energy output from one plant to another in very specific cases . utilities vs. public opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-nuke activists say it is a greener energy alternative rwe had asked to transfer the allowance to produce 30 terawatt hours of electricity from muehlheim-kaerlich to biblis a. without the transfer the biblis a plant would run until about september 2009 .
had it been approved , the transfer would have kept the biblis a plant open through federal elections in 2009 . rwe said wednesday , feb .
27 , that it planned to appeal the verdict at the federal administrative court . german utilities - including e.on , the world 's largest utility by sales - are battling public opinion and politicians to change an agreement with the government under which they have to shut all their nuclear power plants by the early 2020s . hoping for shift in political winds they want to use their profitable nuclear power stations for several years longer , and hope that a possible change in the country 's political makeup could lead to a reversal of the decision to eliminate nuclear power . utilities argue that nuclear power produces less carbon dioxide , a gas causing global warming , and would help keep power prices down , as fuels such as coal have climbed to record highs . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in january , a court in the northern state of schleswig-holstein reached a similar conclusion , saying swedish energy company vattenfall could not transfer energy output from muehlheim-kaerlich , where it also has a power plant , to a power plant in brunsbüttel . each nuclear power plant 's remaining operational time is measured in terms of the amount of power it is allowed to generate .
a 2002 law governing germany 's plans to eliminate nuclear power only allows a company to transfer energy output from one plant to another in very specific cases . utilities vs. public opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-nuke activists say it is a greener energy alternative rwe had asked to transfer the allowance to produce 30 terawatt hours of electricity from muehlheim-kaerlich to biblis a. without the transfer the biblis a plant would run until about september 2009 .
had it been approved , the transfer would have kept the biblis a plant open through federal elections in 2009 . rwe said wednesday , feb .
27 , that it planned to appeal the verdict at the federal administrative court . german utilities - including e.on , the world 's largest utility by sales - are battling public opinion and politicians to change an agreement with the government under which they have to shut all their nuclear power plants by the early 2020s . hoping for shift in political winds they want to use their profitable nuclear power stations for several years longer , and hope that a possible change in the country 's political makeup could lead to a reversal of the decision to eliminate nuclear power . utilities argue that nuclear power produces less carbon dioxide , a gas causing global warming , and would help keep power prices down , as fuels such as coal have climbed to record highs . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the scene spawned a generation of anarcho-punks , making the city a counter-cultural haven .
few know that it also spawned the current chancellor . from one-time revolutionary joschka fischer to former raf defense lawyer otto schily , a rebellious youth seems to be a rite-of-passage for german politicians .
those two went on to become the last german administration 's foreign and interior ministers . until now , however , no one ever suspected that chancellor angela merkel boasts equally street-smart credentials . a woman who looks as though she would n't even risk jaywalking , merkel revealed in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's magazine to be published friday , feb .
28 , that as a veteran of the infamous berlin squat scene , she too once enjoyed a spell on society 's margins . during her 20s , she explained , she lived illegally in an apartment in the district of mitte , a now gentrified neighborhood in the heart of what was once communist east berlin . apparently , she had struggled to find accommodation when she moved to berlin from leipzig with her first husband in 1978 to work in a science institute .
so what 's a girl to do but reach for the nearest crowbar ? radical chic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a far cry from the german chancellery others might have resorted to scanning the classifieds , but communist east germany raised its citizens to get their hands dirty .
it 's hard to imagine her western colleagues , such as prissy family minister ursula von der leyen , taking similar action - let alone gym-lovin ' condoleezza rice or ultra-groomed hillary clinton , who would surely balk at the lack of running water , outside toilets and hungry rodents that are par for the course in the average squat .
but merkel , the first german chancellor to have grown up in the gdr , is made of sterner stuff .
and unlike in the west , squatting in east berlin did n't necessarily entail endless cans of beer , dogs on strings and torn leather jackets . it just meant moving into a vacant apartment .
" the state renting agency was no longer aware of which buildings were empty and which were n't , " she said .
" i took advantage of their confusion out of desperation . "
but while her peers on the other side of the berlin wall saw squatting as a rejection of mainstream society , indulging in free love , experimenting with drugs and never failing to play their music really loud , merkel the pastor 's daughter made sure she paid rent .
" i simply transferred money to the state renting agency , " she said .
" at the time all money was most welcome . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" kenya has grasped the opportunity to resolve its political crisis peacefully and to return to stability , " he said . in order to help the new government to its feet , british prime minister gordon brown said he would sponsor a donor summit to provide aid to kenya . " we 'd be prepared in london to host a donors conference to make sure kenya has the best chance to build upon this power-sharing agreement , to restore tourism -lrb- and -rrb- get the economy moving again , " he told reporters after speaking to annan . ethnic clashes resulted from disputed election bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism in kenya drastically dropped when violence broke out kibaki 's disputed reelection on dec .

" as a nation , there are more issues that unite than divide us , " said kibaki after the signing .
" we 've been reminded that we must do all in our power to safeguard the peace that is the foundation of our national unity .

the scene spawned a generation of anarcho-punks , making the city a counter-cultural haven .
few know that it also spawned the current chancellor . from one-time revolutionary joschka fischer to former raf defense lawyer otto schily , a rebellious youth seems to be a rite-of-passage for german politicians .
those two went on to become the last german administration 's foreign and interior ministers . until now , however , no one ever suspected that chancellor angela merkel boasts equally street-smart credentials . a woman who looks as though she would n't even risk jaywalking , merkel revealed in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's magazine to be published friday , feb .
28 , that as a veteran of the infamous berlin squat scene , she too once enjoyed a spell on society 's margins . during her 20s , she explained , she lived illegally in an apartment in the district of mitte , a now gentrified neighborhood in the heart of what was once communist east berlin . apparently , she had struggled to find accommodation when she moved to berlin from leipzig with her first husband in 1978 to work in a science institute .
so what 's a girl to do but reach for the nearest crowbar ? radical chic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a far cry from the german chancellery others might have resorted to scanning the classifieds , but communist east germany raised its citizens to get their hands dirty .
it 's hard to imagine her western colleagues , such as prissy family minister ursula von der leyen , taking similar action - let alone gym-lovin ' condoleezza rice or ultra-groomed hillary clinton , who would surely balk at the lack of running water , outside toilets and hungry rodents that are par for the course in the average squat .
but merkel , the first german chancellor to have grown up in the gdr , is made of sterner stuff .
and unlike in the west , squatting in east berlin did n't necessarily entail endless cans of beer , dogs on strings and torn leather jackets . it just meant moving into a vacant apartment .
" the state renting agency was no longer aware of which buildings were empty and which were n't , " she said .
" i took advantage of their confusion out of desperation . "
but while her peers on the other side of the berlin wall saw squatting as a rejection of mainstream society , indulging in free love , experimenting with drugs and never failing to play their music really loud , merkel the pastor 's daughter made sure she paid rent .
" i simply transferred money to the state renting agency , " she said .
" at the time all money was most welcome . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in january , a court in the northern state of schleswig-holstein reached a similar conclusion , saying swedish energy company vattenfall could not transfer energy output from muehlheim-kaerlich , where it also has a power plant , to a power plant in brunsbüttel . each nuclear power plant 's remaining operational time is measured in terms of the amount of power it is allowed to generate .
a 2002 law governing germany 's plans to eliminate nuclear power only allows a company to transfer energy output from one plant to another in very specific cases . utilities vs. public opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-nuke activists say it is a greener energy alternative rwe had asked to transfer the allowance to produce 30 terawatt hours of electricity from muehlheim-kaerlich to biblis a. without the transfer the biblis a plant would run until about september 2009 .
had it been approved , the transfer would have kept the biblis a plant open through federal elections in 2009 . rwe said wednesday , feb .
27 , that it planned to appeal the verdict at the federal administrative court . german utilities - including e.on , the world 's largest utility by sales - are battling public opinion and politicians to change an agreement with the government under which they have to shut all their nuclear power plants by the early 2020s . hoping for shift in political winds they want to use their profitable nuclear power stations for several years longer , and hope that a possible change in the country 's political makeup could lead to a reversal of the decision to eliminate nuclear power . utilities argue that nuclear power produces less carbon dioxide , a gas causing global warming , and would help keep power prices down , as fuels such as coal have climbed to record highs . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in january , a court in the northern state of schleswig-holstein reached a similar conclusion , saying swedish energy company vattenfall could not transfer energy output from muehlheim-kaerlich , where it also has a power plant , to a power plant in brunsbüttel . each nuclear power plant 's remaining operational time is measured in terms of the amount of power it is allowed to generate .
a 2002 law governing germany 's plans to eliminate nuclear power only allows a company to transfer energy output from one plant to another in very specific cases . utilities vs. public opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-nuke activists say it is a greener energy alternative rwe had asked to transfer the allowance to produce 30 terawatt hours of electricity from muehlheim-kaerlich to biblis a. without the transfer the biblis a plant would run until about september 2009 .
had it been approved , the transfer would have kept the biblis a plant open through federal elections in 2009 . rwe said wednesday , feb .
27 , that it planned to appeal the verdict at the federal administrative court . german utilities - including e.on , the world 's largest utility by sales - are battling public opinion and politicians to change an agreement with the government under which they have to shut all their nuclear power plants by the early 2020s . hoping for shift in political winds they want to use their profitable nuclear power stations for several years longer , and hope that a possible change in the country 's political makeup could lead to a reversal of the decision to eliminate nuclear power . utilities argue that nuclear power produces less carbon dioxide , a gas causing global warming , and would help keep power prices down , as fuels such as coal have climbed to record highs . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

basic rights are n't disposable , says dw 's daphne antachopoulos . the court decision follows the same guideline as many other verdicts from the constitutional court in karlsruhe : security laws may not undermine basic rights . the judges reached a similar conclusion in deciding whether to allow authorities to bug private apartments or shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked by terrorists .
human and civil rights take precedence over the nearly insatiable need for security cultivated by some politicians . the now invalid law in north rhine-westphalia had allowed authorities to access a suspect 's hard drive and keep it under regular surveillance - under the condition that they expected to find evidence of anti-constitutional activity . such a massive intrusion should not be possible on such vague grounds , the karlsruhe court decided .
rather , the state may secretly spy on someone only if there is strong evidence that personal safety , lives , freedom , state property or the foundation of human existence are endangered .
and only with permission from a judge . those are high hurdles .
and that 's how they should be . it was n't a coincidence that court president hans-juergen papier said the decision had implications beyond the case in north rhine-westphalia .
his words were directed at interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who is planning a federal law allowing for online surveillance of crime suspects . schaeuble 's credo is that the threat of terrorism is omnipresent , invisible and incalculable .
therefore , the state should take such measures in order to prevent this danger .
according to schaeuble , all surveillance and combat instruments should be able to be used even in fully abstract situations of danger . fortunately , karlsruhe clamped down first .
basic rights are n't disposable regardless of the need for security .
the criteria for state action must be very concretely defined , particularly when a basic right is so massively intruded upon .
innocent people should not be targeted by the state with such sweeping , preventive blows . wednesday 's court decision recalled yet another axiom : not only do we need protection by the state but also from the state . if every citizen is treated like a potential terrorist and his or her private sphere is monitored , the state will have a hard time convincing its citizens that it also wants to protect them . wolfgang schaeuble said he will take the court decision into account .
the question remains why these kinds of issues always have to be resolved in karlsruhe and not first in berlin . it seems as if politicians responsible for security always want to test the boundaries - and the constitutional court is then forced to draw the line . daphne antachopoulos is a reporter for deutsche welle specializing in german domestic and foreign policy . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some government officials and renewable energy experts say he 's needlessly spreading panic . power outages are a common occurrence not just in developing countries .
in the united states , for example , florida residents are still dealing with the chaos resulting from a wide-ranging blackout that affected nearly a million households .
in germany , though , people expect that when they flip a switch or plug in an appliance , power will be in ready supply . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the chaos that hit florida headed across the atlantic ?
this notion was put in doubt on thursday , feb .
28 , when juergen grossmann , the head of german power giant rwe , warned that germany and the rest of europe could experience power outages lasting several days this summer due to a lack of power stations . " power is growing short all over europe because there are not enough power stations , " grossmann told the bild newspaper .
" right now , all we need is the combination of a hot , dry summer and the shutdown of more power stations for maintenance for power security to be endangered . " no energy gap , government says his comments were repudiated on friday by government officials and representatives of some parts of the energy sector . environment ministry spokesman michael schroeren said it would be mistaken for germans to believe that the lights would go out and people would be unable to operate their washing machines due to a lack of power this summer . " all the figures show that there is no reason to speak of an energy gap , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one expert said there 's no reason for germans to stock up on candles schroeren added that while it is true that energy production can be restricted during periods of very hot weather , german citizens generally do not feel the effects . the federal association for hydropower and energy -lrb- bdew -rrb- said that " potential shortages could be the result if many negative factors were to come together at once . " germany 's renewable energy branch reacted with scorn to grossmann 's comments .
the head of the federal association for renewable energy -lrb- bee -rrb- , milan nitzschke , said there are no energy gaps in germany . " this is pure fear-mongering , " he added . competing interests in german " energy mix " there has been ongoing debate in germany about the country 's optimal " energy mix . " germany has committed to a total phase-out of nuclear power by 2020 and to increasing the proportion of energy that comes from renewable sources .
chancellor angela merkel , however , has spoken out for an energy mix that includes nuclear power , as well as more energy generated by coal-fired power stations . merkel 's government plans to build up to 25 new coal-fired plants in order to fill the gap left when nuclear plants are taken offline .
the plans have met with enormous resistance from environmental groups and citizens ' initiatives who see the plans as a backwards step for a country that is meant to be assuming a leading role worldwide in the promotion of clean energy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not the first in the area , the sale suggests the district has failed to become the thriving commercial center the city intended . sony said thursday , feb .
28 , that as part of its streamlining efforts , it would be selling the berlin sony center to a group of german and us investment funds , including investment bank morgan stanley , corpus sireo and an affiliate of the john buck company . the sprawling entertainment complex in the center of the german capital houses offices , stores , restaurants and a cinema and attracts over 8 million visitors a year .
but the company now says it plans to focus on core business areas such as electronics . the sony companies located on the premises will remain tenants , and the center will keep the group 's name , it said in a statement .
the sale is expected to be completed by the end of next month subject to regulatory approval . financial loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what does the future hold for potsdamer platz ?
the move is not entirely unexpected .
in 2006 , the iconic japanese company 's first foreign head , howard stringer , announced 10,000 job cuts and plans for a swathe of asset disposals in an effort to revive its flagging fortunes . the company did not divulge the value of the deal but said the expected profits had already been factored into its earlier forecast for a 471 percent surge in operating profit to 410 billion yen -lrb- $ 3.8 billion , 2.5 billion euros -rrb- in the current fiscal year to march . insiders say sony will be paid less than 600 million euros for the building that originally cost the japanese company 750 million euros in the late 1990s . a failed vision for the capital one of the most ambitious development projects in post-reunification germany , the spectacular domed building designed by architect helmut jahn first opened in june 2000 . it was hailed as a symbol of the new , reunited berlin .
but along with other real estate on potsdamer platz - such as the 19 buildings making up the daimler " quartier , " which sold to the swedish banking group seb last december for an estimated 1.2 billion euros - it failed to help turn the neighborhood into the capital 's new commercial district . to many , the sale will confirm suspicions of waning confidence in the potsdamer platz project - especially given that sony was allegedly unable to find a buyer willing to pay its initial asking price of 800 million euros . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not the first in the area , the sale suggests the district has failed to become the thriving commercial center the city intended . sony said thursday , feb .
28 , that as part of its streamlining efforts , it would be selling the berlin sony center to a group of german and us investment funds , including investment bank morgan stanley , corpus sireo and an affiliate of the john buck company . the sprawling entertainment complex in the center of the german capital houses offices , stores , restaurants and a cinema and attracts over 8 million visitors a year .
but the company now says it plans to focus on core business areas such as electronics . the sony companies located on the premises will remain tenants , and the center will keep the group 's name , it said in a statement .
the sale is expected to be completed by the end of next month subject to regulatory approval . financial loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what does the future hold for potsdamer platz ?
the move is not entirely unexpected .
in 2006 , the iconic japanese company 's first foreign head , howard stringer , announced 10,000 job cuts and plans for a swathe of asset disposals in an effort to revive its flagging fortunes . the company did not divulge the value of the deal but said the expected profits had already been factored into its earlier forecast for a 471 percent surge in operating profit to 410 billion yen -lrb- $ 3.8 billion , 2.5 billion euros -rrb- in the current fiscal year to march . insiders say sony will be paid less than 600 million euros for the building that originally cost the japanese company 750 million euros in the late 1990s . a failed vision for the capital one of the most ambitious development projects in post-reunification germany , the spectacular domed building designed by architect helmut jahn first opened in june 2000 . it was hailed as a symbol of the new , reunited berlin .
but along with other real estate on potsdamer platz - such as the 19 buildings making up the daimler " quartier , " which sold to the swedish banking group seb last december for an estimated 1.2 billion euros - it failed to help turn the neighborhood into the capital 's new commercial district . to many , the sale will confirm suspicions of waning confidence in the potsdamer platz project - especially given that sony was allegedly unable to find a buyer willing to pay its initial asking price of 800 million euros . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" eon proposes to commit to sell its electricity transmission system network to an operator which would have no interest in the electricity generation and / or supply business , " the european commission said in a statement . move could end antitrust inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels will now check whether it antitrust proceedings against eon can be dropped eu economics ministers were meeting in brussels on thursday to discuss ways of increasing competition in the gas and power sector .
eu energy commissioner andris pielbalgs welcomed eon 's decision , adding that he hoped other companies would act in a similar fashion . wulf bernotat , chief executive of eon , had discussed the possible sale with german chancellor angela merkel , a government spokesperson said .
still , the news is likely to have come as a surprise , as the german government had made a point of lobbying in brussels for the company to avoid such a sell-off . the company has also promised to divest 4,800 megawatts of generation capacity to rivals .
brussels said it would ask eon 's customers and competitors for their views on the proposal , and would close the antitrust cases once a legally binding decision was made . eu aims to lower prices the eu 's investigations concerned problems in the power sector where , according to brussels , former state-run monopolies had too much control over the supply chain , keeping prices high and limiting much-needed investment to expand capacity . " we have been aware for some time that eon but also rwe and vattenfall are in close touch with investment banks to sell their grids , " claude turmes , a member of the european parliament 's energy committee for the greens group , told reuters .
" this is a tipping point in the debate . " rwe , germany 's second-largest utility , said it was not going to sell its grid . a spokesman for vattenfall europe , a swedish-based company that is vertically integrated in germany , confirmed that it was looking at alternative ownership structures for its german transmission network . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in january , a court in the northern state of schleswig-holstein reached a similar conclusion , saying swedish energy company vattenfall could not transfer energy output from muehlheim-kaerlich , where it also has a power plant , to a power plant in brunsbüttel . each nuclear power plant 's remaining operational time is measured in terms of the amount of power it is allowed to generate .
a 2002 law governing germany 's plans to eliminate nuclear power only allows a company to transfer energy output from one plant to another in very specific cases . utilities vs. public opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-nuke activists say it is a greener energy alternative rwe had asked to transfer the allowance to produce 30 terawatt hours of electricity from muehlheim-kaerlich to biblis a. without the transfer the biblis a plant would run until about september 2009 .

in january , a court in the northern state of schleswig-holstein reached a similar conclusion , saying swedish energy company vattenfall could not transfer energy output from muehlheim-kaerlich , where it also has a power plant , to a power plant in brunsbüttel . each nuclear power plant 's remaining operational time is measured in terms of the amount of power it is allowed to generate .
a 2002 law governing germany 's plans to eliminate nuclear power only allows a company to transfer energy output from one plant to another in very specific cases . utilities vs. public opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-nuke activists say it is a greener energy alternative rwe had asked to transfer the allowance to produce 30 terawatt hours of electricity from muehlheim-kaerlich to biblis a. without the transfer the biblis a plant would run until about september 2009 .

some government officials and renewable energy experts say he 's needlessly spreading panic . power outages are a common occurrence not just in developing countries .
in the united states , for example , florida residents are still dealing with the chaos resulting from a wide-ranging blackout that affected nearly a million households .
in germany , though , people expect that when they flip a switch or plug in an appliance , power will be in ready supply . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the chaos that hit florida headed across the atlantic ?
this notion was put in doubt on thursday , feb .
28 , when juergen grossmann , the head of german power giant rwe , warned that germany and the rest of europe could experience power outages lasting several days this summer due to a lack of power stations . " power is growing short all over europe because there are not enough power stations , " grossmann told the bild newspaper .
" right now , all we need is the combination of a hot , dry summer and the shutdown of more power stations for maintenance for power security to be endangered . " no energy gap , government says his comments were repudiated on friday by government officials and representatives of some parts of the energy sector . environment ministry spokesman michael schroeren said it would be mistaken for germans to believe that the lights would go out and people would be unable to operate their washing machines due to a lack of power this summer . " all the figures show that there is no reason to speak of an energy gap , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one expert said there 's no reason for germans to stock up on candles schroeren added that while it is true that energy production can be restricted during periods of very hot weather , german citizens generally do not feel the effects . the federal association for hydropower and energy -lrb- bdew -rrb- said that " potential shortages could be the result if many negative factors were to come together at once . " germany 's renewable energy branch reacted with scorn to grossmann 's comments .
the head of the federal association for renewable energy -lrb- bee -rrb- , milan nitzschke , said there are no energy gaps in germany . " this is pure fear-mongering , " he added . competing interests in german " energy mix " there has been ongoing debate in germany about the country 's optimal " energy mix . " germany has committed to a total phase-out of nuclear power by 2020 and to increasing the proportion of energy that comes from renewable sources .
chancellor angela merkel , however , has spoken out for an energy mix that includes nuclear power , as well as more energy generated by coal-fired power stations . merkel 's government plans to build up to 25 new coal-fired plants in order to fill the gap left when nuclear plants are taken offline .
the plans have met with enormous resistance from environmental groups and citizens ' initiatives who see the plans as a backwards step for a country that is meant to be assuming a leading role worldwide in the promotion of clean energy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

apart from irritating the french , he 's been ruffling feathers abroad - most recently in berlin . scheduling difficulties - this diplomatic euphemism was the official reason from paris for letting two franco-german meetings slip through the cracks this week . french finance minister christine lagarde should have been received by her german counterpart , peer steinbrueck , on tuesday , feb .
26 , but le president had something else in mind : he took the minister on a trip to visit businesses in the countryside .
after all , local elections take place on march 9 and 16 , so bilateral relations apparently have to take a backseat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are n't quite so amicable right now several days ago , sarkozy postponed a march 3 meeting with chancellor angela merkel by three months .
the unofficial summit had been planned far in advance . " club med " concerns chancellor at the diplomatic level , the cancellations are brushed off as inconsequential .
but it 's no a secret that ties between paris and berlin are n't exactly close .
the german chancellor is still disgruntled about sarkozy 's mediterranean union initative .
originally conceived as a kind of consolation prize for turkey , which sarkozy does n't want in the eu , it 's become a serious project for the french president . germany , however , is worried that france is splitting the eu and looking to take a leadership role in europe .
and sarkozy 's invitation to the mediterranean heads of state to visit paris on july 13 - one day before the rest of the eu heads of state arrive to celebrate france taking over the eu presidency - did nothing to dispel concerns . berlin is not alone in its irritation with the french president , who took office in may last year . broken promises , tactless plans in january of this year , he promised french fishermen that he would do away with fishing quotas when his country assumes the eu presidency on july 1 .

the partner countries own a one-third share in the francophone broadcaster . distracted by local campaign but any judgements on sarkozy 's foreign policy should take into account that he 's under significant pressure abroad , said the director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg , frank baasner .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france takes over the eu presidency in july " france 's foreign policy is domestic policy , for the time being . " in de gaulle 's footsteps sarkozy is not the first president to be accused of going it alone or displaying his omnipotence .
charles de gaulle , the resistance general and post-war president made france into a nuclear power independent of the united states .
in 1962 , he called for a " europe of fatherlands " led by france . baasner pointed to the continuity between de gaulle and sarkozy .
the idea that europe is an extension of france is deeply rooted in the french consciousness , he said . but france 's current president also has his own style , said baasner .
" what surprises even the french is the coolness , the near aggressiveness of his style . " that aggressiveness was most recently on display earlier this week when , during a visit to a paris agricultural fair , sarkozy insulted a bystander who refused to shake his hand , telling the man to " get lost , " followed by some choice french expletives . nevertheless , many european leaders have had to go through crises before finally becoming grounded .

family affairs minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the decision , saying it showed the government was facing up to its responsibilites .
" we can not overvalue the extraordinary achievements of thalidomide victims , who have fought for success in their professional and private lives , " she said .
" they deserve society 's respect . "
" i am also confident that the government can cooperate with the gruenenthal company to develop a plan for further benefits to thalidomide victims , " she added . " talks begun in 2007 on how to improve their situation have been promising . "
extra help needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drug claimed 10,000 victims all over the world the move came after a public outcry against germany 's limited help for aging thalidomide victims .
around 10,000 babies around the world were born with disabilities as a result of their mothers taking the drug , marketed in germany under the brand name contergan . just under half of those survived .
others learned to live with disabilities such as extremely shortened or missing limbs , or missing organs .
the over-the-counter remedy was taken off the market four years after its launch and better drug regulation introduced round the globe .
but 50 years on , the victims are now middle-aged .
with their parents dying off , they need extra help to relieve sore joints and compensate for a life of poor earnings .
currently the 2,870 victims in germany receive a stipend of up to 545 euros monthly , depending on their degree of disability , from a trust fund set up by gruenenthal and the german government .
the pharmaceuticals company paid 100 million deutsche marks -lrb- 51.13 million euros -rrb- into the compensation fund in 1971 after a criminal trial following thalidomide 's withdrawal , but has not provided any additional support for the fund since ..
german victims have demanded a tripling of the stipend , saying victims in britain and elsewhere were compensated better .

some government officials and renewable energy experts say he 's needlessly spreading panic . power outages are a common occurrence not just in developing countries .
in the united states , for example , florida residents are still dealing with the chaos resulting from a wide-ranging blackout that affected nearly a million households .
in germany , though , people expect that when they flip a switch or plug in an appliance , power will be in ready supply . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the chaos that hit florida headed across the atlantic ?
this notion was put in doubt on thursday , feb .
28 , when juergen grossmann , the head of german power giant rwe , warned that germany and the rest of europe could experience power outages lasting several days this summer due to a lack of power stations . " power is growing short all over europe because there are not enough power stations , " grossmann told the bild newspaper .
" right now , all we need is the combination of a hot , dry summer and the shutdown of more power stations for maintenance for power security to be endangered . " no energy gap , government says his comments were repudiated on friday by government officials and representatives of some parts of the energy sector . environment ministry spokesman michael schroeren said it would be mistaken for germans to believe that the lights would go out and people would be unable to operate their washing machines due to a lack of power this summer . " all the figures show that there is no reason to speak of an energy gap , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one expert said there 's no reason for germans to stock up on candles schroeren added that while it is true that energy production can be restricted during periods of very hot weather , german citizens generally do not feel the effects . the federal association for hydropower and energy -lrb- bdew -rrb- said that " potential shortages could be the result if many negative factors were to come together at once . " germany 's renewable energy branch reacted with scorn to grossmann 's comments .
the head of the federal association for renewable energy -lrb- bee -rrb- , milan nitzschke , said there are no energy gaps in germany . " this is pure fear-mongering , " he added . competing interests in german " energy mix " there has been ongoing debate in germany about the country 's optimal " energy mix . " germany has committed to a total phase-out of nuclear power by 2020 and to increasing the proportion of energy that comes from renewable sources .
chancellor angela merkel , however , has spoken out for an energy mix that includes nuclear power , as well as more energy generated by coal-fired power stations . merkel 's government plans to build up to 25 new coal-fired plants in order to fill the gap left when nuclear plants are taken offline .
the plans have met with enormous resistance from environmental groups and citizens ' initiatives who see the plans as a backwards step for a country that is meant to be assuming a leading role worldwide in the promotion of clean energy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 28.02.2008 germans question methods to obtain info on tax evaders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the millions of recouped tax euros make up for bending the law ?
the german government 's crackdown on tax evaders comes courtesy of stolen bank data , for which germany 's intelligence service , the bnd , paid millions .
but now many have begun to ask : does the end justify the means ? investigators probing the scale of tax evasion by germans have already uncovered some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in funds stashed in trusts in liechtenstein - and that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
by the time investigators have finished , the 4.2 million euros paid to an informant alleged to have stolen client data from liechtenstein 's lgt bank in 2002 will look like a bargain-basement price in comparison with the vast sums reclaimed by the german finance ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the data bought by the bnd was reportedly stolen from the lgt group in 2002 despite this , the whole affair is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many ordinary germans as well as politicians who take issue with the methods used by the government to obtain the liechtenstein bank data .
a poll showed that 52 percent of voters think the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- should not have paid for the information , while just 41 percent think the payment was justified .
" ordinary germans feel a certain solidarity with the people who are now being investigated for tax evasion , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university .
" on some level , this is something everyone in germany tries to do , whether that involves writing off bigger sums in your tax declaration than you should , getting paid for work that you do n't declare or paying someone to work under the table for you , " he added .
" these people also do n't want to be caught , and so they have something against the government using such methods to pursue tax evaders . "
a great deal or a criminal act ?
the bnd normally has nothing to do with tax matters , but officials say it was offered the information and only acted on it after consulting the government and tax authorities .
a notarized contract for the sum paid to the informant was drawn up , and detailed records were kept every step of the way .
according to finance ministry officials , there 's no doubt that the data will be admissible in court .
finance minister peer steinbrück said he did n't want to imagine the " wave of indignation that would roll through the country " if the bnd had acted any differently .
but ferdinand von schirach , one of two lawyers who have said so far that they plan to sue the german state for its handling of the affair , said the government can not use taxpayers ' money to reward criminal acts - such as the stealing of confidential bank information .
" even though it seems like a great deal … a crime can not be committed , " he told reuters tv .
" if that was the case , the state would be no better than any criminal on the street . "
bnd must answer to parliamentary committee last week , the bnd was asked to brief a parliamentary committee on its methods so that the government could decide whether to approve or disapprove of the liechtenstein operation , but members of the parliamentary intelligence committee deemed more documents were needed .
the next briefing is set for march 5 .
speaking to the berlin-based newspaper , taz , following the initial briefing , green party parliamentarian christian ströbele stressed the need for rule of law , even when it comes to hunting down tax evaders .
" putting aside my joy that the right people are finally being targeted , the law has to be followed here , even against our richest citizens , " ströbele said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neskovic : bnd 's behavior is " clearly illegal " left party parliamentarian wolfgang neskovic was more critical .
" the bnd 's behavior is , in my view , clearly illegal , " he said .
but neskovic doubts whether the parliamentary session on march 5 will lead to any consequences for the intelligence agency .
" in this republic , there are unchecked zones , especially when it comes to the intelligence service , and this has to change , " said neskovic , a former federal court justice .
" what we know of up to now is just a drop , and what we do n't know amounts to an ocean . "
liechtenstein furious over german tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince alois says germany is attacking his nation the acting head of liechtenstein , hereditary prince alois , has described the bnd 's behavior as " highly suspect . "
he said the informant , who has been identified as former lgt bank employee heinrich kieber , had been convicted of stealing bank data in 2002 and imprisoned .
" obviously , germany wants to be a big-time receiver of stolen goods , " he said , also making thinly veiled references to germany 's past aggression in europe .
" we are also a sovereign state and - we hope - do not live in an era where might makes right . "
contributing to the war of words that 's been started with the tiny alpine state , german chancellor angela merkel accused liechtenstein 's banks of " encouraging lawbreaking , " and said that it and other tax havens should " mend their ways " or face the consequences .
swiss banks suspicious of espionage one of the consequences already emerging from the bnd 's liechtenstein operation is that germans applying for jobs at swiss banks will undergo additional scrutiny in future because of espionage concerns .
the thousands of germans already working in switzerland 's financial industry could also feel the effects of the german government 's crackdown .
the head of switzerland 's private banker 's association , michel derobert , said the methods used by the bnd to obtain the secret banking data from liechtenstein were " reprehensible " and would lead to extra precautions in switzerland to protect client privacy .
germany 's purchase of the data will discourage swiss banks from employing germans , he told the swiss daily le matin . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

basic rights are n't disposable , says dw 's daphne antachopoulos . the court decision follows the same guideline as many other verdicts from the constitutional court in karlsruhe : security laws may not undermine basic rights . the judges reached a similar conclusion in deciding whether to allow authorities to bug private apartments or shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked by terrorists .
human and civil rights take precedence over the nearly insatiable need for security cultivated by some politicians . the now invalid law in north rhine-westphalia had allowed authorities to access a suspect 's hard drive and keep it under regular surveillance - under the condition that they expected to find evidence of anti-constitutional activity . such a massive intrusion should not be possible on such vague grounds , the karlsruhe court decided .
rather , the state may secretly spy on someone only if there is strong evidence that personal safety , lives , freedom , state property or the foundation of human existence are endangered .
and only with permission from a judge . those are high hurdles .
and that 's how they should be . it was n't a coincidence that court president hans-juergen papier said the decision had implications beyond the case in north rhine-westphalia .
his words were directed at interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who is planning a federal law allowing for online surveillance of crime suspects . schaeuble 's credo is that the threat of terrorism is omnipresent , invisible and incalculable .
therefore , the state should take such measures in order to prevent this danger .
according to schaeuble , all surveillance and combat instruments should be able to be used even in fully abstract situations of danger . fortunately , karlsruhe clamped down first .
basic rights are n't disposable regardless of the need for security .
the criteria for state action must be very concretely defined , particularly when a basic right is so massively intruded upon .
innocent people should not be targeted by the state with such sweeping , preventive blows . wednesday 's court decision recalled yet another axiom : not only do we need protection by the state but also from the state . if every citizen is treated like a potential terrorist and his or her private sphere is monitored , the state will have a hard time convincing its citizens that it also wants to protect them . wolfgang schaeuble said he will take the court decision into account .
the question remains why these kinds of issues always have to be resolved in karlsruhe and not first in berlin . it seems as if politicians responsible for security always want to test the boundaries - and the constitutional court is then forced to draw the line . daphne antachopoulos is a reporter for deutsche welle specializing in german domestic and foreign policy . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu leaders want it to lead to more cooperation fighting tax evasion as well . liechtenstein prime minister otmar hasler on thursday , feb .

" the first-step accord to allow liechtenstein in the 24-nation schengen bloc came despite a tax fraud row with germany , which had threatened to block the move .
the tiny alpine principality has been accused of encouraging tax fraud with its lax fiscal code . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is among three osce-recognized tax havens an eu official told afp that " the subject passed without any debate " at a meeting of european union interior and justice ministers in brussels . the european justice and security commissioner franco frattini said the tax evasion investigations involving liechtenstein should not prevent the country from entering the visa-free travel zone . " -lsb- it -rsb- is very important to get liechtenstein in the schengen area , it is simply not possible to have an enclave in the center of europe , " frattini said before the signing ceremony . awaiting ratification the exact date of liechtenstein 's entry into the schengen area has not yet been set , but it has been closely tied to the adhesion of its bigger neighbor switzerland , which is due to join by november . the protocol allowing liechtenstein to implement schengen rules still needs to be ratified by all 27 eu nations , which could present an opportunity for one of them to use schengen to gain leverage over it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : problems could arise from a borderless tax haven germany spearheaded the crackdown on tax havens amid suspicions that hundreds of rich germans evaded taxes by parking money in liechtenstein banks .
despite this , however , germany has opted against vetoing the principality 's entry into the schengen agreement . asked if germany would hold off on approving liechtenstein 's accession to the european border-free area , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told reporters , " in principle we are willing to ratify it , but there have been talks -lsb- on combating fraud -rsb- , and they have to show some effect . " in addition to germany , investigators in the united states , britain , australia , italy , france , sweden , canada , new zealand , greece and spain are among the countries now hunting for nationals hiding their money in liechtenstein . currently on the blacklist hasler said his country is now seeking a " reasonable " tax fraud deal with the eu . " with respect to the current tax policy questions that are broadly and controversially debated in europe , we want to play our part in finding a reasonable agreement , " hasler told reuters news service .

" we will use pressure and influence on an eu level , " steinbrueck told the ruhr nachrichten newspaper . eu finance ministers plan to talk again on march 5 to discuss the topic .

eu leaders want it to lead to more cooperation fighting tax evasion as well . liechtenstein prime minister otmar hasler on thursday , feb .
28 , welcomed an accord opening the way for his nation to enter europe 's open borders area , telling afp news agency it would be " an important step for integration and cooperation on fiscal matters . " the first-step accord to allow liechtenstein in the 24-nation schengen bloc came despite a tax fraud row with germany , which had threatened to block the move .
the tiny alpine principality has been accused of encouraging tax fraud with its lax fiscal code . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is among three osce-recognized tax havens an eu official told afp that " the subject passed without any debate " at a meeting of european union interior and justice ministers in brussels . the european justice and security commissioner franco frattini said the tax evasion investigations involving liechtenstein should not prevent the country from entering the visa-free travel zone . " -lsb- it -rsb- is very important to get liechtenstein in the schengen area , it is simply not possible to have an enclave in the center of europe , " frattini said before the signing ceremony . awaiting ratification the exact date of liechtenstein 's entry into the schengen area has not yet been set , but it has been closely tied to the adhesion of its bigger neighbor switzerland , which is due to join by november . the protocol allowing liechtenstein to implement schengen rules still needs to be ratified by all 27 eu nations , which could present an opportunity for one of them to use schengen to gain leverage over it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : problems could arise from a borderless tax haven germany spearheaded the crackdown on tax havens amid suspicions that hundreds of rich germans evaded taxes by parking money in liechtenstein banks .
despite this , however , germany has opted against vetoing the principality 's entry into the schengen agreement . asked if germany would hold off on approving liechtenstein 's accession to the european border-free area , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told reporters , " in principle we are willing to ratify it , but there have been talks -lsb- on combating fraud -rsb- , and they have to show some effect . " in addition to germany , investigators in the united states , britain , australia , italy , france , sweden , canada , new zealand , greece and spain are among the countries now hunting for nationals hiding their money in liechtenstein . currently on the blacklist hasler said his country is now seeking a " reasonable " tax fraud deal with the eu . " with respect to the current tax policy questions that are broadly and controversially debated in europe , we want to play our part in finding a reasonable agreement , " hasler told reuters news service .
" our aim is to achieve a successful conclusion of the comprehensive tax fraud agreement that is currently under negotiation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alpine country said would agree to a " reasonable " deal with the eu on tax matters liechtenstein is one of three countries on the organization for economic cooperation and development 's black list of uncooperative tax havens , alongside andorra and monaco . german chancellor angela merkel told hasler last week to take rapid action to combat fraud and make the principality 's finance sector more transparent . germany threatens measures after meeting with other eu finance ministers in brussels on thursday , german finance minister peer steinbrueck warned liechtenstein would face strong measures if there were no changes on the european level . " we will use pressure and influence on an eu level , " steinbrueck told the ruhr nachrichten newspaper . eu finance ministers plan to talk again on march 5 to discuss the topic .
if progress is n't made in europe as a whole , " then we will take measures within germany , " steinbrueck said . measures could include instituting disclosure requirements , or perhaps taxation at the source of every money transfer from germany to liechtenstein , he added . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" power is growing short all over europe because there are not enough power stations , " grossmann told the bild newspaper .
" right now , all we need is the combination of a hot , dry summer and the shutdown of more power stations for maintenance for power security to be endangered . " no energy gap , government says his comments were repudiated on friday by government officials and representatives of some parts of the energy sector . environment ministry spokesman michael schroeren said it would be mistaken for germans to believe that the lights would go out and people would be unable to operate their washing machines due to a lack of power this summer .

" germany 's renewable energy branch reacted with scorn to grossmann 's comments .
the head of the federal association for renewable energy -lrb- bee -rrb- , milan nitzschke , said there are no energy gaps in germany .

chancellor angela merkel , however , has spoken out for an energy mix that includes nuclear power , as well as more energy generated by coal-fired power stations . merkel 's government plans to build up to 25 new coal-fired plants in order to fill the gap left when nuclear plants are taken offline .

still , the news is likely to have come as a surprise , as the german government had made a point of lobbying in brussels for the company to avoid such a sell-off . the company has also promised to divest 4,800 megawatts of generation capacity to rivals .
brussels said it would ask eon 's customers and competitors for their views on the proposal , and would close the antitrust cases once a legally binding decision was made . eu aims to lower prices the eu 's investigations concerned problems in the power sector where , according to brussels , former state-run monopolies had too much control over the supply chain , keeping prices high and limiting much-needed investment to expand capacity . " we have been aware for some time that eon but also rwe and vattenfall are in close touch with investment banks to sell their grids , " claude turmes , a member of the european parliament 's energy committee for the greens group , told reuters .
" this is a tipping point in the debate . " rwe , germany 's second-largest utility , said it was not going to sell its grid . a spokesman for vattenfall europe , a swedish-based company that is vertically integrated in germany , confirmed that it was looking at alternative ownership structures for its german transmission network . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some government officials and renewable energy experts say he 's needlessly spreading panic . power outages are a common occurrence not just in developing countries .
in the united states , for example , florida residents are still dealing with the chaos resulting from a wide-ranging blackout that affected nearly a million households .
in germany , though , people expect that when they flip a switch or plug in an appliance , power will be in ready supply . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the chaos that hit florida headed across the atlantic ?
this notion was put in doubt on thursday , feb .
28 , when juergen grossmann , the head of german power giant rwe , warned that germany and the rest of europe could experience power outages lasting several days this summer due to a lack of power stations . " power is growing short all over europe because there are not enough power stations , " grossmann told the bild newspaper .
" right now , all we need is the combination of a hot , dry summer and the shutdown of more power stations for maintenance for power security to be endangered . " no energy gap , government says his comments were repudiated on friday by government officials and representatives of some parts of the energy sector . environment ministry spokesman michael schroeren said it would be mistaken for germans to believe that the lights would go out and people would be unable to operate their washing machines due to a lack of power this summer . " all the figures show that there is no reason to speak of an energy gap , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one expert said there 's no reason for germans to stock up on candles schroeren added that while it is true that energy production can be restricted during periods of very hot weather , german citizens generally do not feel the effects . the federal association for hydropower and energy -lrb- bdew -rrb- said that " potential shortages could be the result if many negative factors were to come together at once . " germany 's renewable energy branch reacted with scorn to grossmann 's comments .
the head of the federal association for renewable energy -lrb- bee -rrb- , milan nitzschke , said there are no energy gaps in germany . " this is pure fear-mongering , " he added . competing interests in german " energy mix " there has been ongoing debate in germany about the country 's optimal " energy mix .

the german chancellor is still disgruntled about sarkozy 's mediterranean union initative .
originally conceived as a kind of consolation prize for turkey , which sarkozy does n't want in the eu , it 's become a serious project for the french president . germany , however , is worried that france is splitting the eu and looking to take a leadership role in europe .

the partner countries own a one-third share in the francophone broadcaster . distracted by local campaign but any judgements on sarkozy 's foreign policy should take into account that he 's under significant pressure abroad , said the director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg , frank baasner .

agriculture minister michel barnier was hard-pressed to calm the ensuing storm of protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france does n't want turkey in the eu but suggested an association treaty for ukraine in early february , eu commission president jose manuel barroso reprimanded the french government for not making enough of an effort to economize . also at the beginning of the month , french diplomats came up with the idea of an association treaty with ukraine at a time when , according to the german weekly die zeit , speculations over an eastward eu expansion are taboo . what 's more , french-speakers in switzerland , canada and belgium are furious that sarkozy wants to integrate broadcaster tv 5 monde in a purely french holding company .
the partner countries own a one-third share in the francophone broadcaster . distracted by local campaign but any judgements on sarkozy 's foreign policy should take into account that he 's under significant pressure abroad , said the director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg , frank baasner . " there are just a few weeks until the local elections , " said baasner .
" if his party suffers a setback , his popularity will be completely lost . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france takes over the eu presidency in july " france 's foreign policy is domestic policy , for the time being . " in de gaulle 's footsteps sarkozy is not the first president to be accused of going it alone or displaying his omnipotence .
charles de gaulle , the resistance general and post-war president made france into a nuclear power independent of the united states .
in 1962 , he called for a " europe of fatherlands " led by france . baasner pointed to the continuity between de gaulle and sarkozy .
the idea that europe is an extension of france is deeply rooted in the french consciousness , he said . but france 's current president also has his own style , said baasner .
" what surprises even the french is the coolness , the near aggressiveness of his style . " that aggressiveness was most recently on display earlier this week when , during a visit to a paris agricultural fair , sarkozy insulted a bystander who refused to shake his hand , telling the man to " get lost , " followed by some choice french expletives . nevertheless , many european leaders have had to go through crises before finally becoming grounded .
sarkozy - and france - may just have to prepare for a process of refinement " through the power of reality , " baasner said . andreas leixnering -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 28.02.2008 germans question methods to obtain info on tax evaders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the millions of recouped tax euros make up for bending the law ?
the german government 's crackdown on tax evaders comes courtesy of stolen bank data , for which germany 's intelligence service , the bnd , paid millions .
but now many have begun to ask : does the end justify the means ? investigators probing the scale of tax evasion by germans have already uncovered some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in funds stashed in trusts in liechtenstein - and that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
by the time investigators have finished , the 4.2 million euros paid to an informant alleged to have stolen client data from liechtenstein 's lgt bank in 2002 will look like a bargain-basement price in comparison with the vast sums reclaimed by the german finance ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the data bought by the bnd was reportedly stolen from the lgt group in 2002 despite this , the whole affair is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many ordinary germans as well as politicians who take issue with the methods used by the government to obtain the liechtenstein bank data .
a poll showed that 52 percent of voters think the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- should not have paid for the information , while just 41 percent think the payment was justified .
" ordinary germans feel a certain solidarity with the people who are now being investigated for tax evasion , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university .
" on some level , this is something everyone in germany tries to do , whether that involves writing off bigger sums in your tax declaration than you should , getting paid for work that you do n't declare or paying someone to work under the table for you , " he added .
" these people also do n't want to be caught , and so they have something against the government using such methods to pursue tax evaders . "
a great deal or a criminal act ?
the bnd normally has nothing to do with tax matters , but officials say it was offered the information and only acted on it after consulting the government and tax authorities .
a notarized contract for the sum paid to the informant was drawn up , and detailed records were kept every step of the way .
according to finance ministry officials , there 's no doubt that the data will be admissible in court .
finance minister peer steinbrück said he did n't want to imagine the " wave of indignation that would roll through the country " if the bnd had acted any differently .
but ferdinand von schirach , one of two lawyers who have said so far that they plan to sue the german state for its handling of the affair , said the government can not use taxpayers ' money to reward criminal acts - such as the stealing of confidential bank information .
" even though it seems like a great deal … a crime can not be committed , " he told reuters tv .
" if that was the case , the state would be no better than any criminal on the street . "
bnd must answer to parliamentary committee last week , the bnd was asked to brief a parliamentary committee on its methods so that the government could decide whether to approve or disapprove of the liechtenstein operation , but members of the parliamentary intelligence committee deemed more documents were needed .
the next briefing is set for march 5 .
speaking to the berlin-based newspaper , taz , following the initial briefing , green party parliamentarian christian ströbele stressed the need for rule of law , even when it comes to hunting down tax evaders .
" putting aside my joy that the right people are finally being targeted , the law has to be followed here , even against our richest citizens , " ströbele said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neskovic : bnd 's behavior is " clearly illegal " left party parliamentarian wolfgang neskovic was more critical .
" the bnd 's behavior is , in my view , clearly illegal , " he said .
but neskovic doubts whether the parliamentary session on march 5 will lead to any consequences for the intelligence agency .
" in this republic , there are unchecked zones , especially when it comes to the intelligence service , and this has to change , " said neskovic , a former federal court justice .
" what we know of up to now is just a drop , and what we do n't know amounts to an ocean . "
liechtenstein furious over german tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince alois says germany is attacking his nation the acting head of liechtenstein , hereditary prince alois , has described the bnd 's behavior as " highly suspect . "
he said the informant , who has been identified as former lgt bank employee heinrich kieber , had been convicted of stealing bank data in 2002 and imprisoned .
" obviously , germany wants to be a big-time receiver of stolen goods , " he said , also making thinly veiled references to germany 's past aggression in europe .
" we are also a sovereign state and - we hope - do not live in an era where might makes right . "
contributing to the war of words that 's been started with the tiny alpine state , german chancellor angela merkel accused liechtenstein 's banks of " encouraging lawbreaking , " and said that it and other tax havens should " mend their ways " or face the consequences .
swiss banks suspicious of espionage one of the consequences already emerging from the bnd 's liechtenstein operation is that germans applying for jobs at swiss banks will undergo additional scrutiny in future because of espionage concerns .
the thousands of germans already working in switzerland 's financial industry could also feel the effects of the german government 's crackdown .
the head of switzerland 's private banker 's association , michel derobert , said the methods used by the bnd to obtain the secret banking data from liechtenstein were " reprehensible " and would lead to extra precautions in switzerland to protect client privacy .
germany 's purchase of the data will discourage swiss banks from employing germans , he told the swiss daily le matin . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans have already begun to confess .
-lrb- 26.02.2008 -rrb- germany wants broader tax-haven crackdown in europe germany could limit business with liechtenstein and include other european countries in its efforts to crack down on tax-havens , said finance minister peer steinbrueck in an interview released on saturday , dec .

the eu hopes other power companies will follow eon 's lead . the eu 's executive body said on thursday , feb .
28 , that it would check whether the move by eon will end the company 's antitrust problems .
the european commission has been trying for years to push energy companies to divest their grids in order to increase competition in the electricity and gas market and make prices more consumer-friendly . eu leaders agreed last year to separate power production from distribution networks .
the commission favors complete " ownership unbundling " or having an independent company to run pipelines and energy grids , but a group of eight countries , led by france and germany , was pursuing an alternative to avoid the break-up of their vertically integrated utilities . eon 's announcement on thursday came as a complete turnaround . " eon proposes to commit to sell its electricity transmission system network to an operator which would have no interest in the electricity generation and / or supply business , " the european commission said in a statement . move could end antitrust inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels will now check whether it antitrust proceedings against eon can be dropped eu economics ministers were meeting in brussels on thursday to discuss ways of increasing competition in the gas and power sector .
eu energy commissioner andris pielbalgs welcomed eon 's decision , adding that he hoped other companies would act in a similar fashion . wulf bernotat , chief executive of eon , had discussed the possible sale with german chancellor angela merkel , a government spokesperson said .
still , the news is likely to have come as a surprise , as the german government had made a point of lobbying in brussels for the company to avoid such a sell-off . the company has also promised to divest 4,800 megawatts of generation capacity to rivals .
brussels said it would ask eon 's customers and competitors for their views on the proposal , and would close the antitrust cases once a legally binding decision was made . eu aims to lower prices the eu 's investigations concerned problems in the power sector where , according to brussels , former state-run monopolies had too much control over the supply chain , keeping prices high and limiting much-needed investment to expand capacity . " we have been aware for some time that eon but also rwe and vattenfall are in close touch with investment banks to sell their grids , " claude turmes , a member of the european parliament 's energy committee for the greens group , told reuters .
" this is a tipping point in the debate . " rwe , germany 's second-largest utility , said it was not going to sell its grid . a spokesman for vattenfall europe , a swedish-based company that is vertically integrated in germany , confirmed that it was looking at alternative ownership structures for its german transmission network . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 28.02.2008 germans question methods to obtain info on tax evaders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the millions of recouped tax euros make up for bending the law ?
the german government 's crackdown on tax evaders comes courtesy of stolen bank data , for which germany 's intelligence service , the bnd , paid millions .
but now many have begun to ask : does the end justify the means ? investigators probing the scale of tax evasion by germans have already uncovered some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in funds stashed in trusts in liechtenstein - and that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
by the time investigators have finished , the 4.2 million euros paid to an informant alleged to have stolen client data from liechtenstein 's lgt bank in 2002 will look like a bargain-basement price in comparison with the vast sums reclaimed by the german finance ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the data bought by the bnd was reportedly stolen from the lgt group in 2002 despite this , the whole affair is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many ordinary germans as well as politicians who take issue with the methods used by the government to obtain the liechtenstein bank data .
a poll showed that 52 percent of voters think the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- should not have paid for the information , while just 41 percent think the payment was justified .
" ordinary germans feel a certain solidarity with the people who are now being investigated for tax evasion , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university .
" on some level , this is something everyone in germany tries to do , whether that involves writing off bigger sums in your tax declaration than you should , getting paid for work that you do n't declare or paying someone to work under the table for you , " he added .
" these people also do n't want to be caught , and so they have something against the government using such methods to pursue tax evaders . "
a great deal or a criminal act ?
the bnd normally has nothing to do with tax matters , but officials say it was offered the information and only acted on it after consulting the government and tax authorities .
a notarized contract for the sum paid to the informant was drawn up , and detailed records were kept every step of the way .
according to finance ministry officials , there 's no doubt that the data will be admissible in court .
finance minister peer steinbrück said he did n't want to imagine the " wave of indignation that would roll through the country " if the bnd had acted any differently .
but ferdinand von schirach , one of two lawyers who have said so far that they plan to sue the german state for its handling of the affair , said the government can not use taxpayers ' money to reward criminal acts - such as the stealing of confidential bank information .
" even though it seems like a great deal … a crime can not be committed , " he told reuters tv .
" if that was the case , the state would be no better than any criminal on the street . "
bnd must answer to parliamentary committee last week , the bnd was asked to brief a parliamentary committee on its methods so that the government could decide whether to approve or disapprove of the liechtenstein operation , but members of the parliamentary intelligence committee deemed more documents were needed .
the next briefing is set for march 5 .
speaking to the berlin-based newspaper , taz , following the initial briefing , green party parliamentarian christian ströbele stressed the need for rule of law , even when it comes to hunting down tax evaders .
" putting aside my joy that the right people are finally being targeted , the law has to be followed here , even against our richest citizens , " ströbele said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neskovic : bnd 's behavior is " clearly illegal " left party parliamentarian wolfgang neskovic was more critical .
" the bnd 's behavior is , in my view , clearly illegal , " he said .
but neskovic doubts whether the parliamentary session on march 5 will lead to any consequences for the intelligence agency .
" in this republic , there are unchecked zones , especially when it comes to the intelligence service , and this has to change , " said neskovic , a former federal court justice .
" what we know of up to now is just a drop , and what we do n't know amounts to an ocean . "
liechtenstein furious over german tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince alois says germany is attacking his nation the acting head of liechtenstein , hereditary prince alois , has described the bnd 's behavior as " highly suspect . "
he said the informant , who has been identified as former lgt bank employee heinrich kieber , had been convicted of stealing bank data in 2002 and imprisoned .
" obviously , germany wants to be a big-time receiver of stolen goods , " he said , also making thinly veiled references to germany 's past aggression in europe .
" we are also a sovereign state and - we hope - do not live in an era where might makes right . "
contributing to the war of words that 's been started with the tiny alpine state , german chancellor angela merkel accused liechtenstein 's banks of " encouraging lawbreaking , " and said that it and other tax havens should " mend their ways " or face the consequences .
swiss banks suspicious of espionage one of the consequences already emerging from the bnd 's liechtenstein operation is that germans applying for jobs at swiss banks will undergo additional scrutiny in future because of espionage concerns .
the thousands of germans already working in switzerland 's financial industry could also feel the effects of the german government 's crackdown .
the head of switzerland 's private banker 's association , michel derobert , said the methods used by the bnd to obtain the secret banking data from liechtenstein were " reprehensible " and would lead to extra precautions in switzerland to protect client privacy .
germany 's purchase of the data will discourage swiss banks from employing germans , he told the swiss daily le matin . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

basic rights are n't disposable , says dw 's daphne antachopoulos . the court decision follows the same guideline as many other verdicts from the constitutional court in karlsruhe : security laws may not undermine basic rights . the judges reached a similar conclusion in deciding whether to allow authorities to bug private apartments or shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked by terrorists .
human and civil rights take precedence over the nearly insatiable need for security cultivated by some politicians . the now invalid law in north rhine-westphalia had allowed authorities to access a suspect 's hard drive and keep it under regular surveillance - under the condition that they expected to find evidence of anti-constitutional activity . such a massive intrusion should not be possible on such vague grounds , the karlsruhe court decided .
rather , the state may secretly spy on someone only if there is strong evidence that personal safety , lives , freedom , state property or the foundation of human existence are endangered .
and only with permission from a judge . those are high hurdles .
and that 's how they should be . it was n't a coincidence that court president hans-juergen papier said the decision had implications beyond the case in north rhine-westphalia .
his words were directed at interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who is planning a federal law allowing for online surveillance of crime suspects . schaeuble 's credo is that the threat of terrorism is omnipresent , invisible and incalculable .
therefore , the state should take such measures in order to prevent this danger .
according to schaeuble , all surveillance and combat instruments should be able to be used even in fully abstract situations of danger . fortunately , karlsruhe clamped down first .
basic rights are n't disposable regardless of the need for security .
the criteria for state action must be very concretely defined , particularly when a basic right is so massively intruded upon .

basic rights are n't disposable , says dw 's daphne antachopoulos . the court decision follows the same guideline as many other verdicts from the constitutional court in karlsruhe : security laws may not undermine basic rights . the judges reached a similar conclusion in deciding whether to allow authorities to bug private apartments or shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked by terrorists .
human and civil rights take precedence over the nearly insatiable need for security cultivated by some politicians . the now invalid law in north rhine-westphalia had allowed authorities to access a suspect 's hard drive and keep it under regular surveillance - under the condition that they expected to find evidence of anti-constitutional activity . such a massive intrusion should not be possible on such vague grounds , the karlsruhe court decided .
rather , the state may secretly spy on someone only if there is strong evidence that personal safety , lives , freedom , state property or the foundation of human existence are endangered .
and only with permission from a judge . those are high hurdles .
and that 's how they should be . it was n't a coincidence that court president hans-juergen papier said the decision had implications beyond the case in north rhine-westphalia .
his words were directed at interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who is planning a federal law allowing for online surveillance of crime suspects . schaeuble 's credo is that the threat of terrorism is omnipresent , invisible and incalculable .
therefore , the state should take such measures in order to prevent this danger .
according to schaeuble , all surveillance and combat instruments should be able to be used even in fully abstract situations of danger . fortunately , karlsruhe clamped down first .
basic rights are n't disposable regardless of the need for security .
the criteria for state action must be very concretely defined , particularly when a basic right is so massively intruded upon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 28.02.2008 eon gives in to eu pressure , sells power network großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eon will continue to produce energy , but someone else will distribute it in future in a shock move , german energy giant eon has said it will sell its power grid in order to end a major antitrust investigation by the european commission .
the eu hopes other power companies will follow eon 's lead . the eu 's executive body said on thursday , feb .
28 , that it would check whether the move by eon will end the company 's antitrust problems .
the european commission has been trying for years to push energy companies to divest their grids in order to increase competition in the electricity and gas market and make prices more consumer-friendly . eu leaders agreed last year to separate power production from distribution networks .
the commission favors complete " ownership unbundling " or having an independent company to run pipelines and energy grids , but a group of eight countries , led by france and germany , was pursuing an alternative to avoid the break-up of their vertically integrated utilities . eon 's announcement on thursday came as a complete turnaround . " eon proposes to commit to sell its electricity transmission system network to an operator which would have no interest in the electricity generation and / or supply business , " the european commission said in a statement . move could end antitrust inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels will now check whether it antitrust proceedings against eon can be dropped eu economics ministers were meeting in brussels on thursday to discuss ways of increasing competition in the gas and power sector .
eu energy commissioner andris pielbalgs welcomed eon 's decision , adding that he hoped other companies would act in a similar fashion . wulf bernotat , chief executive of eon , had discussed the possible sale with german chancellor angela merkel , a government spokesperson said .
still , the news is likely to have come as a surprise , as the german government had made a point of lobbying in brussels for the company to avoid such a sell-off . the company has also promised to divest 4,800 megawatts of generation capacity to rivals .
brussels said it would ask eon 's customers and competitors for their views on the proposal , and would close the antitrust cases once a legally binding decision was made . eu aims to lower prices the eu 's investigations concerned problems in the power sector where , according to brussels , former state-run monopolies had too much control over the supply chain , keeping prices high and limiting much-needed investment to expand capacity . " we have been aware for some time that eon but also rwe and vattenfall are in close touch with investment banks to sell their grids , " claude turmes , a member of the european parliament 's energy committee for the greens group , told reuters .
" this is a tipping point in the debate . " rwe , germany 's second-largest utility , said it was not going to sell its grid . a spokesman for vattenfall europe , a swedish-based company that is vertically integrated in germany , confirmed that it was looking at alternative ownership structures for its german transmission network . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government 's crackdown on tax evaders comes courtesy of stolen bank data , for which germany 's intelligence service , the bnd , paid millions .
but now many have begun to ask : does the end justify the means ? investigators probing the scale of tax evasion by germans have already uncovered some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in funds stashed in trusts in liechtenstein - and that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
by the time investigators have finished , the 4.2 million euros paid to an informant alleged to have stolen client data from liechtenstein 's lgt bank in 2002 will look like a bargain-basement price in comparison with the vast sums reclaimed by the german finance ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the data bought by the bnd was reportedly stolen from the lgt group in 2002 despite this , the whole affair is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many ordinary germans as well as politicians who take issue with the methods used by the government to obtain the liechtenstein bank data .
a poll showed that 52 percent of voters think the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- should not have paid for the information , while just 41 percent think the payment was justified .
" ordinary germans feel a certain solidarity with the people who are now being investigated for tax evasion , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university .
" on some level , this is something everyone in germany tries to do , whether that involves writing off bigger sums in your tax declaration than you should , getting paid for work that you do n't declare or paying someone to work under the table for you , " he added .
" these people also do n't want to be caught , and so they have something against the government using such methods to pursue tax evaders . "
a great deal or a criminal act ?
the bnd normally has nothing to do with tax matters , but officials say it was offered the information and only acted on it after consulting the government and tax authorities .
a notarized contract for the sum paid to the informant was drawn up , and detailed records were kept every step of the way .
according to finance ministry officials , there 's no doubt that the data will be admissible in court .
finance minister peer steinbrück said he did n't want to imagine the " wave of indignation that would roll through the country " if the bnd had acted any differently .
but ferdinand von schirach , one of two lawyers who have said so far that they plan to sue the german state for its handling of the affair , said the government can not use taxpayers ' money to reward criminal acts - such as the stealing of confidential bank information .
" even though it seems like a great deal … a crime can not be committed , " he told reuters tv .
" if that was the case , the state would be no better than any criminal on the street . "
bnd must answer to parliamentary committee last week , the bnd was asked to brief a parliamentary committee on its methods so that the government could decide whether to approve or disapprove of the liechtenstein operation , but members of the parliamentary intelligence committee deemed more documents were needed .
the next briefing is set for march 5 .
speaking to the berlin-based newspaper , taz , following the initial briefing , green party parliamentarian christian ströbele stressed the need for rule of law , even when it comes to hunting down tax evaders .
" putting aside my joy that the right people are finally being targeted , the law has to be followed here , even against our richest citizens , " ströbele said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neskovic : bnd 's behavior is " clearly illegal " left party parliamentarian wolfgang neskovic was more critical .
" the bnd 's behavior is , in my view , clearly illegal , " he said .
but neskovic doubts whether the parliamentary session on march 5 will lead to any consequences for the intelligence agency .
" in this republic , there are unchecked zones , especially when it comes to the intelligence service , and this has to change , " said neskovic , a former federal court justice .

he said the informant , who has been identified as former lgt bank employee heinrich kieber , had been convicted of stealing bank data in 2002 and imprisoned .
" obviously , germany wants to be a big-time receiver of stolen goods , " he said , also making thinly veiled references to germany 's past aggression in europe .
" we are also a sovereign state and - we hope - do not live in an era where might makes right . "
contributing to the war of words that 's been started with the tiny alpine state , german chancellor angela merkel accused liechtenstein 's banks of " encouraging lawbreaking , " and said that it and other tax havens should " mend their ways " or face the consequences .
swiss banks suspicious of espionage one of the consequences already emerging from the bnd 's liechtenstein operation is that germans applying for jobs at swiss banks will undergo additional scrutiny in future because of espionage concerns .
the thousands of germans already working in switzerland 's financial industry could also feel the effects of the german government 's crackdown .
the head of switzerland 's private banker 's association , michel derobert , said the methods used by the bnd to obtain the secret banking data from liechtenstein were " reprehensible " and would lead to extra precautions in switzerland to protect client privacy .

not the first in the area , the sale suggests the district has failed to become the thriving commercial center the city intended . sony said thursday , feb .
28 , that as part of its streamlining efforts , it would be selling the berlin sony center to a group of german and us investment funds , including investment bank morgan stanley , corpus sireo and an affiliate of the john buck company . the sprawling entertainment complex in the center of the german capital houses offices , stores , restaurants and a cinema and attracts over 8 million visitors a year .
but the company now says it plans to focus on core business areas such as electronics . the sony companies located on the premises will remain tenants , and the center will keep the group 's name , it said in a statement .
the sale is expected to be completed by the end of next month subject to regulatory approval . financial loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what does the future hold for potsdamer platz ?
the move is not entirely unexpected .
in 2006 , the iconic japanese company 's first foreign head , howard stringer , announced 10,000 job cuts and plans for a swathe of asset disposals in an effort to revive its flagging fortunes . the company did not divulge the value of the deal but said the expected profits had already been factored into its earlier forecast for a 471 percent surge in operating profit to 410 billion yen -lrb- $ 3.8 billion , 2.5 billion euros -rrb- in the current fiscal year to march . insiders say sony will be paid less than 600 million euros for the building that originally cost the japanese company 750 million euros in the late 1990s . a failed vision for the capital one of the most ambitious development projects in post-reunification germany , the spectacular domed building designed by architect helmut jahn first opened in june 2000 . it was hailed as a symbol of the new , reunited berlin .
but along with other real estate on potsdamer platz - such as the 19 buildings making up the daimler " quartier , " which sold to the swedish banking group seb last december for an estimated 1.2 billion euros - it failed to help turn the neighborhood into the capital 's new commercial district . to many , the sale will confirm suspicions of waning confidence in the potsdamer platz project - especially given that sony was allegedly unable to find a buyer willing to pay its initial asking price of 800 million euros . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government 's crackdown on tax evaders comes courtesy of stolen bank data , for which germany 's intelligence service , the bnd , paid millions .
but now many have begun to ask : does the end justify the means ? investigators probing the scale of tax evasion by germans have already uncovered some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in funds stashed in trusts in liechtenstein - and that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
by the time investigators have finished , the 4.2 million euros paid to an informant alleged to have stolen client data from liechtenstein 's lgt bank in 2002 will look like a bargain-basement price in comparison with the vast sums reclaimed by the german finance ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the data bought by the bnd was reportedly stolen from the lgt group in 2002 despite this , the whole affair is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many ordinary germans as well as politicians who take issue with the methods used by the government to obtain the liechtenstein bank data .
a poll showed that 52 percent of voters think the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- should not have paid for the information , while just 41 percent think the payment was justified .
" ordinary germans feel a certain solidarity with the people who are now being investigated for tax evasion , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university .
" on some level , this is something everyone in germany tries to do , whether that involves writing off bigger sums in your tax declaration than you should , getting paid for work that you do n't declare or paying someone to work under the table for you , " he added .
" these people also do n't want to be caught , and so they have something against the government using such methods to pursue tax evaders . "
a great deal or a criminal act ?
the bnd normally has nothing to do with tax matters , but officials say it was offered the information and only acted on it after consulting the government and tax authorities .
a notarized contract for the sum paid to the informant was drawn up , and detailed records were kept every step of the way .
according to finance ministry officials , there 's no doubt that the data will be admissible in court .
finance minister peer steinbrück said he did n't want to imagine the " wave of indignation that would roll through the country " if the bnd had acted any differently .
but ferdinand von schirach , one of two lawyers who have said so far that they plan to sue the german state for its handling of the affair , said the government can not use taxpayers ' money to reward criminal acts - such as the stealing of confidential bank information .
" even though it seems like a great deal … a crime can not be committed , " he told reuters tv .
" if that was the case , the state would be no better than any criminal on the street . "
bnd must answer to parliamentary committee last week , the bnd was asked to brief a parliamentary committee on its methods so that the government could decide whether to approve or disapprove of the liechtenstein operation , but members of the parliamentary intelligence committee deemed more documents were needed .
the next briefing is set for march 5 .
speaking to the berlin-based newspaper , taz , following the initial briefing , green party parliamentarian christian ströbele stressed the need for rule of law , even when it comes to hunting down tax evaders .
" putting aside my joy that the right people are finally being targeted , the law has to be followed here , even against our richest citizens , " ströbele said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neskovic : bnd 's behavior is " clearly illegal " left party parliamentarian wolfgang neskovic was more critical .
" the bnd 's behavior is , in my view , clearly illegal , " he said .
but neskovic doubts whether the parliamentary session on march 5 will lead to any consequences for the intelligence agency .
" in this republic , there are unchecked zones , especially when it comes to the intelligence service , and this has to change , " said neskovic , a former federal court justice .
" what we know of up to now is just a drop , and what we do n't know amounts to an ocean . "
liechtenstein furious over german tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince alois says germany is attacking his nation the acting head of liechtenstein , hereditary prince alois , has described the bnd 's behavior as " highly suspect . "
he said the informant , who has been identified as former lgt bank employee heinrich kieber , had been convicted of stealing bank data in 2002 and imprisoned .
" obviously , germany wants to be a big-time receiver of stolen goods , " he said , also making thinly veiled references to germany 's past aggression in europe .
" we are also a sovereign state and - we hope - do not live in an era where might makes right . "
contributing to the war of words that 's been started with the tiny alpine state , german chancellor angela merkel accused liechtenstein 's banks of " encouraging lawbreaking , " and said that it and other tax havens should " mend their ways " or face the consequences .
swiss banks suspicious of espionage one of the consequences already emerging from the bnd 's liechtenstein operation is that germans applying for jobs at swiss banks will undergo additional scrutiny in future because of espionage concerns .
the thousands of germans already working in switzerland 's financial industry could also feel the effects of the german government 's crackdown .
the head of switzerland 's private banker 's association , michel derobert , said the methods used by the bnd to obtain the secret banking data from liechtenstein were " reprehensible " and would lead to extra precautions in switzerland to protect client privacy .

the eu hopes other power companies will follow eon 's lead . the eu 's executive body said on thursday , feb .
28 , that it would check whether the move by eon will end the company 's antitrust problems .
the european commission has been trying for years to push energy companies to divest their grids in order to increase competition in the electricity and gas market and make prices more consumer-friendly . eu leaders agreed last year to separate power production from distribution networks .
the commission favors complete " ownership unbundling " or having an independent company to run pipelines and energy grids , but a group of eight countries , led by france and germany , was pursuing an alternative to avoid the break-up of their vertically integrated utilities . eon 's announcement on thursday came as a complete turnaround . " eon proposes to commit to sell its electricity transmission system network to an operator which would have no interest in the electricity generation and / or supply business , " the european commission said in a statement . move could end antitrust inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels will now check whether it antitrust proceedings against eon can be dropped eu economics ministers were meeting in brussels on thursday to discuss ways of increasing competition in the gas and power sector .
eu energy commissioner andris pielbalgs welcomed eon 's decision , adding that he hoped other companies would act in a similar fashion . wulf bernotat , chief executive of eon , had discussed the possible sale with german chancellor angela merkel , a government spokesperson said .
still , the news is likely to have come as a surprise , as the german government had made a point of lobbying in brussels for the company to avoid such a sell-off . the company has also promised to divest 4,800 megawatts of generation capacity to rivals .
brussels said it would ask eon 's customers and competitors for their views on the proposal , and would close the antitrust cases once a legally binding decision was made . eu aims to lower prices the eu 's investigations concerned problems in the power sector where , according to brussels , former state-run monopolies had too much control over the supply chain , keeping prices high and limiting much-needed investment to expand capacity . " we have been aware for some time that eon but also rwe and vattenfall are in close touch with investment banks to sell their grids , " claude turmes , a member of the european parliament 's energy committee for the greens group , told reuters .
" this is a tipping point in the debate . " rwe , germany 's second-largest utility , said it was not going to sell its grid . a spokesman for vattenfall europe , a swedish-based company that is vertically integrated in germany , confirmed that it was looking at alternative ownership structures for its german transmission network . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government 's crackdown on tax evaders comes courtesy of stolen bank data , for which germany 's intelligence service , the bnd , paid millions .
but now many have begun to ask : does the end justify the means ? investigators probing the scale of tax evasion by germans have already uncovered some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in funds stashed in trusts in liechtenstein - and that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
by the time investigators have finished , the 4.2 million euros paid to an informant alleged to have stolen client data from liechtenstein 's lgt bank in 2002 will look like a bargain-basement price in comparison with the vast sums reclaimed by the german finance ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the data bought by the bnd was reportedly stolen from the lgt group in 2002 despite this , the whole affair is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many ordinary germans as well as politicians who take issue with the methods used by the government to obtain the liechtenstein bank data .
a poll showed that 52 percent of voters think the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- should not have paid for the information , while just 41 percent think the payment was justified .
" ordinary germans feel a certain solidarity with the people who are now being investigated for tax evasion , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university .
" on some level , this is something everyone in germany tries to do , whether that involves writing off bigger sums in your tax declaration than you should , getting paid for work that you do n't declare or paying someone to work under the table for you , " he added .
" these people also do n't want to be caught , and so they have something against the government using such methods to pursue tax evaders . "
a great deal or a criminal act ?
the bnd normally has nothing to do with tax matters , but officials say it was offered the information and only acted on it after consulting the government and tax authorities .
a notarized contract for the sum paid to the informant was drawn up , and detailed records were kept every step of the way .
according to finance ministry officials , there 's no doubt that the data will be admissible in court .
finance minister peer steinbrück said he did n't want to imagine the " wave of indignation that would roll through the country " if the bnd had acted any differently .
but ferdinand von schirach , one of two lawyers who have said so far that they plan to sue the german state for its handling of the affair , said the government can not use taxpayers ' money to reward criminal acts - such as the stealing of confidential bank information .
" even though it seems like a great deal … a crime can not be committed , " he told reuters tv .
" if that was the case , the state would be no better than any criminal on the street . "
bnd must answer to parliamentary committee last week , the bnd was asked to brief a parliamentary committee on its methods so that the government could decide whether to approve or disapprove of the liechtenstein operation , but members of the parliamentary intelligence committee deemed more documents were needed .
the next briefing is set for march 5 .
speaking to the berlin-based newspaper , taz , following the initial briefing , green party parliamentarian christian ströbele stressed the need for rule of law , even when it comes to hunting down tax evaders .
" putting aside my joy that the right people are finally being targeted , the law has to be followed here , even against our richest citizens , " ströbele said .

he said the informant , who has been identified as former lgt bank employee heinrich kieber , had been convicted of stealing bank data in 2002 and imprisoned .
" obviously , germany wants to be a big-time receiver of stolen goods , " he said , also making thinly veiled references to germany 's past aggression in europe .
" we are also a sovereign state and - we hope - do not live in an era where might makes right . "
contributing to the war of words that 's been started with the tiny alpine state , german chancellor angela merkel accused liechtenstein 's banks of " encouraging lawbreaking , " and said that it and other tax havens should " mend their ways " or face the consequences .
swiss banks suspicious of espionage one of the consequences already emerging from the bnd 's liechtenstein operation is that germans applying for jobs at swiss banks will undergo additional scrutiny in future because of espionage concerns .

the german government 's crackdown on tax evaders comes courtesy of stolen bank data , for which germany 's intelligence service , the bnd , paid millions .
but now many have begun to ask : does the end justify the means ? investigators probing the scale of tax evasion by germans have already uncovered some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in funds stashed in trusts in liechtenstein - and that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
by the time investigators have finished , the 4.2 million euros paid to an informant alleged to have stolen client data from liechtenstein 's lgt bank in 2002 will look like a bargain-basement price in comparison with the vast sums reclaimed by the german finance ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the data bought by the bnd was reportedly stolen from the lgt group in 2002 despite this , the whole affair is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many ordinary germans as well as politicians who take issue with the methods used by the government to obtain the liechtenstein bank data .
a poll showed that 52 percent of voters think the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- should not have paid for the information , while just 41 percent think the payment was justified .
" ordinary germans feel a certain solidarity with the people who are now being investigated for tax evasion , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university .
" on some level , this is something everyone in germany tries to do , whether that involves writing off bigger sums in your tax declaration than you should , getting paid for work that you do n't declare or paying someone to work under the table for you , " he added .
" these people also do n't want to be caught , and so they have something against the government using such methods to pursue tax evaders . "
a great deal or a criminal act ?
the bnd normally has nothing to do with tax matters , but officials say it was offered the information and only acted on it after consulting the government and tax authorities .
a notarized contract for the sum paid to the informant was drawn up , and detailed records were kept every step of the way .
according to finance ministry officials , there 's no doubt that the data will be admissible in court .
finance minister peer steinbrück said he did n't want to imagine the " wave of indignation that would roll through the country " if the bnd had acted any differently .
but ferdinand von schirach , one of two lawyers who have said so far that they plan to sue the german state for its handling of the affair , said the government can not use taxpayers ' money to reward criminal acts - such as the stealing of confidential bank information .
" even though it seems like a great deal … a crime can not be committed , " he told reuters tv .
" if that was the case , the state would be no better than any criminal on the street . "
bnd must answer to parliamentary committee last week , the bnd was asked to brief a parliamentary committee on its methods so that the government could decide whether to approve or disapprove of the liechtenstein operation , but members of the parliamentary intelligence committee deemed more documents were needed .

eu leaders want it to lead to more cooperation fighting tax evasion as well . liechtenstein prime minister otmar hasler on thursday , feb .
28 , welcomed an accord opening the way for his nation to enter europe 's open borders area , telling afp news agency it would be " an important step for integration and cooperation on fiscal matters . " the first-step accord to allow liechtenstein in the 24-nation schengen bloc came despite a tax fraud row with germany , which had threatened to block the move .
the tiny alpine principality has been accused of encouraging tax fraud with its lax fiscal code . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is among three osce-recognized tax havens an eu official told afp that " the subject passed without any debate " at a meeting of european union interior and justice ministers in brussels . the european justice and security commissioner franco frattini said the tax evasion investigations involving liechtenstein should not prevent the country from entering the visa-free travel zone . " -lsb- it -rsb- is very important to get liechtenstein in the schengen area , it is simply not possible to have an enclave in the center of europe , " frattini said before the signing ceremony . awaiting ratification the exact date of liechtenstein 's entry into the schengen area has not yet been set , but it has been closely tied to the adhesion of its bigger neighbor switzerland , which is due to join by november . the protocol allowing liechtenstein to implement schengen rules still needs to be ratified by all 27 eu nations , which could present an opportunity for one of them to use schengen to gain leverage over it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : problems could arise from a borderless tax haven germany spearheaded the crackdown on tax havens amid suspicions that hundreds of rich germans evaded taxes by parking money in liechtenstein banks .
despite this , however , germany has opted against vetoing the principality 's entry into the schengen agreement . asked if germany would hold off on approving liechtenstein 's accession to the european border-free area , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told reporters , " in principle we are willing to ratify it , but there have been talks -lsb- on combating fraud -rsb- , and they have to show some effect . " in addition to germany , investigators in the united states , britain , australia , italy , france , sweden , canada , new zealand , greece and spain are among the countries now hunting for nationals hiding their money in liechtenstein . currently on the blacklist hasler said his country is now seeking a " reasonable " tax fraud deal with the eu . " with respect to the current tax policy questions that are broadly and controversially debated in europe , we want to play our part in finding a reasonable agreement , " hasler told reuters news service .

in january , a court in the northern state of schleswig-holstein reached a similar conclusion , saying swedish energy company vattenfall could not transfer energy output from muehlheim-kaerlich , where it also has a power plant , to a power plant in brunsbüttel . each nuclear power plant 's remaining operational time is measured in terms of the amount of power it is allowed to generate .
a 2002 law governing germany 's plans to eliminate nuclear power only allows a company to transfer energy output from one plant to another in very specific cases . utilities vs. public opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-nuke activists say it is a greener energy alternative rwe had asked to transfer the allowance to produce 30 terawatt hours of electricity from muehlheim-kaerlich to biblis a. without the transfer the biblis a plant would run until about september 2009 .
had it been approved , the transfer would have kept the biblis a plant open through federal elections in 2009 . rwe said wednesday , feb .
27 , that it planned to appeal the verdict at the federal administrative court . german utilities - including e.on , the world 's largest utility by sales - are battling public opinion and politicians to change an agreement with the government under which they have to shut all their nuclear power plants by the early 2020s . hoping for shift in political winds they want to use their profitable nuclear power stations for several years longer , and hope that a possible change in the country 's political makeup could lead to a reversal of the decision to eliminate nuclear power . utilities argue that nuclear power produces less carbon dioxide , a gas causing global warming , and would help keep power prices down , as fuels such as coal have climbed to record highs . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

apart from irritating the french , he 's been ruffling feathers abroad - most recently in berlin . scheduling difficulties - this diplomatic euphemism was the official reason from paris for letting two franco-german meetings slip through the cracks this week . french finance minister christine lagarde should have been received by her german counterpart , peer steinbrueck , on tuesday , feb .
26 , but le president had something else in mind : he took the minister on a trip to visit businesses in the countryside .
after all , local elections take place on march 9 and 16 , so bilateral relations apparently have to take a backseat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are n't quite so amicable right now several days ago , sarkozy postponed a march 3 meeting with chancellor angela merkel by three months .
the unofficial summit had been planned far in advance . " club med " concerns chancellor at the diplomatic level , the cancellations are brushed off as inconsequential .
but it 's no a secret that ties between paris and berlin are n't exactly close .
the german chancellor is still disgruntled about sarkozy 's mediterranean union initative .
originally conceived as a kind of consolation prize for turkey , which sarkozy does n't want in the eu , it 's become a serious project for the french president . germany , however , is worried that france is splitting the eu and looking to take a leadership role in europe .
and sarkozy 's invitation to the mediterranean heads of state to visit paris on july 13 - one day before the rest of the eu heads of state arrive to celebrate france taking over the eu presidency - did nothing to dispel concerns . berlin is not alone in its irritation with the french president , who took office in may last year . broken promises , tactless plans in january of this year , he promised french fishermen that he would do away with fishing quotas when his country assumes the eu presidency on july 1 .
but just a few weeks earlier , france had signed a fishing regulation law .
agriculture minister michel barnier was hard-pressed to calm the ensuing storm of protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france does n't want turkey in the eu but suggested an association treaty for ukraine in early february , eu commission president jose manuel barroso reprimanded the french government for not making enough of an effort to economize . also at the beginning of the month , french diplomats came up with the idea of an association treaty with ukraine at a time when , according to the german weekly die zeit , speculations over an eastward eu expansion are taboo . what 's more , french-speakers in switzerland , canada and belgium are furious that sarkozy wants to integrate broadcaster tv 5 monde in a purely french holding company .
the partner countries own a one-third share in the francophone broadcaster . distracted by local campaign but any judgements on sarkozy 's foreign policy should take into account that he 's under significant pressure abroad , said the director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg , frank baasner . " there are just a few weeks until the local elections , " said baasner .
" if his party suffers a setback , his popularity will be completely lost . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france takes over the eu presidency in july " france 's foreign policy is domestic policy , for the time being . " in de gaulle 's footsteps sarkozy is not the first president to be accused of going it alone or displaying his omnipotence .

apart from irritating the french , he 's been ruffling feathers abroad - most recently in berlin . scheduling difficulties - this diplomatic euphemism was the official reason from paris for letting two franco-german meetings slip through the cracks this week . french finance minister christine lagarde should have been received by her german counterpart , peer steinbrueck , on tuesday , feb .
26 , but le president had something else in mind : he took the minister on a trip to visit businesses in the countryside .
after all , local elections take place on march 9 and 16 , so bilateral relations apparently have to take a backseat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are n't quite so amicable right now several days ago , sarkozy postponed a march 3 meeting with chancellor angela merkel by three months .
the unofficial summit had been planned far in advance . " club med " concerns chancellor at the diplomatic level , the cancellations are brushed off as inconsequential .
but it 's no a secret that ties between paris and berlin are n't exactly close .
the german chancellor is still disgruntled about sarkozy 's mediterranean union initative .
originally conceived as a kind of consolation prize for turkey , which sarkozy does n't want in the eu , it 's become a serious project for the french president . germany , however , is worried that france is splitting the eu and looking to take a leadership role in europe .
and sarkozy 's invitation to the mediterranean heads of state to visit paris on july 13 - one day before the rest of the eu heads of state arrive to celebrate france taking over the eu presidency - did nothing to dispel concerns . berlin is not alone in its irritation with the french president , who took office in may last year . broken promises , tactless plans in january of this year , he promised french fishermen that he would do away with fishing quotas when his country assumes the eu presidency on july 1 .
but just a few weeks earlier , france had signed a fishing regulation law .
agriculture minister michel barnier was hard-pressed to calm the ensuing storm of protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france does n't want turkey in the eu but suggested an association treaty for ukraine in early february , eu commission president jose manuel barroso reprimanded the french government for not making enough of an effort to economize . also at the beginning of the month , french diplomats came up with the idea of an association treaty with ukraine at a time when , according to the german weekly die zeit , speculations over an eastward eu expansion are taboo . what 's more , french-speakers in switzerland , canada and belgium are furious that sarkozy wants to integrate broadcaster tv 5 monde in a purely french holding company .
the partner countries own a one-third share in the francophone broadcaster . distracted by local campaign but any judgements on sarkozy 's foreign policy should take into account that he 's under significant pressure abroad , said the director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg , frank baasner . " there are just a few weeks until the local elections , " said baasner .
" if his party suffers a setback , his popularity will be completely lost . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france takes over the eu presidency in july " france 's foreign policy is domestic policy , for the time being . " in de gaulle 's footsteps sarkozy is not the first president to be accused of going it alone or displaying his omnipotence .
charles de gaulle , the resistance general and post-war president made france into a nuclear power independent of the united states .
in 1962 , he called for a " europe of fatherlands " led by france . baasner pointed to the continuity between de gaulle and sarkozy .
the idea that europe is an extension of france is deeply rooted in the french consciousness , he said . but france 's current president also has his own style , said baasner .
" what surprises even the french is the coolness , the near aggressiveness of his style . " that aggressiveness was most recently on display earlier this week when , during a visit to a paris agricultural fair , sarkozy insulted a bystander who refused to shake his hand , telling the man to " get lost , " followed by some choice french expletives . nevertheless , many european leaders have had to go through crises before finally becoming grounded .
sarkozy - and france - may just have to prepare for a process of refinement " through the power of reality , " baasner said . andreas leixnering -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in january , a court in the northern state of schleswig-holstein reached a similar conclusion , saying swedish energy company vattenfall could not transfer energy output from muehlheim-kaerlich , where it also has a power plant , to a power plant in brunsbüttel . each nuclear power plant 's remaining operational time is measured in terms of the amount of power it is allowed to generate .
a 2002 law governing germany 's plans to eliminate nuclear power only allows a company to transfer energy output from one plant to another in very specific cases . utilities vs. public opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-nuke activists say it is a greener energy alternative rwe had asked to transfer the allowance to produce 30 terawatt hours of electricity from muehlheim-kaerlich to biblis a. without the transfer the biblis a plant would run until about september 2009 .
had it been approved , the transfer would have kept the biblis a plant open through federal elections in 2009 . rwe said wednesday , feb .
27 , that it planned to appeal the verdict at the federal administrative court . german utilities - including e.on , the world 's largest utility by sales - are battling public opinion and politicians to change an agreement with the government under which they have to shut all their nuclear power plants by the early 2020s . hoping for shift in political winds they want to use their profitable nuclear power stations for several years longer , and hope that a possible change in the country 's political makeup could lead to a reversal of the decision to eliminate nuclear power . utilities argue that nuclear power produces less carbon dioxide , a gas causing global warming , and would help keep power prices down , as fuels such as coal have climbed to record highs . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

basic rights are n't disposable , says dw 's daphne antachopoulos . the court decision follows the same guideline as many other verdicts from the constitutional court in karlsruhe : security laws may not undermine basic rights . the judges reached a similar conclusion in deciding whether to allow authorities to bug private apartments or shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked by terrorists .
human and civil rights take precedence over the nearly insatiable need for security cultivated by some politicians . the now invalid law in north rhine-westphalia had allowed authorities to access a suspect 's hard drive and keep it under regular surveillance - under the condition that they expected to find evidence of anti-constitutional activity . such a massive intrusion should not be possible on such vague grounds , the karlsruhe court decided .
rather , the state may secretly spy on someone only if there is strong evidence that personal safety , lives , freedom , state property or the foundation of human existence are endangered .
and only with permission from a judge . those are high hurdles .
and that 's how they should be . it was n't a coincidence that court president hans-juergen papier said the decision had implications beyond the case in north rhine-westphalia .
his words were directed at interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who is planning a federal law allowing for online surveillance of crime suspects . schaeuble 's credo is that the threat of terrorism is omnipresent , invisible and incalculable .
therefore , the state should take such measures in order to prevent this danger .
according to schaeuble , all surveillance and combat instruments should be able to be used even in fully abstract situations of danger . fortunately , karlsruhe clamped down first .
basic rights are n't disposable regardless of the need for security .
the criteria for state action must be very concretely defined , particularly when a basic right is so massively intruded upon .
innocent people should not be targeted by the state with such sweeping , preventive blows . wednesday 's court decision recalled yet another axiom : not only do we need protection by the state but also from the state . if every citizen is treated like a potential terrorist and his or her private sphere is monitored , the state will have a hard time convincing its citizens that it also wants to protect them . wolfgang schaeuble said he will take the court decision into account .
the question remains why these kinds of issues always have to be resolved in karlsruhe and not first in berlin . it seems as if politicians responsible for security always want to test the boundaries - and the constitutional court is then forced to draw the line . daphne antachopoulos is a reporter for deutsche welle specializing in german domestic and foreign policy . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

basic rights are n't disposable , says dw 's daphne antachopoulos . the court decision follows the same guideline as many other verdicts from the constitutional court in karlsruhe : security laws may not undermine basic rights . the judges reached a similar conclusion in deciding whether to allow authorities to bug private apartments or shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked by terrorists .
human and civil rights take precedence over the nearly insatiable need for security cultivated by some politicians . the now invalid law in north rhine-westphalia had allowed authorities to access a suspect 's hard drive and keep it under regular surveillance - under the condition that they expected to find evidence of anti-constitutional activity . such a massive intrusion should not be possible on such vague grounds , the karlsruhe court decided .
rather , the state may secretly spy on someone only if there is strong evidence that personal safety , lives , freedom , state property or the foundation of human existence are endangered .
and only with permission from a judge . those are high hurdles .
and that 's how they should be . it was n't a coincidence that court president hans-juergen papier said the decision had implications beyond the case in north rhine-westphalia .
his words were directed at interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who is planning a federal law allowing for online surveillance of crime suspects . schaeuble 's credo is that the threat of terrorism is omnipresent , invisible and incalculable .
therefore , the state should take such measures in order to prevent this danger .
according to schaeuble , all surveillance and combat instruments should be able to be used even in fully abstract situations of danger . fortunately , karlsruhe clamped down first .
basic rights are n't disposable regardless of the need for security .
the criteria for state action must be very concretely defined , particularly when a basic right is so massively intruded upon .
innocent people should not be targeted by the state with such sweeping , preventive blows . wednesday 's court decision recalled yet another axiom : not only do we need protection by the state but also from the state . if every citizen is treated like a potential terrorist and his or her private sphere is monitored , the state will have a hard time convincing its citizens that it also wants to protect them . wolfgang schaeuble said he will take the court decision into account .
the question remains why these kinds of issues always have to be resolved in karlsruhe and not first in berlin . it seems as if politicians responsible for security always want to test the boundaries - and the constitutional court is then forced to draw the line . daphne antachopoulos is a reporter for deutsche welle specializing in german domestic and foreign policy . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" compromise was necessary for the survival of this country ... they kept the future of kenya always in their sights and reached a common position for the good of the nation .

" this is a particularly important agreement that will enable kenya to return to stability and prosperity and will also have a positive impact throughout the region , " solana said in a statement . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also welcomed thursday 's deal . " kenya has grasped the opportunity to resolve its political crisis peacefully and to return to stability , " he said . in order to help the new government to its feet , british prime minister gordon brown said he would sponsor a donor summit to provide aid to kenya . " we 'd be prepared in london to host a donors conference to make sure kenya has the best chance to build upon this power-sharing agreement , to restore tourism -lrb- and -rrb- get the economy moving again , " he told reporters after speaking to annan . ethnic clashes resulted from disputed election bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism in kenya drastically dropped when violence broke out kibaki 's disputed reelection on dec .

" as a nation , there are more issues that unite than divide us , " said kibaki after the signing .
" we 've been reminded that we must do all in our power to safeguard the peace that is the foundation of our national unity .

the eu hopes other power companies will follow eon 's lead . the eu 's executive body said on thursday , feb .
28 , that it would check whether the move by eon will end the company 's antitrust problems .
the european commission has been trying for years to push energy companies to divest their grids in order to increase competition in the electricity and gas market and make prices more consumer-friendly . eu leaders agreed last year to separate power production from distribution networks .
the commission favors complete " ownership unbundling " or having an independent company to run pipelines and energy grids , but a group of eight countries , led by france and germany , was pursuing an alternative to avoid the break-up of their vertically integrated utilities . eon 's announcement on thursday came as a complete turnaround . " eon proposes to commit to sell its electricity transmission system network to an operator which would have no interest in the electricity generation and / or supply business , " the european commission said in a statement . move could end antitrust inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels will now check whether it antitrust proceedings against eon can be dropped eu economics ministers were meeting in brussels on thursday to discuss ways of increasing competition in the gas and power sector .
eu energy commissioner andris pielbalgs welcomed eon 's decision , adding that he hoped other companies would act in a similar fashion . wulf bernotat , chief executive of eon , had discussed the possible sale with german chancellor angela merkel , a government spokesperson said .
still , the news is likely to have come as a surprise , as the german government had made a point of lobbying in brussels for the company to avoid such a sell-off . the company has also promised to divest 4,800 megawatts of generation capacity to rivals .
brussels said it would ask eon 's customers and competitors for their views on the proposal , and would close the antitrust cases once a legally binding decision was made . eu aims to lower prices the eu 's investigations concerned problems in the power sector where , according to brussels , former state-run monopolies had too much control over the supply chain , keeping prices high and limiting much-needed investment to expand capacity . " we have been aware for some time that eon but also rwe and vattenfall are in close touch with investment banks to sell their grids , " claude turmes , a member of the european parliament 's energy committee for the greens group , told reuters .
" this is a tipping point in the debate .

not the first in the area , the sale suggests the district has failed to become the thriving commercial center the city intended . sony said thursday , feb .
28 , that as part of its streamlining efforts , it would be selling the berlin sony center to a group of german and us investment funds , including investment bank morgan stanley , corpus sireo and an affiliate of the john buck company . the sprawling entertainment complex in the center of the german capital houses offices , stores , restaurants and a cinema and attracts over 8 million visitors a year .
but the company now says it plans to focus on core business areas such as electronics . the sony companies located on the premises will remain tenants , and the center will keep the group 's name , it said in a statement .
the sale is expected to be completed by the end of next month subject to regulatory approval . financial loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what does the future hold for potsdamer platz ?
the move is not entirely unexpected .
in 2006 , the iconic japanese company 's first foreign head , howard stringer , announced 10,000 job cuts and plans for a swathe of asset disposals in an effort to revive its flagging fortunes . the company did not divulge the value of the deal but said the expected profits had already been factored into its earlier forecast for a 471 percent surge in operating profit to 410 billion yen -lrb- $ 3.8 billion , 2.5 billion euros -rrb- in the current fiscal year to march . insiders say sony will be paid less than 600 million euros for the building that originally cost the japanese company 750 million euros in the late 1990s . a failed vision for the capital one of the most ambitious development projects in post-reunification germany , the spectacular domed building designed by architect helmut jahn first opened in june 2000 . it was hailed as a symbol of the new , reunited berlin .
but along with other real estate on potsdamer platz - such as the 19 buildings making up the daimler " quartier , " which sold to the swedish banking group seb last december for an estimated 1.2 billion euros - it failed to help turn the neighborhood into the capital 's new commercial district . to many , the sale will confirm suspicions of waning confidence in the potsdamer platz project - especially given that sony was allegedly unable to find a buyer willing to pay its initial asking price of 800 million euros . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not the first in the area , the sale suggests the district has failed to become the thriving commercial center the city intended . sony said thursday , feb .
28 , that as part of its streamlining efforts , it would be selling the berlin sony center to a group of german and us investment funds , including investment bank morgan stanley , corpus sireo and an affiliate of the john buck company . the sprawling entertainment complex in the center of the german capital houses offices , stores , restaurants and a cinema and attracts over 8 million visitors a year .
but the company now says it plans to focus on core business areas such as electronics . the sony companies located on the premises will remain tenants , and the center will keep the group 's name , it said in a statement .
the sale is expected to be completed by the end of next month subject to regulatory approval . financial loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what does the future hold for potsdamer platz ?
the move is not entirely unexpected .
in 2006 , the iconic japanese company 's first foreign head , howard stringer , announced 10,000 job cuts and plans for a swathe of asset disposals in an effort to revive its flagging fortunes . the company did not divulge the value of the deal but said the expected profits had already been factored into its earlier forecast for a 471 percent surge in operating profit to 410 billion yen -lrb- $ 3.8 billion , 2.5 billion euros -rrb- in the current fiscal year to march . insiders say sony will be paid less than 600 million euros for the building that originally cost the japanese company 750 million euros in the late 1990s . a failed vision for the capital one of the most ambitious development projects in post-reunification germany , the spectacular domed building designed by architect helmut jahn first opened in june 2000 . it was hailed as a symbol of the new , reunited berlin .
but along with other real estate on potsdamer platz - such as the 19 buildings making up the daimler " quartier , " which sold to the swedish banking group seb last december for an estimated 1.2 billion euros - it failed to help turn the neighborhood into the capital 's new commercial district . to many , the sale will confirm suspicions of waning confidence in the potsdamer platz project - especially given that sony was allegedly unable to find a buyer willing to pay its initial asking price of 800 million euros . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those two went on to become the last german administration 's foreign and interior ministers . until now , however , no one ever suspected that chancellor angela merkel boasts equally street-smart credentials . a woman who looks as though she would n't even risk jaywalking , merkel revealed in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's magazine to be published friday , feb .
28 , that as a veteran of the infamous berlin squat scene , she too once enjoyed a spell on society 's margins . during her 20s , she explained , she lived illegally in an apartment in the district of mitte , a now gentrified neighborhood in the heart of what was once communist east berlin . apparently , she had struggled to find accommodation when she moved to berlin from leipzig with her first husband in 1978 to work in a science institute .

some government officials and renewable energy experts say he 's needlessly spreading panic . power outages are a common occurrence not just in developing countries .

" power is growing short all over europe because there are not enough power stations , " grossmann told the bild newspaper .
" right now , all we need is the combination of a hot , dry summer and the shutdown of more power stations for maintenance for power security to be endangered .

" all the figures show that there is no reason to speak of an energy gap , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one expert said there 's no reason for germans to stock up on candles schroeren added that while it is true that energy production can be restricted during periods of very hot weather , german citizens generally do not feel the effects . the federal association for hydropower and energy -lrb- bdew -rrb- said that " potential shortages could be the result if many negative factors were to come together at once . " germany 's renewable energy branch reacted with scorn to grossmann 's comments .
the head of the federal association for renewable energy -lrb- bee -rrb- , milan nitzschke , said there are no energy gaps in germany . " this is pure fear-mongering , " he added . competing interests in german " energy mix " there has been ongoing debate in germany about the country 's optimal " energy mix . " germany has committed to a total phase-out of nuclear power by 2020 and to increasing the proportion of energy that comes from renewable sources .
chancellor angela merkel , however , has spoken out for an energy mix that includes nuclear power , as well as more energy generated by coal-fired power stations . merkel 's government plans to build up to 25 new coal-fired plants in order to fill the gap left when nuclear plants are taken offline .

family affairs minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the decision , saying it showed the government was facing up to its responsibilites .
" we can not overvalue the extraordinary achievements of thalidomide victims , who have fought for success in their professional and private lives , " she said .
" they deserve society 's respect . "
" i am also confident that the government can cooperate with the gruenenthal company to develop a plan for further benefits to thalidomide victims , " she added . " talks begun in 2007 on how to improve their situation have been promising . "
extra help needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drug claimed 10,000 victims all over the world the move came after a public outcry against germany 's limited help for aging thalidomide victims .
around 10,000 babies around the world were born with disabilities as a result of their mothers taking the drug , marketed in germany under the brand name contergan . just under half of those survived .
others learned to live with disabilities such as extremely shortened or missing limbs , or missing organs .
the over-the-counter remedy was taken off the market four years after its launch and better drug regulation introduced round the globe .
but 50 years on , the victims are now middle-aged .
with their parents dying off , they need extra help to relieve sore joints and compensate for a life of poor earnings .
currently the 2,870 victims in germany receive a stipend of up to 545 euros monthly , depending on their degree of disability , from a trust fund set up by gruenenthal and the german government .
the pharmaceuticals company paid 100 million deutsche marks -lrb- 51.13 million euros -rrb- into the compensation fund in 1971 after a criminal trial following thalidomide 's withdrawal , but has not provided any additional support for the fund since ..
german victims have demanded a tripling of the stipend , saying victims in britain and elsewhere were compensated better .

the german government 's crackdown on tax evaders comes courtesy of stolen bank data , for which germany 's intelligence service , the bnd , paid millions .
but now many have begun to ask : does the end justify the means ? investigators probing the scale of tax evasion by germans have already uncovered some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in funds stashed in trusts in liechtenstein - and that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
by the time investigators have finished , the 4.2 million euros paid to an informant alleged to have stolen client data from liechtenstein 's lgt bank in 2002 will look like a bargain-basement price in comparison with the vast sums reclaimed by the german finance ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the data bought by the bnd was reportedly stolen from the lgt group in 2002 despite this , the whole affair is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many ordinary germans as well as politicians who take issue with the methods used by the government to obtain the liechtenstein bank data .
a poll showed that 52 percent of voters think the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- should not have paid for the information , while just 41 percent think the payment was justified .
" ordinary germans feel a certain solidarity with the people who are now being investigated for tax evasion , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university .
" on some level , this is something everyone in germany tries to do , whether that involves writing off bigger sums in your tax declaration than you should , getting paid for work that you do n't declare or paying someone to work under the table for you , " he added .
" these people also do n't want to be caught , and so they have something against the government using such methods to pursue tax evaders . "
a great deal or a criminal act ?
the bnd normally has nothing to do with tax matters , but officials say it was offered the information and only acted on it after consulting the government and tax authorities .
a notarized contract for the sum paid to the informant was drawn up , and detailed records were kept every step of the way .
according to finance ministry officials , there 's no doubt that the data will be admissible in court .
finance minister peer steinbrück said he did n't want to imagine the " wave of indignation that would roll through the country " if the bnd had acted any differently .

" even though it seems like a great deal … a crime can not be committed , " he told reuters tv .
" if that was the case , the state would be no better than any criminal on the street . "
bnd must answer to parliamentary committee last week , the bnd was asked to brief a parliamentary committee on its methods so that the government could decide whether to approve or disapprove of the liechtenstein operation , but members of the parliamentary intelligence committee deemed more documents were needed .

the german government 's crackdown on tax evaders comes courtesy of stolen bank data , for which germany 's intelligence service , the bnd , paid millions .
but now many have begun to ask : does the end justify the means ? investigators probing the scale of tax evasion by germans have already uncovered some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in funds stashed in trusts in liechtenstein - and that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
by the time investigators have finished , the 4.2 million euros paid to an informant alleged to have stolen client data from liechtenstein 's lgt bank in 2002 will look like a bargain-basement price in comparison with the vast sums reclaimed by the german finance ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the data bought by the bnd was reportedly stolen from the lgt group in 2002 despite this , the whole affair is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many ordinary germans as well as politicians who take issue with the methods used by the government to obtain the liechtenstein bank data .
a poll showed that 52 percent of voters think the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- should not have paid for the information , while just 41 percent think the payment was justified .
" ordinary germans feel a certain solidarity with the people who are now being investigated for tax evasion , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university .
" on some level , this is something everyone in germany tries to do , whether that involves writing off bigger sums in your tax declaration than you should , getting paid for work that you do n't declare or paying someone to work under the table for you , " he added .
" these people also do n't want to be caught , and so they have something against the government using such methods to pursue tax evaders . "
a great deal or a criminal act ?
the bnd normally has nothing to do with tax matters , but officials say it was offered the information and only acted on it after consulting the government and tax authorities .
a notarized contract for the sum paid to the informant was drawn up , and detailed records were kept every step of the way .
according to finance ministry officials , there 's no doubt that the data will be admissible in court .
finance minister peer steinbrück said he did n't want to imagine the " wave of indignation that would roll through the country " if the bnd had acted any differently .
but ferdinand von schirach , one of two lawyers who have said so far that they plan to sue the german state for its handling of the affair , said the government can not use taxpayers ' money to reward criminal acts - such as the stealing of confidential bank information .
" even though it seems like a great deal … a crime can not be committed , " he told reuters tv .
" if that was the case , the state would be no better than any criminal on the street . "
bnd must answer to parliamentary committee last week , the bnd was asked to brief a parliamentary committee on its methods so that the government could decide whether to approve or disapprove of the liechtenstein operation , but members of the parliamentary intelligence committee deemed more documents were needed .
the next briefing is set for march 5 .
speaking to the berlin-based newspaper , taz , following the initial briefing , green party parliamentarian christian ströbele stressed the need for rule of law , even when it comes to hunting down tax evaders .
" putting aside my joy that the right people are finally being targeted , the law has to be followed here , even against our richest citizens , " ströbele said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neskovic : bnd 's behavior is " clearly illegal " left party parliamentarian wolfgang neskovic was more critical .
" the bnd 's behavior is , in my view , clearly illegal , " he said .
but neskovic doubts whether the parliamentary session on march 5 will lead to any consequences for the intelligence agency .
" in this republic , there are unchecked zones , especially when it comes to the intelligence service , and this has to change , " said neskovic , a former federal court justice .
" what we know of up to now is just a drop , and what we do n't know amounts to an ocean . "

" obviously , germany wants to be a big-time receiver of stolen goods , " he said , also making thinly veiled references to germany 's past aggression in europe .

apart from irritating the french , he 's been ruffling feathers abroad - most recently in berlin . scheduling difficulties - this diplomatic euphemism was the official reason from paris for letting two franco-german meetings slip through the cracks this week . french finance minister christine lagarde should have been received by her german counterpart , peer steinbrueck , on tuesday , feb .
26 , but le president had something else in mind : he took the minister on a trip to visit businesses in the countryside .
after all , local elections take place on march 9 and 16 , so bilateral relations apparently have to take a backseat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are n't quite so amicable right now several days ago , sarkozy postponed a march 3 meeting with chancellor angela merkel by three months .
the unofficial summit had been planned far in advance . " club med " concerns chancellor at the diplomatic level , the cancellations are brushed off as inconsequential .
but it 's no a secret that ties between paris and berlin are n't exactly close .
the german chancellor is still disgruntled about sarkozy 's mediterranean union initative .
originally conceived as a kind of consolation prize for turkey , which sarkozy does n't want in the eu , it 's become a serious project for the french president . germany , however , is worried that france is splitting the eu and looking to take a leadership role in europe .
and sarkozy 's invitation to the mediterranean heads of state to visit paris on july 13 - one day before the rest of the eu heads of state arrive to celebrate france taking over the eu presidency - did nothing to dispel concerns . berlin is not alone in its irritation with the french president , who took office in may last year . broken promises , tactless plans in january of this year , he promised french fishermen that he would do away with fishing quotas when his country assumes the eu presidency on july 1 .
but just a few weeks earlier , france had signed a fishing regulation law .
agriculture minister michel barnier was hard-pressed to calm the ensuing storm of protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france does n't want turkey in the eu but suggested an association treaty for ukraine in early february , eu commission president jose manuel barroso reprimanded the french government for not making enough of an effort to economize . also at the beginning of the month , french diplomats came up with the idea of an association treaty with ukraine at a time when , according to the german weekly die zeit , speculations over an eastward eu expansion are taboo . what 's more , french-speakers in switzerland , canada and belgium are furious that sarkozy wants to integrate broadcaster tv 5 monde in a purely french holding company .
the partner countries own a one-third share in the francophone broadcaster . distracted by local campaign but any judgements on sarkozy 's foreign policy should take into account that he 's under significant pressure abroad , said the director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg , frank baasner . " there are just a few weeks until the local elections , " said baasner .
" if his party suffers a setback , his popularity will be completely lost . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france takes over the eu presidency in july " france 's foreign policy is domestic policy , for the time being . " in de gaulle 's footsteps sarkozy is not the first president to be accused of going it alone or displaying his omnipotence .
charles de gaulle , the resistance general and post-war president made france into a nuclear power independent of the united states .
in 1962 , he called for a " europe of fatherlands " led by france . baasner pointed to the continuity between de gaulle and sarkozy .
the idea that europe is an extension of france is deeply rooted in the french consciousness , he said . but france 's current president also has his own style , said baasner .
" what surprises even the french is the coolness , the near aggressiveness of his style . " that aggressiveness was most recently on display earlier this week when , during a visit to a paris agricultural fair , sarkozy insulted a bystander who refused to shake his hand , telling the man to " get lost , " followed by some choice french expletives . nevertheless , many european leaders have had to go through crises before finally becoming grounded .
sarkozy - and france - may just have to prepare for a process of refinement " through the power of reality , " baasner said . andreas leixnering -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

agriculture minister michel barnier was hard-pressed to calm the ensuing storm of protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france does n't want turkey in the eu but suggested an association treaty for ukraine in early february , eu commission president jose manuel barroso reprimanded the french government for not making enough of an effort to economize . also at the beginning of the month , french diplomats came up with the idea of an association treaty with ukraine at a time when , according to the german weekly die zeit , speculations over an eastward eu expansion are taboo . what 's more , french-speakers in switzerland , canada and belgium are furious that sarkozy wants to integrate broadcaster tv 5 monde in a purely french holding company .
the partner countries own a one-third share in the francophone broadcaster . distracted by local campaign but any judgements on sarkozy 's foreign policy should take into account that he 's under significant pressure abroad , said the director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg , frank baasner . " there are just a few weeks until the local elections , " said baasner .
" if his party suffers a setback , his popularity will be completely lost . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france takes over the eu presidency in july " france 's foreign policy is domestic policy , for the time being . " in de gaulle 's footsteps sarkozy is not the first president to be accused of going it alone or displaying his omnipotence .
charles de gaulle , the resistance general and post-war president made france into a nuclear power independent of the united states .
in 1962 , he called for a " europe of fatherlands " led by france . baasner pointed to the continuity between de gaulle and sarkozy .
the idea that europe is an extension of france is deeply rooted in the french consciousness , he said . but france 's current president also has his own style , said baasner .
" what surprises even the french is the coolness , the near aggressiveness of his style . " that aggressiveness was most recently on display earlier this week when , during a visit to a paris agricultural fair , sarkozy insulted a bystander who refused to shake his hand , telling the man to " get lost , " followed by some choice french expletives . nevertheless , many european leaders have had to go through crises before finally becoming grounded .
sarkozy - and france - may just have to prepare for a process of refinement " through the power of reality , " baasner said . andreas leixnering -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in january , a court in the northern state of schleswig-holstein reached a similar conclusion , saying swedish energy company vattenfall could not transfer energy output from muehlheim-kaerlich , where it also has a power plant , to a power plant in brunsbüttel . each nuclear power plant 's remaining operational time is measured in terms of the amount of power it is allowed to generate .
a 2002 law governing germany 's plans to eliminate nuclear power only allows a company to transfer energy output from one plant to another in very specific cases . utilities vs. public opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-nuke activists say it is a greener energy alternative rwe had asked to transfer the allowance to produce 30 terawatt hours of electricity from muehlheim-kaerlich to biblis a. without the transfer the biblis a plant would run until about september 2009 .
had it been approved , the transfer would have kept the biblis a plant open through federal elections in 2009 . rwe said wednesday , feb .
27 , that it planned to appeal the verdict at the federal administrative court . german utilities - including e.on , the world 's largest utility by sales - are battling public opinion and politicians to change an agreement with the government under which they have to shut all their nuclear power plants by the early 2020s . hoping for shift in political winds they want to use their profitable nuclear power stations for several years longer , and hope that a possible change in the country 's political makeup could lead to a reversal of the decision to eliminate nuclear power . utilities argue that nuclear power produces less carbon dioxide , a gas causing global warming , and would help keep power prices down , as fuels such as coal have climbed to record highs . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

basic rights are n't disposable , says dw 's daphne antachopoulos . the court decision follows the same guideline as many other verdicts from the constitutional court in karlsruhe : security laws may not undermine basic rights . the judges reached a similar conclusion in deciding whether to allow authorities to bug private apartments or shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked by terrorists .
human and civil rights take precedence over the nearly insatiable need for security cultivated by some politicians . the now invalid law in north rhine-westphalia had allowed authorities to access a suspect 's hard drive and keep it under regular surveillance - under the condition that they expected to find evidence of anti-constitutional activity . such a massive intrusion should not be possible on such vague grounds , the karlsruhe court decided .
rather , the state may secretly spy on someone only if there is strong evidence that personal safety , lives , freedom , state property or the foundation of human existence are endangered .
and only with permission from a judge . those are high hurdles .
and that 's how they should be . it was n't a coincidence that court president hans-juergen papier said the decision had implications beyond the case in north rhine-westphalia .
his words were directed at interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who is planning a federal law allowing for online surveillance of crime suspects . schaeuble 's credo is that the threat of terrorism is omnipresent , invisible and incalculable .
therefore , the state should take such measures in order to prevent this danger .
according to schaeuble , all surveillance and combat instruments should be able to be used even in fully abstract situations of danger . fortunately , karlsruhe clamped down first .
basic rights are n't disposable regardless of the need for security .
the criteria for state action must be very concretely defined , particularly when a basic right is so massively intruded upon .
innocent people should not be targeted by the state with such sweeping , preventive blows . wednesday 's court decision recalled yet another axiom : not only do we need protection by the state but also from the state . if every citizen is treated like a potential terrorist and his or her private sphere is monitored , the state will have a hard time convincing its citizens that it also wants to protect them . wolfgang schaeuble said he will take the court decision into account .
the question remains why these kinds of issues always have to be resolved in karlsruhe and not first in berlin . it seems as if politicians responsible for security always want to test the boundaries - and the constitutional court is then forced to draw the line . daphne antachopoulos is a reporter for deutsche welle specializing in german domestic and foreign policy . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 28.02.2008 opinion : german politicians test citizens ' rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's highest court ruled that authorities may use computer spyware to secretly collect data from personal computers , but only under strict conditions .
basic rights are n't disposable , says dw 's daphne antachopoulos . the court decision follows the same guideline as many other verdicts from the constitutional court in karlsruhe : security laws may not undermine basic rights . the judges reached a similar conclusion in deciding whether to allow authorities to bug private apartments or shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked by terrorists .
human and civil rights take precedence over the nearly insatiable need for security cultivated by some politicians . the now invalid law in north rhine-westphalia had allowed authorities to access a suspect 's hard drive and keep it under regular surveillance - under the condition that they expected to find evidence of anti-constitutional activity . such a massive intrusion should not be possible on such vague grounds , the karlsruhe court decided .
rather , the state may secretly spy on someone only if there is strong evidence that personal safety , lives , freedom , state property or the foundation of human existence are endangered .
and only with permission from a judge . those are high hurdles .
and that 's how they should be . it was n't a coincidence that court president hans-juergen papier said the decision had implications beyond the case in north rhine-westphalia .
his words were directed at interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who is planning a federal law allowing for online surveillance of crime suspects . schaeuble 's credo is that the threat of terrorism is omnipresent , invisible and incalculable .
therefore , the state should take such measures in order to prevent this danger .
according to schaeuble , all surveillance and combat instruments should be able to be used even in fully abstract situations of danger . fortunately , karlsruhe clamped down first .
basic rights are n't disposable regardless of the need for security .
the criteria for state action must be very concretely defined , particularly when a basic right is so massively intruded upon .
innocent people should not be targeted by the state with such sweeping , preventive blows . wednesday 's court decision recalled yet another axiom : not only do we need protection by the state but also from the state . if every citizen is treated like a potential terrorist and his or her private sphere is monitored , the state will have a hard time convincing its citizens that it also wants to protect them . wolfgang schaeuble said he will take the court decision into account .

few know that it also spawned the current chancellor . from one-time revolutionary joschka fischer to former raf defense lawyer otto schily , a rebellious youth seems to be a rite-of-passage for german politicians .
those two went on to become the last german administration 's foreign and interior ministers . until now , however , no one ever suspected that chancellor angela merkel boasts equally street-smart credentials . a woman who looks as though she would n't even risk jaywalking , merkel revealed in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's magazine to be published friday , feb .
28 , that as a veteran of the infamous berlin squat scene , she too once enjoyed a spell on society 's margins . during her 20s , she explained , she lived illegally in an apartment in the district of mitte , a now gentrified neighborhood in the heart of what was once communist east berlin . apparently , she had struggled to find accommodation when she moved to berlin from leipzig with her first husband in 1978 to work in a science institute .

and unlike in the west , squatting in east berlin did n't necessarily entail endless cans of beer , dogs on strings and torn leather jackets . it just meant moving into a vacant apartment .
" the state renting agency was no longer aware of which buildings were empty and which were n't , " she said .
" i took advantage of their confusion out of desperation . "
but while her peers on the other side of the berlin wall saw squatting as a rejection of mainstream society , indulging in free love , experimenting with drugs and never failing to play their music really loud , merkel the pastor 's daughter made sure she paid rent .

the scene spawned a generation of anarcho-punks , making the city a counter-cultural haven .
few know that it also spawned the current chancellor . from one-time revolutionary joschka fischer to former raf defense lawyer otto schily , a rebellious youth seems to be a rite-of-passage for german politicians .
those two went on to become the last german administration 's foreign and interior ministers . until now , however , no one ever suspected that chancellor angela merkel boasts equally street-smart credentials . a woman who looks as though she would n't even risk jaywalking , merkel revealed in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's magazine to be published friday , feb .
28 , that as a veteran of the infamous berlin squat scene , she too once enjoyed a spell on society 's margins . during her 20s , she explained , she lived illegally in an apartment in the district of mitte , a now gentrified neighborhood in the heart of what was once communist east berlin . apparently , she had struggled to find accommodation when she moved to berlin from leipzig with her first husband in 1978 to work in a science institute .

it 's hard to imagine her western colleagues , such as prissy family minister ursula von der leyen , taking similar action - let alone gym-lovin ' condoleezza rice or ultra-groomed hillary clinton , who would surely balk at the lack of running water , outside toilets and hungry rodents that are par for the course in the average squat .
but merkel , the first german chancellor to have grown up in the gdr , is made of sterner stuff .
and unlike in the west , squatting in east berlin did n't necessarily entail endless cans of beer , dogs on strings and torn leather jackets . it just meant moving into a vacant apartment .
" the state renting agency was no longer aware of which buildings were empty and which were n't , " she said .
" i took advantage of their confusion out of desperation . "
but while her peers on the other side of the berlin wall saw squatting as a rejection of mainstream society , indulging in free love , experimenting with drugs and never failing to play their music really loud , merkel the pastor 's daughter made sure she paid rent .

some government officials and renewable energy experts say he 's needlessly spreading panic . power outages are a common occurrence not just in developing countries .
in the united states , for example , florida residents are still dealing with the chaos resulting from a wide-ranging blackout that affected nearly a million households .
in germany , though , people expect that when they flip a switch or plug in an appliance , power will be in ready supply . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the chaos that hit florida headed across the atlantic ?
this notion was put in doubt on thursday , feb .
28 , when juergen grossmann , the head of german power giant rwe , warned that germany and the rest of europe could experience power outages lasting several days this summer due to a lack of power stations . " power is growing short all over europe because there are not enough power stations , " grossmann told the bild newspaper .
" right now , all we need is the combination of a hot , dry summer and the shutdown of more power stations for maintenance for power security to be endangered . " no energy gap , government says his comments were repudiated on friday by government officials and representatives of some parts of the energy sector . environment ministry spokesman michael schroeren said it would be mistaken for germans to believe that the lights would go out and people would be unable to operate their washing machines due to a lack of power this summer . " all the figures show that there is no reason to speak of an energy gap , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one expert said there 's no reason for germans to stock up on candles schroeren added that while it is true that energy production can be restricted during periods of very hot weather , german citizens generally do not feel the effects . the federal association for hydropower and energy -lrb- bdew -rrb- said that " potential shortages could be the result if many negative factors were to come together at once . " germany 's renewable energy branch reacted with scorn to grossmann 's comments .
the head of the federal association for renewable energy -lrb- bee -rrb- , milan nitzschke , said there are no energy gaps in germany . " this is pure fear-mongering , " he added . competing interests in german " energy mix " there has been ongoing debate in germany about the country 's optimal " energy mix . " germany has committed to a total phase-out of nuclear power by 2020 and to increasing the proportion of energy that comes from renewable sources .
chancellor angela merkel , however , has spoken out for an energy mix that includes nuclear power , as well as more energy generated by coal-fired power stations . merkel 's government plans to build up to 25 new coal-fired plants in order to fill the gap left when nuclear plants are taken offline .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 28.02.2008 eon gives in to eu pressure , sells power network großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eon will continue to produce energy , but someone else will distribute it in future in a shock move , german energy giant eon has said it will sell its power grid in order to end a major antitrust investigation by the european commission .
the eu hopes other power companies will follow eon 's lead . the eu 's executive body said on thursday , feb .
28 , that it would check whether the move by eon will end the company 's antitrust problems .
the european commission has been trying for years to push energy companies to divest their grids in order to increase competition in the electricity and gas market and make prices more consumer-friendly . eu leaders agreed last year to separate power production from distribution networks .
the commission favors complete " ownership unbundling " or having an independent company to run pipelines and energy grids , but a group of eight countries , led by france and germany , was pursuing an alternative to avoid the break-up of their vertically integrated utilities . eon 's announcement on thursday came as a complete turnaround . " eon proposes to commit to sell its electricity transmission system network to an operator which would have no interest in the electricity generation and / or supply business , " the european commission said in a statement . move could end antitrust inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels will now check whether it antitrust proceedings against eon can be dropped eu economics ministers were meeting in brussels on thursday to discuss ways of increasing competition in the gas and power sector .
eu energy commissioner andris pielbalgs welcomed eon 's decision , adding that he hoped other companies would act in a similar fashion . wulf bernotat , chief executive of eon , had discussed the possible sale with german chancellor angela merkel , a government spokesperson said .
still , the news is likely to have come as a surprise , as the german government had made a point of lobbying in brussels for the company to avoid such a sell-off . the company has also promised to divest 4,800 megawatts of generation capacity to rivals .
brussels said it would ask eon 's customers and competitors for their views on the proposal , and would close the antitrust cases once a legally binding decision was made . eu aims to lower prices the eu 's investigations concerned problems in the power sector where , according to brussels , former state-run monopolies had too much control over the supply chain , keeping prices high and limiting much-needed investment to expand capacity . " we have been aware for some time that eon but also rwe and vattenfall are in close touch with investment banks to sell their grids , " claude turmes , a member of the european parliament 's energy committee for the greens group , told reuters .
" this is a tipping point in the debate . " rwe , germany 's second-largest utility , said it was not going to sell its grid . a spokesman for vattenfall europe , a swedish-based company that is vertically integrated in germany , confirmed that it was looking at alternative ownership structures for its german transmission network . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the scene spawned a generation of anarcho-punks , making the city a counter-cultural haven .
few know that it also spawned the current chancellor . from one-time revolutionary joschka fischer to former raf defense lawyer otto schily , a rebellious youth seems to be a rite-of-passage for german politicians .
those two went on to become the last german administration 's foreign and interior ministers . until now , however , no one ever suspected that chancellor angela merkel boasts equally street-smart credentials . a woman who looks as though she would n't even risk jaywalking , merkel revealed in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's magazine to be published friday , feb .
28 , that as a veteran of the infamous berlin squat scene , she too once enjoyed a spell on society 's margins . during her 20s , she explained , she lived illegally in an apartment in the district of mitte , a now gentrified neighborhood in the heart of what was once communist east berlin . apparently , she had struggled to find accommodation when she moved to berlin from leipzig with her first husband in 1978 to work in a science institute .
so what 's a girl to do but reach for the nearest crowbar ? radical chic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a far cry from the german chancellery others might have resorted to scanning the classifieds , but communist east germany raised its citizens to get their hands dirty .
it 's hard to imagine her western colleagues , such as prissy family minister ursula von der leyen , taking similar action - let alone gym-lovin ' condoleezza rice or ultra-groomed hillary clinton , who would surely balk at the lack of running water , outside toilets and hungry rodents that are par for the course in the average squat .
but merkel , the first german chancellor to have grown up in the gdr , is made of sterner stuff .
and unlike in the west , squatting in east berlin did n't necessarily entail endless cans of beer , dogs on strings and torn leather jackets . it just meant moving into a vacant apartment .
" the state renting agency was no longer aware of which buildings were empty and which were n't , " she said .
" i took advantage of their confusion out of desperation . "
but while her peers on the other side of the berlin wall saw squatting as a rejection of mainstream society , indulging in free love , experimenting with drugs and never failing to play their music really loud , merkel the pastor 's daughter made sure she paid rent .
" i simply transferred money to the state renting agency , " she said .
" at the time all money was most welcome . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

family affairs minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the decision , saying it showed the government was facing up to its responsibilites .
" we can not overvalue the extraordinary achievements of thalidomide victims , who have fought for success in their professional and private lives , " she said .
" they deserve society 's respect . "
" i am also confident that the government can cooperate with the gruenenthal company to develop a plan for further benefits to thalidomide victims , " she added . " talks begun in 2007 on how to improve their situation have been promising . "

the scene spawned a generation of anarcho-punks , making the city a counter-cultural haven .
few know that it also spawned the current chancellor . from one-time revolutionary joschka fischer to former raf defense lawyer otto schily , a rebellious youth seems to be a rite-of-passage for german politicians .
those two went on to become the last german administration 's foreign and interior ministers . until now , however , no one ever suspected that chancellor angela merkel boasts equally street-smart credentials . a woman who looks as though she would n't even risk jaywalking , merkel revealed in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's magazine to be published friday , feb .
28 , that as a veteran of the infamous berlin squat scene , she too once enjoyed a spell on society 's margins . during her 20s , she explained , she lived illegally in an apartment in the district of mitte , a now gentrified neighborhood in the heart of what was once communist east berlin . apparently , she had struggled to find accommodation when she moved to berlin from leipzig with her first husband in 1978 to work in a science institute .
so what 's a girl to do but reach for the nearest crowbar ? radical chic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a far cry from the german chancellery others might have resorted to scanning the classifieds , but communist east germany raised its citizens to get their hands dirty .
it 's hard to imagine her western colleagues , such as prissy family minister ursula von der leyen , taking similar action - let alone gym-lovin ' condoleezza rice or ultra-groomed hillary clinton , who would surely balk at the lack of running water , outside toilets and hungry rodents that are par for the course in the average squat .
but merkel , the first german chancellor to have grown up in the gdr , is made of sterner stuff .
and unlike in the west , squatting in east berlin did n't necessarily entail endless cans of beer , dogs on strings and torn leather jackets . it just meant moving into a vacant apartment .
" the state renting agency was no longer aware of which buildings were empty and which were n't , " she said .
" i took advantage of their confusion out of desperation . "
but while her peers on the other side of the berlin wall saw squatting as a rejection of mainstream society , indulging in free love , experimenting with drugs and never failing to play their music really loud , merkel the pastor 's daughter made sure she paid rent .
" i simply transferred money to the state renting agency , " she said .
" at the time all money was most welcome . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the scene spawned a generation of anarcho-punks , making the city a counter-cultural haven .
few know that it also spawned the current chancellor . from one-time revolutionary joschka fischer to former raf defense lawyer otto schily , a rebellious youth seems to be a rite-of-passage for german politicians .
those two went on to become the last german administration 's foreign and interior ministers . until now , however , no one ever suspected that chancellor angela merkel boasts equally street-smart credentials . a woman who looks as though she would n't even risk jaywalking , merkel revealed in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's magazine to be published friday , feb .
28 , that as a veteran of the infamous berlin squat scene , she too once enjoyed a spell on society 's margins . during her 20s , she explained , she lived illegally in an apartment in the district of mitte , a now gentrified neighborhood in the heart of what was once communist east berlin . apparently , she had struggled to find accommodation when she moved to berlin from leipzig with her first husband in 1978 to work in a science institute .
so what 's a girl to do but reach for the nearest crowbar ? radical chic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a far cry from the german chancellery others might have resorted to scanning the classifieds , but communist east germany raised its citizens to get their hands dirty .
it 's hard to imagine her western colleagues , such as prissy family minister ursula von der leyen , taking similar action - let alone gym-lovin ' condoleezza rice or ultra-groomed hillary clinton , who would surely balk at the lack of running water , outside toilets and hungry rodents that are par for the course in the average squat .
but merkel , the first german chancellor to have grown up in the gdr , is made of sterner stuff .
and unlike in the west , squatting in east berlin did n't necessarily entail endless cans of beer , dogs on strings and torn leather jackets . it just meant moving into a vacant apartment .
" the state renting agency was no longer aware of which buildings were empty and which were n't , " she said .
" i took advantage of their confusion out of desperation . "
but while her peers on the other side of the berlin wall saw squatting as a rejection of mainstream society , indulging in free love , experimenting with drugs and never failing to play their music really loud , merkel the pastor 's daughter made sure she paid rent .

some government officials and renewable energy experts say he 's needlessly spreading panic . power outages are a common occurrence not just in developing countries .

" germany 's renewable energy branch reacted with scorn to grossmann 's comments .
the head of the federal association for renewable energy -lrb- bee -rrb- , milan nitzschke , said there are no energy gaps in germany . " this is pure fear-mongering , " he added . competing interests in german " energy mix " there has been ongoing debate in germany about the country 's optimal " energy mix . " germany has committed to a total phase-out of nuclear power by 2020 and to increasing the proportion of energy that comes from renewable sources .
chancellor angela merkel , however , has spoken out for an energy mix that includes nuclear power , as well as more energy generated by coal-fired power stations . merkel 's government plans to build up to 25 new coal-fired plants in order to fill the gap left when nuclear plants are taken offline .

the european commission has been trying for years to push energy companies to divest their grids in order to increase competition in the electricity and gas market and make prices more consumer-friendly . eu leaders agreed last year to separate power production from distribution networks .

still , the news is likely to have come as a surprise , as the german government had made a point of lobbying in brussels for the company to avoid such a sell-off . the company has also promised to divest 4,800 megawatts of generation capacity to rivals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 28.02.2008 go-it-alone sarkozy irks europe with lack of tact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy prefers to take his own path , but that 's not going over well in europe after less than a year in office , the popularity of french president nicolas sarkozy is dwindling rapidly .
apart from irritating the french , he 's been ruffling feathers abroad - most recently in berlin . scheduling difficulties - this diplomatic euphemism was the official reason from paris for letting two franco-german meetings slip through the cracks this week . french finance minister christine lagarde should have been received by her german counterpart , peer steinbrueck , on tuesday , feb .
26 , but le president had something else in mind : he took the minister on a trip to visit businesses in the countryside .
after all , local elections take place on march 9 and 16 , so bilateral relations apparently have to take a backseat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are n't quite so amicable right now several days ago , sarkozy postponed a march 3 meeting with chancellor angela merkel by three months .
the unofficial summit had been planned far in advance . " club med " concerns chancellor at the diplomatic level , the cancellations are brushed off as inconsequential .
but it 's no a secret that ties between paris and berlin are n't exactly close .
the german chancellor is still disgruntled about sarkozy 's mediterranean union initative .
originally conceived as a kind of consolation prize for turkey , which sarkozy does n't want in the eu , it 's become a serious project for the french president . germany , however , is worried that france is splitting the eu and looking to take a leadership role in europe .
and sarkozy 's invitation to the mediterranean heads of state to visit paris on july 13 - one day before the rest of the eu heads of state arrive to celebrate france taking over the eu presidency - did nothing to dispel concerns . berlin is not alone in its irritation with the french president , who took office in may last year . broken promises , tactless plans in january of this year , he promised french fishermen that he would do away with fishing quotas when his country assumes the eu presidency on july 1 .
but just a few weeks earlier , france had signed a fishing regulation law .
agriculture minister michel barnier was hard-pressed to calm the ensuing storm of protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france does n't want turkey in the eu but suggested an association treaty for ukraine in early february , eu commission president jose manuel barroso reprimanded the french government for not making enough of an effort to economize . also at the beginning of the month , french diplomats came up with the idea of an association treaty with ukraine at a time when , according to the german weekly die zeit , speculations over an eastward eu expansion are taboo . what 's more , french-speakers in switzerland , canada and belgium are furious that sarkozy wants to integrate broadcaster tv 5 monde in a purely french holding company .
the partner countries own a one-third share in the francophone broadcaster . distracted by local campaign but any judgements on sarkozy 's foreign policy should take into account that he 's under significant pressure abroad , said the director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg , frank baasner . " there are just a few weeks until the local elections , " said baasner .
" if his party suffers a setback , his popularity will be completely lost . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france takes over the eu presidency in july " france 's foreign policy is domestic policy , for the time being . " in de gaulle 's footsteps sarkozy is not the first president to be accused of going it alone or displaying his omnipotence .
charles de gaulle , the resistance general and post-war president made france into a nuclear power independent of the united states .
in 1962 , he called for a " europe of fatherlands " led by france . baasner pointed to the continuity between de gaulle and sarkozy .
the idea that europe is an extension of france is deeply rooted in the french consciousness , he said . but france 's current president also has his own style , said baasner .
" what surprises even the french is the coolness , the near aggressiveness of his style . " that aggressiveness was most recently on display earlier this week when , during a visit to a paris agricultural fair , sarkozy insulted a bystander who refused to shake his hand , telling the man to " get lost , " followed by some choice french expletives . nevertheless , many european leaders have had to go through crises before finally becoming grounded .
sarkozy - and france - may just have to prepare for a process of refinement " through the power of reality , " baasner said . andreas leixnering -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

apart from irritating the french , he 's been ruffling feathers abroad - most recently in berlin . scheduling difficulties - this diplomatic euphemism was the official reason from paris for letting two franco-german meetings slip through the cracks this week . french finance minister christine lagarde should have been received by her german counterpart , peer steinbrueck , on tuesday , feb .
26 , but le president had something else in mind : he took the minister on a trip to visit businesses in the countryside .
after all , local elections take place on march 9 and 16 , so bilateral relations apparently have to take a backseat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are n't quite so amicable right now several days ago , sarkozy postponed a march 3 meeting with chancellor angela merkel by three months .
the unofficial summit had been planned far in advance . " club med " concerns chancellor at the diplomatic level , the cancellations are brushed off as inconsequential .
but it 's no a secret that ties between paris and berlin are n't exactly close .
the german chancellor is still disgruntled about sarkozy 's mediterranean union initative .
originally conceived as a kind of consolation prize for turkey , which sarkozy does n't want in the eu , it 's become a serious project for the french president . germany , however , is worried that france is splitting the eu and looking to take a leadership role in europe .
and sarkozy 's invitation to the mediterranean heads of state to visit paris on july 13 - one day before the rest of the eu heads of state arrive to celebrate france taking over the eu presidency - did nothing to dispel concerns . berlin is not alone in its irritation with the french president , who took office in may last year . broken promises , tactless plans in january of this year , he promised french fishermen that he would do away with fishing quotas when his country assumes the eu presidency on july 1 .
but just a few weeks earlier , france had signed a fishing regulation law .
agriculture minister michel barnier was hard-pressed to calm the ensuing storm of protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france does n't want turkey in the eu but suggested an association treaty for ukraine in early february , eu commission president jose manuel barroso reprimanded the french government for not making enough of an effort to economize . also at the beginning of the month , french diplomats came up with the idea of an association treaty with ukraine at a time when , according to the german weekly die zeit , speculations over an eastward eu expansion are taboo . what 's more , french-speakers in switzerland , canada and belgium are furious that sarkozy wants to integrate broadcaster tv 5 monde in a purely french holding company .
the partner countries own a one-third share in the francophone broadcaster . distracted by local campaign but any judgements on sarkozy 's foreign policy should take into account that he 's under significant pressure abroad , said the director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg , frank baasner . " there are just a few weeks until the local elections , " said baasner .
" if his party suffers a setback , his popularity will be completely lost . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france takes over the eu presidency in july " france 's foreign policy is domestic policy , for the time being . " in de gaulle 's footsteps sarkozy is not the first president to be accused of going it alone or displaying his omnipotence .
charles de gaulle , the resistance general and post-war president made france into a nuclear power independent of the united states .
in 1962 , he called for a " europe of fatherlands " led by france . baasner pointed to the continuity between de gaulle and sarkozy .
the idea that europe is an extension of france is deeply rooted in the french consciousness , he said . but france 's current president also has his own style , said baasner .
" what surprises even the french is the coolness , the near aggressiveness of his style . " that aggressiveness was most recently on display earlier this week when , during a visit to a paris agricultural fair , sarkozy insulted a bystander who refused to shake his hand , telling the man to " get lost , " followed by some choice french expletives . nevertheless , many european leaders have had to go through crises before finally becoming grounded .
sarkozy - and france - may just have to prepare for a process of refinement " through the power of reality , " baasner said . andreas leixnering -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not the first in the area , the sale suggests the district has failed to become the thriving commercial center the city intended . sony said thursday , feb .
28 , that as part of its streamlining efforts , it would be selling the berlin sony center to a group of german and us investment funds , including investment bank morgan stanley , corpus sireo and an affiliate of the john buck company . the sprawling entertainment complex in the center of the german capital houses offices , stores , restaurants and a cinema and attracts over 8 million visitors a year .
but the company now says it plans to focus on core business areas such as electronics . the sony companies located on the premises will remain tenants , and the center will keep the group 's name , it said in a statement .
the sale is expected to be completed by the end of next month subject to regulatory approval . financial loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what does the future hold for potsdamer platz ?
the move is not entirely unexpected .
in 2006 , the iconic japanese company 's first foreign head , howard stringer , announced 10,000 job cuts and plans for a swathe of asset disposals in an effort to revive its flagging fortunes . the company did not divulge the value of the deal but said the expected profits had already been factored into its earlier forecast for a 471 percent surge in operating profit to 410 billion yen -lrb- $ 3.8 billion , 2.5 billion euros -rrb- in the current fiscal year to march . insiders say sony will be paid less than 600 million euros for the building that originally cost the japanese company 750 million euros in the late 1990s . a failed vision for the capital one of the most ambitious development projects in post-reunification germany , the spectacular domed building designed by architect helmut jahn first opened in june 2000 . it was hailed as a symbol of the new , reunited berlin .
but along with other real estate on potsdamer platz - such as the 19 buildings making up the daimler " quartier , " which sold to the swedish banking group seb last december for an estimated 1.2 billion euros - it failed to help turn the neighborhood into the capital 's new commercial district . to many , the sale will confirm suspicions of waning confidence in the potsdamer platz project - especially given that sony was allegedly unable to find a buyer willing to pay its initial asking price of 800 million euros . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu hopes other power companies will follow eon 's lead . the eu 's executive body said on thursday , feb .
28 , that it would check whether the move by eon will end the company 's antitrust problems .
the european commission has been trying for years to push energy companies to divest their grids in order to increase competition in the electricity and gas market and make prices more consumer-friendly . eu leaders agreed last year to separate power production from distribution networks .
the commission favors complete " ownership unbundling " or having an independent company to run pipelines and energy grids , but a group of eight countries , led by france and germany , was pursuing an alternative to avoid the break-up of their vertically integrated utilities . eon 's announcement on thursday came as a complete turnaround . " eon proposes to commit to sell its electricity transmission system network to an operator which would have no interest in the electricity generation and / or supply business , " the european commission said in a statement . move could end antitrust inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels will now check whether it antitrust proceedings against eon can be dropped eu economics ministers were meeting in brussels on thursday to discuss ways of increasing competition in the gas and power sector .

the eu hopes other power companies will follow eon 's lead . the eu 's executive body said on thursday , feb .
28 , that it would check whether the move by eon will end the company 's antitrust problems .
the european commission has been trying for years to push energy companies to divest their grids in order to increase competition in the electricity and gas market and make prices more consumer-friendly . eu leaders agreed last year to separate power production from distribution networks .
the commission favors complete " ownership unbundling " or having an independent company to run pipelines and energy grids , but a group of eight countries , led by france and germany , was pursuing an alternative to avoid the break-up of their vertically integrated utilities . eon 's announcement on thursday came as a complete turnaround . " eon proposes to commit to sell its electricity transmission system network to an operator which would have no interest in the electricity generation and / or supply business , " the european commission said in a statement . move could end antitrust inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels will now check whether it antitrust proceedings against eon can be dropped eu economics ministers were meeting in brussels on thursday to discuss ways of increasing competition in the gas and power sector .
eu energy commissioner andris pielbalgs welcomed eon 's decision , adding that he hoped other companies would act in a similar fashion . wulf bernotat , chief executive of eon , had discussed the possible sale with german chancellor angela merkel , a government spokesperson said .

not the first in the area , the sale suggests the district has failed to become the thriving commercial center the city intended . sony said thursday , feb .
28 , that as part of its streamlining efforts , it would be selling the berlin sony center to a group of german and us investment funds , including investment bank morgan stanley , corpus sireo and an affiliate of the john buck company . the sprawling entertainment complex in the center of the german capital houses offices , stores , restaurants and a cinema and attracts over 8 million visitors a year .
but the company now says it plans to focus on core business areas such as electronics . the sony companies located on the premises will remain tenants , and the center will keep the group 's name , it said in a statement .
the sale is expected to be completed by the end of next month subject to regulatory approval . financial loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what does the future hold for potsdamer platz ?
the move is not entirely unexpected .
in 2006 , the iconic japanese company 's first foreign head , howard stringer , announced 10,000 job cuts and plans for a swathe of asset disposals in an effort to revive its flagging fortunes . the company did not divulge the value of the deal but said the expected profits had already been factored into its earlier forecast for a 471 percent surge in operating profit to 410 billion yen -lrb- $ 3.8 billion , 2.5 billion euros -rrb- in the current fiscal year to march . insiders say sony will be paid less than 600 million euros for the building that originally cost the japanese company 750 million euros in the late 1990s . a failed vision for the capital one of the most ambitious development projects in post-reunification germany , the spectacular domed building designed by architect helmut jahn first opened in june 2000 . it was hailed as a symbol of the new , reunited berlin .
but along with other real estate on potsdamer platz - such as the 19 buildings making up the daimler " quartier , " which sold to the swedish banking group seb last december for an estimated 1.2 billion euros - it failed to help turn the neighborhood into the capital 's new commercial district . to many , the sale will confirm suspicions of waning confidence in the potsdamer platz project - especially given that sony was allegedly unable to find a buyer willing to pay its initial asking price of 800 million euros . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu hopes other power companies will follow eon 's lead . the eu 's executive body said on thursday , feb .
28 , that it would check whether the move by eon will end the company 's antitrust problems .
the european commission has been trying for years to push energy companies to divest their grids in order to increase competition in the electricity and gas market and make prices more consumer-friendly . eu leaders agreed last year to separate power production from distribution networks .
the commission favors complete " ownership unbundling " or having an independent company to run pipelines and energy grids , but a group of eight countries , led by france and germany , was pursuing an alternative to avoid the break-up of their vertically integrated utilities . eon 's announcement on thursday came as a complete turnaround . " eon proposes to commit to sell its electricity transmission system network to an operator which would have no interest in the electricity generation and / or supply business , " the european commission said in a statement . move could end antitrust inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels will now check whether it antitrust proceedings against eon can be dropped eu economics ministers were meeting in brussels on thursday to discuss ways of increasing competition in the gas and power sector .
eu energy commissioner andris pielbalgs welcomed eon 's decision , adding that he hoped other companies would act in a similar fashion . wulf bernotat , chief executive of eon , had discussed the possible sale with german chancellor angela merkel , a government spokesperson said .
still , the news is likely to have come as a surprise , as the german government had made a point of lobbying in brussels for the company to avoid such a sell-off . the company has also promised to divest 4,800 megawatts of generation capacity to rivals .
brussels said it would ask eon 's customers and competitors for their views on the proposal , and would close the antitrust cases once a legally binding decision was made . eu aims to lower prices the eu 's investigations concerned problems in the power sector where , according to brussels , former state-run monopolies had too much control over the supply chain , keeping prices high and limiting much-needed investment to expand capacity . " we have been aware for some time that eon but also rwe and vattenfall are in close touch with investment banks to sell their grids , " claude turmes , a member of the european parliament 's energy committee for the greens group , told reuters .
" this is a tipping point in the debate . " rwe , germany 's second-largest utility , said it was not going to sell its grid . a spokesman for vattenfall europe , a swedish-based company that is vertically integrated in germany , confirmed that it was looking at alternative ownership structures for its german transmission network . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in de gaulle 's footsteps sarkozy is not the first president to be accused of going it alone or displaying his omnipotence .
charles de gaulle , the resistance general and post-war president made france into a nuclear power independent of the united states .
in 1962 , he called for a " europe of fatherlands " led by france . baasner pointed to the continuity between de gaulle and sarkozy .
the idea that europe is an extension of france is deeply rooted in the french consciousness , he said . but france 's current president also has his own style , said baasner .
" what surprises even the french is the coolness , the near aggressiveness of his style . " that aggressiveness was most recently on display earlier this week when , during a visit to a paris agricultural fair , sarkozy insulted a bystander who refused to shake his hand , telling the man to " get lost , " followed by some choice french expletives . nevertheless , many european leaders have had to go through crises before finally becoming grounded .

the eu hopes other power companies will follow eon 's lead . the eu 's executive body said on thursday , feb .
28 , that it would check whether the move by eon will end the company 's antitrust problems .
the european commission has been trying for years to push energy companies to divest their grids in order to increase competition in the electricity and gas market and make prices more consumer-friendly . eu leaders agreed last year to separate power production from distribution networks .
the commission favors complete " ownership unbundling " or having an independent company to run pipelines and energy grids , but a group of eight countries , led by france and germany , was pursuing an alternative to avoid the break-up of their vertically integrated utilities . eon 's announcement on thursday came as a complete turnaround . " eon proposes to commit to sell its electricity transmission system network to an operator which would have no interest in the electricity generation and / or supply business , " the european commission said in a statement . move could end antitrust inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels will now check whether it antitrust proceedings against eon can be dropped eu economics ministers were meeting in brussels on thursday to discuss ways of increasing competition in the gas and power sector .
eu energy commissioner andris pielbalgs welcomed eon 's decision , adding that he hoped other companies would act in a similar fashion . wulf bernotat , chief executive of eon , had discussed the possible sale with german chancellor angela merkel , a government spokesperson said .
still , the news is likely to have come as a surprise , as the german government had made a point of lobbying in brussels for the company to avoid such a sell-off . the company has also promised to divest 4,800 megawatts of generation capacity to rivals .
brussels said it would ask eon 's customers and competitors for their views on the proposal , and would close the antitrust cases once a legally binding decision was made . eu aims to lower prices the eu 's investigations concerned problems in the power sector where , according to brussels , former state-run monopolies had too much control over the supply chain , keeping prices high and limiting much-needed investment to expand capacity . " we have been aware for some time that eon but also rwe and vattenfall are in close touch with investment banks to sell their grids , " claude turmes , a member of the european parliament 's energy committee for the greens group , told reuters .
" this is a tipping point in the debate . " rwe , germany 's second-largest utility , said it was not going to sell its grid . a spokesman for vattenfall europe , a swedish-based company that is vertically integrated in germany , confirmed that it was looking at alternative ownership structures for its german transmission network . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government 's crackdown on tax evaders comes courtesy of stolen bank data , for which germany 's intelligence service , the bnd , paid millions .
but now many have begun to ask : does the end justify the means ? investigators probing the scale of tax evasion by germans have already uncovered some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in funds stashed in trusts in liechtenstein - and that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
by the time investigators have finished , the 4.2 million euros paid to an informant alleged to have stolen client data from liechtenstein 's lgt bank in 2002 will look like a bargain-basement price in comparison with the vast sums reclaimed by the german finance ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the data bought by the bnd was reportedly stolen from the lgt group in 2002 despite this , the whole affair is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many ordinary germans as well as politicians who take issue with the methods used by the government to obtain the liechtenstein bank data .
a poll showed that 52 percent of voters think the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- should not have paid for the information , while just 41 percent think the payment was justified .
" ordinary germans feel a certain solidarity with the people who are now being investigated for tax evasion , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university .
" on some level , this is something everyone in germany tries to do , whether that involves writing off bigger sums in your tax declaration than you should , getting paid for work that you do n't declare or paying someone to work under the table for you , " he added .
" these people also do n't want to be caught , and so they have something against the government using such methods to pursue tax evaders . "
a great deal or a criminal act ?
the bnd normally has nothing to do with tax matters , but officials say it was offered the information and only acted on it after consulting the government and tax authorities .
a notarized contract for the sum paid to the informant was drawn up , and detailed records were kept every step of the way .
according to finance ministry officials , there 's no doubt that the data will be admissible in court .
finance minister peer steinbrück said he did n't want to imagine the " wave of indignation that would roll through the country " if the bnd had acted any differently .
but ferdinand von schirach , one of two lawyers who have said so far that they plan to sue the german state for its handling of the affair , said the government can not use taxpayers ' money to reward criminal acts - such as the stealing of confidential bank information .
" even though it seems like a great deal … a crime can not be committed , " he told reuters tv .
" if that was the case , the state would be no better than any criminal on the street . "
bnd must answer to parliamentary committee last week , the bnd was asked to brief a parliamentary committee on its methods so that the government could decide whether to approve or disapprove of the liechtenstein operation , but members of the parliamentary intelligence committee deemed more documents were needed .
the next briefing is set for march 5 .
speaking to the berlin-based newspaper , taz , following the initial briefing , green party parliamentarian christian ströbele stressed the need for rule of law , even when it comes to hunting down tax evaders .
" putting aside my joy that the right people are finally being targeted , the law has to be followed here , even against our richest citizens , " ströbele said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neskovic : bnd 's behavior is " clearly illegal " left party parliamentarian wolfgang neskovic was more critical .
" the bnd 's behavior is , in my view , clearly illegal , " he said .
but neskovic doubts whether the parliamentary session on march 5 will lead to any consequences for the intelligence agency .
" in this republic , there are unchecked zones , especially when it comes to the intelligence service , and this has to change , " said neskovic , a former federal court justice .

liechtenstein furious over german tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince alois says germany is attacking his nation the acting head of liechtenstein , hereditary prince alois , has described the bnd 's behavior as " highly suspect . "
he said the informant , who has been identified as former lgt bank employee heinrich kieber , had been convicted of stealing bank data in 2002 and imprisoned .
" obviously , germany wants to be a big-time receiver of stolen goods , " he said , also making thinly veiled references to germany 's past aggression in europe .
" we are also a sovereign state and - we hope - do not live in an era where might makes right . "
contributing to the war of words that 's been started with the tiny alpine state , german chancellor angela merkel accused liechtenstein 's banks of " encouraging lawbreaking , " and said that it and other tax havens should " mend their ways " or face the consequences .
swiss banks suspicious of espionage one of the consequences already emerging from the bnd 's liechtenstein operation is that germans applying for jobs at swiss banks will undergo additional scrutiny in future because of espionage concerns .
the thousands of germans already working in switzerland 's financial industry could also feel the effects of the german government 's crackdown .
the head of switzerland 's private banker 's association , michel derobert , said the methods used by the bnd to obtain the secret banking data from liechtenstein were " reprehensible " and would lead to extra precautions in switzerland to protect client privacy .

the german government 's crackdown on tax evaders comes courtesy of stolen bank data , for which germany 's intelligence service , the bnd , paid millions .
but now many have begun to ask : does the end justify the means ? investigators probing the scale of tax evasion by germans have already uncovered some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in funds stashed in trusts in liechtenstein - and that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
by the time investigators have finished , the 4.2 million euros paid to an informant alleged to have stolen client data from liechtenstein 's lgt bank in 2002 will look like a bargain-basement price in comparison with the vast sums reclaimed by the german finance ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the data bought by the bnd was reportedly stolen from the lgt group in 2002 despite this , the whole affair is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many ordinary germans as well as politicians who take issue with the methods used by the government to obtain the liechtenstein bank data .
a poll showed that 52 percent of voters think the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- should not have paid for the information , while just 41 percent think the payment was justified .
" ordinary germans feel a certain solidarity with the people who are now being investigated for tax evasion , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university .
" on some level , this is something everyone in germany tries to do , whether that involves writing off bigger sums in your tax declaration than you should , getting paid for work that you do n't declare or paying someone to work under the table for you , " he added .
" these people also do n't want to be caught , and so they have something against the government using such methods to pursue tax evaders . "
a great deal or a criminal act ?
the bnd normally has nothing to do with tax matters , but officials say it was offered the information and only acted on it after consulting the government and tax authorities .
a notarized contract for the sum paid to the informant was drawn up , and detailed records were kept every step of the way .
according to finance ministry officials , there 's no doubt that the data will be admissible in court .
finance minister peer steinbrück said he did n't want to imagine the " wave of indignation that would roll through the country " if the bnd had acted any differently .
but ferdinand von schirach , one of two lawyers who have said so far that they plan to sue the german state for its handling of the affair , said the government can not use taxpayers ' money to reward criminal acts - such as the stealing of confidential bank information .
" even though it seems like a great deal … a crime can not be committed , " he told reuters tv .
" if that was the case , the state would be no better than any criminal on the street . "
bnd must answer to parliamentary committee last week , the bnd was asked to brief a parliamentary committee on its methods so that the government could decide whether to approve or disapprove of the liechtenstein operation , but members of the parliamentary intelligence committee deemed more documents were needed .
the next briefing is set for march 5 .
speaking to the berlin-based newspaper , taz , following the initial briefing , green party parliamentarian christian ströbele stressed the need for rule of law , even when it comes to hunting down tax evaders .
" putting aside my joy that the right people are finally being targeted , the law has to be followed here , even against our richest citizens , " ströbele said .

basic rights are n't disposable , says dw 's daphne antachopoulos . the court decision follows the same guideline as many other verdicts from the constitutional court in karlsruhe : security laws may not undermine basic rights . the judges reached a similar conclusion in deciding whether to allow authorities to bug private apartments or shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked by terrorists .
human and civil rights take precedence over the nearly insatiable need for security cultivated by some politicians . the now invalid law in north rhine-westphalia had allowed authorities to access a suspect 's hard drive and keep it under regular surveillance - under the condition that they expected to find evidence of anti-constitutional activity . such a massive intrusion should not be possible on such vague grounds , the karlsruhe court decided .
rather , the state may secretly spy on someone only if there is strong evidence that personal safety , lives , freedom , state property or the foundation of human existence are endangered .
and only with permission from a judge . those are high hurdles .
and that 's how they should be . it was n't a coincidence that court president hans-juergen papier said the decision had implications beyond the case in north rhine-westphalia .
his words were directed at interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who is planning a federal law allowing for online surveillance of crime suspects . schaeuble 's credo is that the threat of terrorism is omnipresent , invisible and incalculable .
therefore , the state should take such measures in order to prevent this danger .
according to schaeuble , all surveillance and combat instruments should be able to be used even in fully abstract situations of danger . fortunately , karlsruhe clamped down first .
basic rights are n't disposable regardless of the need for security .
the criteria for state action must be very concretely defined , particularly when a basic right is so massively intruded upon .
innocent people should not be targeted by the state with such sweeping , preventive blows . wednesday 's court decision recalled yet another axiom : not only do we need protection by the state but also from the state . if every citizen is treated like a potential terrorist and his or her private sphere is monitored , the state will have a hard time convincing its citizens that it also wants to protect them . wolfgang schaeuble said he will take the court decision into account .
the question remains why these kinds of issues always have to be resolved in karlsruhe and not first in berlin . it seems as if politicians responsible for security always want to test the boundaries - and the constitutional court is then forced to draw the line . daphne antachopoulos is a reporter for deutsche welle specializing in german domestic and foreign policy . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

basic rights are n't disposable , says dw 's daphne antachopoulos . the court decision follows the same guideline as many other verdicts from the constitutional court in karlsruhe : security laws may not undermine basic rights . the judges reached a similar conclusion in deciding whether to allow authorities to bug private apartments or shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked by terrorists .
human and civil rights take precedence over the nearly insatiable need for security cultivated by some politicians . the now invalid law in north rhine-westphalia had allowed authorities to access a suspect 's hard drive and keep it under regular surveillance - under the condition that they expected to find evidence of anti-constitutional activity . such a massive intrusion should not be possible on such vague grounds , the karlsruhe court decided .
rather , the state may secretly spy on someone only if there is strong evidence that personal safety , lives , freedom , state property or the foundation of human existence are endangered .
and only with permission from a judge . those are high hurdles .
and that 's how they should be . it was n't a coincidence that court president hans-juergen papier said the decision had implications beyond the case in north rhine-westphalia .
his words were directed at interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who is planning a federal law allowing for online surveillance of crime suspects . schaeuble 's credo is that the threat of terrorism is omnipresent , invisible and incalculable .
therefore , the state should take such measures in order to prevent this danger .
according to schaeuble , all surveillance and combat instruments should be able to be used even in fully abstract situations of danger . fortunately , karlsruhe clamped down first .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 28.02.2008 controversial anne frank musical premieres in spain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the musical does n't directly quote anne frank 's diary the director of a musical about anne frank 's tragic story says his venue is a better way to reach young people than through a stuffy exhibit or book .
the show premieres in spain on thursday , feb .
28 . millions of people have read her diary ; numerous films have been made about her life in hiding from the nazis . at first glance , though , the story of anne frank , the young jewish girl forced into hiding for two years before finally meeting her death in a nazi concentration camp , does n't necessarily seem to lend itself to a musical format . but the musical has indeed taken the stage - " anne frank : a song to life , " which is more of a tragic opera , premieres in madrid 's haagen-dazs calderon theater on feb .
28 . the story centers around the diary , which anne received for her 13th birthday and which she named " kitty . " in the musical , smoke fills the stage floor as kitty enters as a glamorous woman dressed in glittering red .
the vision is a personification of young anne 's dreams of womanhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the diary is n't quoted directly in the musical spanish director rafael alvero said he got the idea 10 years ago when he was working in amsterdam and had a chance to visit the house where anne frank hid with her family from the nazis . " i felt i would one day bring the feelings , which the place and the story evoke , to the public through something i do with ease , which is produce music , " alvero told afp news agency . history vs. entertainment yet the musical sparked an international controversy over what critics said was a frivolous treatment of the story of a girl who died in the holocaust . anne frank 's oldest living relative , her 82-year-old cousin buddy elias , was fiercely opposed to the idea of the jewish girl 's story being presented as entertainment . he heads the swiss-based anne frank fonds , which holds exclusive publishing rights to her diary .
however , the organization could not take legal action against alvero because the diary is not directly quoted in the musical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne kept up her schoolwork while in hiding until his death in 1980 , anne frank 's father , otto frank , had refused to allow any artistic adaptations of his daughter 's diary . the anne frank foundation , which runs a museum in amsterdam , has , according to otto frank 's wishes , typically been cautious about backing artistic productions based on the girl 's story .
but elias told afp news agency that the fonds had not opposed earlier film , theater and tv adaptations because they were considered " realistic . " serious issues not new to musicals however , after its initial skepticism , the foundation threw its full support behind alvero and worked closely with him to ensure historical accuracy .
the director convinced the foundation with " his quality of work and high standards , " jan erik dubbelman , the international director , told spiegel online . alvero himself said that the stage adaptation is an effective way to share anne frank 's tragic story .
and since it 's in spanish , it can serve as a vehicle to bring a piece of holocaust history to latin america . he also pointed out that somber topics have been addressed in musicals before , such as in " les miserables " and " jesus christ superstar . " lead actress also lived in hiding anne frank began writing her diary on her 13th birthday in 1942 .
throughout the next two years she described everyday details of life in hiding , giving later generations a unique personal window into the holocaust period . bildunterschrift : anne -lrb- l -rrb- with her sister margot , before going into hiding she and her family were betrayed and arrested in 1944 , when they were deported to the bergen-belsen concentration camp .
anne died of typhus there in 1945 .
since then , her diary has been published in nearly 70 languages . comparisons have been made between anne frank and the 13-year-old girl who portrays her on stage , isabella castillo .
the latter fled cuba with her mother at a young age and the two hid for a time in belize on their way to the us .
that 's where the comparison stops , however . new face appears in another twist to frank 's life story , just this week , it was announced that the face of peter schiff , described as " my one true love " by anne frank in her diary , will be shown to the public for the first time by the anne frank museum in amsterdam . a photo of the boy , who was 13 when his adolescent romance began with then 11-year-old frank , was supplied by childhood friend ernst michaelis , who visited the museum last month with his children and grandchildren and felt he should offer up the picture . dw staff -lrb- als / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 . millions of people have read her diary ; numerous films have been made about her life in hiding from the nazis . at first glance , though , the story of anne frank , the young jewish girl forced into hiding for two years before finally meeting her death in a nazi concentration camp , does n't necessarily seem to lend itself to a musical format . but the musical has indeed taken the stage - " anne frank : a song to life , " which is more of a tragic opera , premieres in madrid 's haagen-dazs calderon theater on feb .
28 . the story centers around the diary , which anne received for her 13th birthday and which she named " kitty . " in the musical , smoke fills the stage floor as kitty enters as a glamorous woman dressed in glittering red .
the vision is a personification of young anne 's dreams of womanhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the diary is n't quoted directly in the musical spanish director rafael alvero said he got the idea 10 years ago when he was working in amsterdam and had a chance to visit the house where anne frank hid with her family from the nazis .

the show premieres in spain on thursday , feb .
28 . millions of people have read her diary ; numerous films have been made about her life in hiding from the nazis . at first glance , though , the story of anne frank , the young jewish girl forced into hiding for two years before finally meeting her death in a nazi concentration camp , does n't necessarily seem to lend itself to a musical format . but the musical has indeed taken the stage - " anne frank : a song to life , " which is more of a tragic opera , premieres in madrid 's haagen-dazs calderon theater on feb .
28 . the story centers around the diary , which anne received for her 13th birthday and which she named " kitty . " in the musical , smoke fills the stage floor as kitty enters as a glamorous woman dressed in glittering red .
the vision is a personification of young anne 's dreams of womanhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the diary is n't quoted directly in the musical spanish director rafael alvero said he got the idea 10 years ago when he was working in amsterdam and had a chance to visit the house where anne frank hid with her family from the nazis . " i felt i would one day bring the feelings , which the place and the story evoke , to the public through something i do with ease , which is produce music , " alvero told afp news agency . history vs. entertainment yet the musical sparked an international controversy over what critics said was a frivolous treatment of the story of a girl who died in the holocaust . anne frank 's oldest living relative , her 82-year-old cousin buddy elias , was fiercely opposed to the idea of the jewish girl 's story being presented as entertainment . he heads the swiss-based anne frank fonds , which holds exclusive publishing rights to her diary .
however , the organization could not take legal action against alvero because the diary is not directly quoted in the musical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne kept up her schoolwork while in hiding until his death in 1980 , anne frank 's father , otto frank , had refused to allow any artistic adaptations of his daughter 's diary . the anne frank foundation , which runs a museum in amsterdam , has , according to otto frank 's wishes , typically been cautious about backing artistic productions based on the girl 's story .
but elias told afp news agency that the fonds had not opposed earlier film , theater and tv adaptations because they were considered " realistic . " serious issues not new to musicals however , after its initial skepticism , the foundation threw its full support behind alvero and worked closely with him to ensure historical accuracy .
the director convinced the foundation with " his quality of work and high standards , " jan erik dubbelman , the international director , told spiegel online . alvero himself said that the stage adaptation is an effective way to share anne frank 's tragic story .
and since it 's in spanish , it can serve as a vehicle to bring a piece of holocaust history to latin america . he also pointed out that somber topics have been addressed in musicals before , such as in " les miserables " and " jesus christ superstar . " lead actress also lived in hiding anne frank began writing her diary on her 13th birthday in 1942 .
throughout the next two years she described everyday details of life in hiding , giving later generations a unique personal window into the holocaust period . bildunterschrift : anne -lrb- l -rrb- with her sister margot , before going into hiding she and her family were betrayed and arrested in 1944 , when they were deported to the bergen-belsen concentration camp .
anne died of typhus there in 1945 .
since then , her diary has been published in nearly 70 languages . comparisons have been made between anne frank and the 13-year-old girl who portrays her on stage , isabella castillo .
the latter fled cuba with her mother at a young age and the two hid for a time in belize on their way to the us .
that 's where the comparison stops , however . new face appears in another twist to frank 's life story , just this week , it was announced that the face of peter schiff , described as " my one true love " by anne frank in her diary , will be shown to the public for the first time by the anne frank museum in amsterdam . a photo of the boy , who was 13 when his adolescent romance began with then 11-year-old frank , was supplied by childhood friend ernst michaelis , who visited the museum last month with his children and grandchildren and felt he should offer up the picture . dw staff -lrb- als / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 28.02.2008 opinion : german politicians test citizens ' rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's highest court ruled that authorities may use computer spyware to secretly collect data from personal computers , but only under strict conditions .
basic rights are n't disposable , says dw 's daphne antachopoulos . the court decision follows the same guideline as many other verdicts from the constitutional court in karlsruhe : security laws may not undermine basic rights . the judges reached a similar conclusion in deciding whether to allow authorities to bug private apartments or shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked by terrorists .
human and civil rights take precedence over the nearly insatiable need for security cultivated by some politicians . the now invalid law in north rhine-westphalia had allowed authorities to access a suspect 's hard drive and keep it under regular surveillance - under the condition that they expected to find evidence of anti-constitutional activity . such a massive intrusion should not be possible on such vague grounds , the karlsruhe court decided .
rather , the state may secretly spy on someone only if there is strong evidence that personal safety , lives , freedom , state property or the foundation of human existence are endangered .
and only with permission from a judge . those are high hurdles .
and that 's how they should be . it was n't a coincidence that court president hans-juergen papier said the decision had implications beyond the case in north rhine-westphalia .
his words were directed at interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who is planning a federal law allowing for online surveillance of crime suspects . schaeuble 's credo is that the threat of terrorism is omnipresent , invisible and incalculable .
therefore , the state should take such measures in order to prevent this danger .
according to schaeuble , all surveillance and combat instruments should be able to be used even in fully abstract situations of danger . fortunately , karlsruhe clamped down first .
basic rights are n't disposable regardless of the need for security .
the criteria for state action must be very concretely defined , particularly when a basic right is so massively intruded upon .
innocent people should not be targeted by the state with such sweeping , preventive blows . wednesday 's court decision recalled yet another axiom : not only do we need protection by the state but also from the state . if every citizen is treated like a potential terrorist and his or her private sphere is monitored , the state will have a hard time convincing its citizens that it also wants to protect them . wolfgang schaeuble said he will take the court decision into account .
the question remains why these kinds of issues always have to be resolved in karlsruhe and not first in berlin . it seems as if politicians responsible for security always want to test the boundaries - and the constitutional court is then forced to draw the line . daphne antachopoulos is a reporter for deutsche welle specializing in german domestic and foreign policy . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu leaders want it to lead to more cooperation fighting tax evasion as well . liechtenstein prime minister otmar hasler on thursday , feb .
28 , welcomed an accord opening the way for his nation to enter europe 's open borders area , telling afp news agency it would be " an important step for integration and cooperation on fiscal matters . " the first-step accord to allow liechtenstein in the 24-nation schengen bloc came despite a tax fraud row with germany , which had threatened to block the move .
the tiny alpine principality has been accused of encouraging tax fraud with its lax fiscal code . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is among three osce-recognized tax havens an eu official told afp that " the subject passed without any debate " at a meeting of european union interior and justice ministers in brussels . the european justice and security commissioner franco frattini said the tax evasion investigations involving liechtenstein should not prevent the country from entering the visa-free travel zone . " -lsb- it -rsb- is very important to get liechtenstein in the schengen area , it is simply not possible to have an enclave in the center of europe , " frattini said before the signing ceremony . awaiting ratification the exact date of liechtenstein 's entry into the schengen area has not yet been set , but it has been closely tied to the adhesion of its bigger neighbor switzerland , which is due to join by november . the protocol allowing liechtenstein to implement schengen rules still needs to be ratified by all 27 eu nations , which could present an opportunity for one of them to use schengen to gain leverage over it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : problems could arise from a borderless tax haven germany spearheaded the crackdown on tax havens amid suspicions that hundreds of rich germans evaded taxes by parking money in liechtenstein banks .
despite this , however , germany has opted against vetoing the principality 's entry into the schengen agreement . asked if germany would hold off on approving liechtenstein 's accession to the european border-free area , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told reporters , " in principle we are willing to ratify it , but there have been talks -lsb- on combating fraud -rsb- , and they have to show some effect . " in addition to germany , investigators in the united states , britain , australia , italy , france , sweden , canada , new zealand , greece and spain are among the countries now hunting for nationals hiding their money in liechtenstein . currently on the blacklist hasler said his country is now seeking a " reasonable " tax fraud deal with the eu . " with respect to the current tax policy questions that are broadly and controversially debated in europe , we want to play our part in finding a reasonable agreement , " hasler told reuters news service .
" our aim is to achieve a successful conclusion of the comprehensive tax fraud agreement that is currently under negotiation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alpine country said would agree to a " reasonable " deal with the eu on tax matters liechtenstein is one of three countries on the organization for economic cooperation and development 's black list of uncooperative tax havens , alongside andorra and monaco . german chancellor angela merkel told hasler last week to take rapid action to combat fraud and make the principality 's finance sector more transparent . germany threatens measures after meeting with other eu finance ministers in brussels on thursday , german finance minister peer steinbrueck warned liechtenstein would face strong measures if there were no changes on the european level . " we will use pressure and influence on an eu level , " steinbrueck told the ruhr nachrichten newspaper . eu finance ministers plan to talk again on march 5 to discuss the topic .
if progress is n't made in europe as a whole , " then we will take measures within germany , " steinbrueck said . measures could include instituting disclosure requirements , or perhaps taxation at the source of every money transfer from germany to liechtenstein , he added . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not the first in the area , the sale suggests the district has failed to become the thriving commercial center the city intended . sony said thursday , feb .
28 , that as part of its streamlining efforts , it would be selling the berlin sony center to a group of german and us investment funds , including investment bank morgan stanley , corpus sireo and an affiliate of the john buck company . the sprawling entertainment complex in the center of the german capital houses offices , stores , restaurants and a cinema and attracts over 8 million visitors a year .
but the company now says it plans to focus on core business areas such as electronics . the sony companies located on the premises will remain tenants , and the center will keep the group 's name , it said in a statement .
the sale is expected to be completed by the end of next month subject to regulatory approval . financial loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what does the future hold for potsdamer platz ?
the move is not entirely unexpected .
in 2006 , the iconic japanese company 's first foreign head , howard stringer , announced 10,000 job cuts and plans for a swathe of asset disposals in an effort to revive its flagging fortunes . the company did not divulge the value of the deal but said the expected profits had already been factored into its earlier forecast for a 471 percent surge in operating profit to 410 billion yen -lrb- $ 3.8 billion , 2.5 billion euros -rrb- in the current fiscal year to march . insiders say sony will be paid less than 600 million euros for the building that originally cost the japanese company 750 million euros in the late 1990s . a failed vision for the capital one of the most ambitious development projects in post-reunification germany , the spectacular domed building designed by architect helmut jahn first opened in june 2000 . it was hailed as a symbol of the new , reunited berlin .
but along with other real estate on potsdamer platz - such as the 19 buildings making up the daimler " quartier , " which sold to the swedish banking group seb last december for an estimated 1.2 billion euros - it failed to help turn the neighborhood into the capital 's new commercial district . to many , the sale will confirm suspicions of waning confidence in the potsdamer platz project - especially given that sony was allegedly unable to find a buyer willing to pay its initial asking price of 800 million euros . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government 's crackdown on tax evaders comes courtesy of stolen bank data , for which germany 's intelligence service , the bnd , paid millions .
but now many have begun to ask : does the end justify the means ? investigators probing the scale of tax evasion by germans have already uncovered some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in funds stashed in trusts in liechtenstein - and that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
by the time investigators have finished , the 4.2 million euros paid to an informant alleged to have stolen client data from liechtenstein 's lgt bank in 2002 will look like a bargain-basement price in comparison with the vast sums reclaimed by the german finance ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the data bought by the bnd was reportedly stolen from the lgt group in 2002 despite this , the whole affair is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many ordinary germans as well as politicians who take issue with the methods used by the government to obtain the liechtenstein bank data .
a poll showed that 52 percent of voters think the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- should not have paid for the information , while just 41 percent think the payment was justified .
" ordinary germans feel a certain solidarity with the people who are now being investigated for tax evasion , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university .
" on some level , this is something everyone in germany tries to do , whether that involves writing off bigger sums in your tax declaration than you should , getting paid for work that you do n't declare or paying someone to work under the table for you , " he added .
" these people also do n't want to be caught , and so they have something against the government using such methods to pursue tax evaders . "
a great deal or a criminal act ?
the bnd normally has nothing to do with tax matters , but officials say it was offered the information and only acted on it after consulting the government and tax authorities .
a notarized contract for the sum paid to the informant was drawn up , and detailed records were kept every step of the way .
according to finance ministry officials , there 's no doubt that the data will be admissible in court .
finance minister peer steinbrück said he did n't want to imagine the " wave of indignation that would roll through the country " if the bnd had acted any differently .
but ferdinand von schirach , one of two lawyers who have said so far that they plan to sue the german state for its handling of the affair , said the government can not use taxpayers ' money to reward criminal acts - such as the stealing of confidential bank information .
" even though it seems like a great deal … a crime can not be committed , " he told reuters tv .
" if that was the case , the state would be no better than any criminal on the street . "
bnd must answer to parliamentary committee last week , the bnd was asked to brief a parliamentary committee on its methods so that the government could decide whether to approve or disapprove of the liechtenstein operation , but members of the parliamentary intelligence committee deemed more documents were needed .
the next briefing is set for march 5 .
speaking to the berlin-based newspaper , taz , following the initial briefing , green party parliamentarian christian ströbele stressed the need for rule of law , even when it comes to hunting down tax evaders .
" putting aside my joy that the right people are finally being targeted , the law has to be followed here , even against our richest citizens , " ströbele said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neskovic : bnd 's behavior is " clearly illegal " left party parliamentarian wolfgang neskovic was more critical .
" the bnd 's behavior is , in my view , clearly illegal , " he said .
but neskovic doubts whether the parliamentary session on march 5 will lead to any consequences for the intelligence agency .
" in this republic , there are unchecked zones , especially when it comes to the intelligence service , and this has to change , " said neskovic , a former federal court justice .
" what we know of up to now is just a drop , and what we do n't know amounts to an ocean . "
liechtenstein furious over german tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince alois says germany is attacking his nation the acting head of liechtenstein , hereditary prince alois , has described the bnd 's behavior as " highly suspect . "
he said the informant , who has been identified as former lgt bank employee heinrich kieber , had been convicted of stealing bank data in 2002 and imprisoned .
" obviously , germany wants to be a big-time receiver of stolen goods , " he said , also making thinly veiled references to germany 's past aggression in europe .
" we are also a sovereign state and - we hope - do not live in an era where might makes right . "
contributing to the war of words that 's been started with the tiny alpine state , german chancellor angela merkel accused liechtenstein 's banks of " encouraging lawbreaking , " and said that it and other tax havens should " mend their ways " or face the consequences .
swiss banks suspicious of espionage one of the consequences already emerging from the bnd 's liechtenstein operation is that germans applying for jobs at swiss banks will undergo additional scrutiny in future because of espionage concerns .
the thousands of germans already working in switzerland 's financial industry could also feel the effects of the german government 's crackdown .
the head of switzerland 's private banker 's association , michel derobert , said the methods used by the bnd to obtain the secret banking data from liechtenstein were " reprehensible " and would lead to extra precautions in switzerland to protect client privacy .
germany 's purchase of the data will discourage swiss banks from employing germans , he told the swiss daily le matin . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in january , a court in the northern state of schleswig-holstein reached a similar conclusion , saying swedish energy company vattenfall could not transfer energy output from muehlheim-kaerlich , where it also has a power plant , to a power plant in brunsbüttel . each nuclear power plant 's remaining operational time is measured in terms of the amount of power it is allowed to generate .
a 2002 law governing germany 's plans to eliminate nuclear power only allows a company to transfer energy output from one plant to another in very specific cases . utilities vs. public opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-nuke activists say it is a greener energy alternative rwe had asked to transfer the allowance to produce 30 terawatt hours of electricity from muehlheim-kaerlich to biblis a. without the transfer the biblis a plant would run until about september 2009 .
had it been approved , the transfer would have kept the biblis a plant open through federal elections in 2009 . rwe said wednesday , feb .
27 , that it planned to appeal the verdict at the federal administrative court . german utilities - including e.on , the world 's largest utility by sales - are battling public opinion and politicians to change an agreement with the government under which they have to shut all their nuclear power plants by the early 2020s . hoping for shift in political winds they want to use their profitable nuclear power stations for several years longer , and hope that a possible change in the country 's political makeup could lead to a reversal of the decision to eliminate nuclear power . utilities argue that nuclear power produces less carbon dioxide , a gas causing global warming , and would help keep power prices down , as fuels such as coal have climbed to record highs . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the scene spawned a generation of anarcho-punks , making the city a counter-cultural haven .
few know that it also spawned the current chancellor . from one-time revolutionary joschka fischer to former raf defense lawyer otto schily , a rebellious youth seems to be a rite-of-passage for german politicians .

basic rights are n't disposable , says dw 's daphne antachopoulos . the court decision follows the same guideline as many other verdicts from the constitutional court in karlsruhe : security laws may not undermine basic rights . the judges reached a similar conclusion in deciding whether to allow authorities to bug private apartments or shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked by terrorists .
human and civil rights take precedence over the nearly insatiable need for security cultivated by some politicians . the now invalid law in north rhine-westphalia had allowed authorities to access a suspect 's hard drive and keep it under regular surveillance - under the condition that they expected to find evidence of anti-constitutional activity . such a massive intrusion should not be possible on such vague grounds , the karlsruhe court decided .
rather , the state may secretly spy on someone only if there is strong evidence that personal safety , lives , freedom , state property or the foundation of human existence are endangered .
and only with permission from a judge . those are high hurdles .
and that 's how they should be . it was n't a coincidence that court president hans-juergen papier said the decision had implications beyond the case in north rhine-westphalia .
his words were directed at interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who is planning a federal law allowing for online surveillance of crime suspects . schaeuble 's credo is that the threat of terrorism is omnipresent , invisible and incalculable .
therefore , the state should take such measures in order to prevent this danger .
according to schaeuble , all surveillance and combat instruments should be able to be used even in fully abstract situations of danger . fortunately , karlsruhe clamped down first .

eu leaders want it to lead to more cooperation fighting tax evasion as well . liechtenstein prime minister otmar hasler on thursday , feb .
28 , welcomed an accord opening the way for his nation to enter europe 's open borders area , telling afp news agency it would be " an important step for integration and cooperation on fiscal matters . " the first-step accord to allow liechtenstein in the 24-nation schengen bloc came despite a tax fraud row with germany , which had threatened to block the move .
the tiny alpine principality has been accused of encouraging tax fraud with its lax fiscal code . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is among three osce-recognized tax havens an eu official told afp that " the subject passed without any debate " at a meeting of european union interior and justice ministers in brussels . the european justice and security commissioner franco frattini said the tax evasion investigations involving liechtenstein should not prevent the country from entering the visa-free travel zone . " -lsb- it -rsb- is very important to get liechtenstein in the schengen area , it is simply not possible to have an enclave in the center of europe , " frattini said before the signing ceremony . awaiting ratification the exact date of liechtenstein 's entry into the schengen area has not yet been set , but it has been closely tied to the adhesion of its bigger neighbor switzerland , which is due to join by november . the protocol allowing liechtenstein to implement schengen rules still needs to be ratified by all 27 eu nations , which could present an opportunity for one of them to use schengen to gain leverage over it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : problems could arise from a borderless tax haven germany spearheaded the crackdown on tax havens amid suspicions that hundreds of rich germans evaded taxes by parking money in liechtenstein banks .
despite this , however , germany has opted against vetoing the principality 's entry into the schengen agreement . asked if germany would hold off on approving liechtenstein 's accession to the european border-free area , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told reporters , " in principle we are willing to ratify it , but there have been talks -lsb- on combating fraud -rsb- , and they have to show some effect . " in addition to germany , investigators in the united states , britain , australia , italy , france , sweden , canada , new zealand , greece and spain are among the countries now hunting for nationals hiding their money in liechtenstein . currently on the blacklist hasler said his country is now seeking a " reasonable " tax fraud deal with the eu . " with respect to the current tax policy questions that are broadly and controversially debated in europe , we want to play our part in finding a reasonable agreement , " hasler told reuters news service .
" our aim is to achieve a successful conclusion of the comprehensive tax fraud agreement that is currently under negotiation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alpine country said would agree to a " reasonable " deal with the eu on tax matters liechtenstein is one of three countries on the organization for economic cooperation and development 's black list of uncooperative tax havens , alongside andorra and monaco . german chancellor angela merkel told hasler last week to take rapid action to combat fraud and make the principality 's finance sector more transparent . germany threatens measures after meeting with other eu finance ministers in brussels on thursday , german finance minister peer steinbrueck warned liechtenstein would face strong measures if there were no changes on the european level . " we will use pressure and influence on an eu level , " steinbrueck told the ruhr nachrichten newspaper . eu finance ministers plan to talk again on march 5 to discuss the topic .
if progress is n't made in europe as a whole , " then we will take measures within germany , " steinbrueck said . measures could include instituting disclosure requirements , or perhaps taxation at the source of every money transfer from germany to liechtenstein , he added . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

britain said it would sponsor a donor summit for the african nation . in a bid to end a post-election crisis that plunged kenya into its worst turmoil since independence , president mwai kibaki and rival raila odinga signed a deal on thursday to create a power-sharing government . " we have a deal , " mediator and former united nations secretary-general kofi annan said .
" compromise was necessary for the survival of this country ... they kept the future of kenya always in their sights and reached a common position for the good of the nation . " the united states , britain and the european union applauded the deal , which they had pushed to be inked as soon as possible in order to end bitter negotiations and outbreaks of violence around the country in the past month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post-election violence caused thousands to flee their homes eu commissioner for development louis michel spoke of a " great day for kenya and its people , " and praised annan 's tireless efforts as a mediator in the crisis . eu foreign policy chief javier solana also praised annan 's efforts and said he hoped peace would return to kenya . " this is a particularly important agreement that will enable kenya to return to stability and prosperity and will also have a positive impact throughout the region , " solana said in a statement . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also welcomed thursday 's deal . " kenya has grasped the opportunity to resolve its political crisis peacefully and to return to stability , " he said . in order to help the new government to its feet , british prime minister gordon brown said he would sponsor a donor summit to provide aid to kenya . " we 'd be prepared in london to host a donors conference to make sure kenya has the best chance to build upon this power-sharing agreement , to restore tourism -lrb- and -rrb- get the economy moving again , " he told reporters after speaking to annan . ethnic clashes resulted from disputed election bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism in kenya drastically dropped when violence broke out kibaki 's disputed reelection on dec .
27 , 2007 triggered unrest that killed some 1,000 people and forced 300,000 more to flee their homes . thursday 's deal creates a new prime minister 's post for odinga , who has sought that job since he first helped kibaki to power in 2002 . the deal also assigns cabinet posts based on each party 's strength in parliament , and creates two deputy prime minister positions , one for each side of the coalition . " as a nation , there are more issues that unite than divide us , " said kibaki after the signing .
" we 've been reminded that we must do all in our power to safeguard the peace that is the foundation of our national unity .

basic rights are n't disposable , says dw 's daphne antachopoulos . the court decision follows the same guideline as many other verdicts from the constitutional court in karlsruhe : security laws may not undermine basic rights . the judges reached a similar conclusion in deciding whether to allow authorities to bug private apartments or shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked by terrorists .
human and civil rights take precedence over the nearly insatiable need for security cultivated by some politicians . the now invalid law in north rhine-westphalia had allowed authorities to access a suspect 's hard drive and keep it under regular surveillance - under the condition that they expected to find evidence of anti-constitutional activity . such a massive intrusion should not be possible on such vague grounds , the karlsruhe court decided .
rather , the state may secretly spy on someone only if there is strong evidence that personal safety , lives , freedom , state property or the foundation of human existence are endangered .
and only with permission from a judge . those are high hurdles .
and that 's how they should be . it was n't a coincidence that court president hans-juergen papier said the decision had implications beyond the case in north rhine-westphalia .
his words were directed at interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who is planning a federal law allowing for online surveillance of crime suspects . schaeuble 's credo is that the threat of terrorism is omnipresent , invisible and incalculable .
therefore , the state should take such measures in order to prevent this danger .
according to schaeuble , all surveillance and combat instruments should be able to be used even in fully abstract situations of danger . fortunately , karlsruhe clamped down first .
basic rights are n't disposable regardless of the need for security .
the criteria for state action must be very concretely defined , particularly when a basic right is so massively intruded upon .
innocent people should not be targeted by the state with such sweeping , preventive blows . wednesday 's court decision recalled yet another axiom : not only do we need protection by the state but also from the state . if every citizen is treated like a potential terrorist and his or her private sphere is monitored , the state will have a hard time convincing its citizens that it also wants to protect them . wolfgang schaeuble said he will take the court decision into account .
the question remains why these kinds of issues always have to be resolved in karlsruhe and not first in berlin . it seems as if politicians responsible for security always want to test the boundaries - and the constitutional court is then forced to draw the line . daphne antachopoulos is a reporter for deutsche welle specializing in german domestic and foreign policy . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

apart from irritating the french , he 's been ruffling feathers abroad - most recently in berlin . scheduling difficulties - this diplomatic euphemism was the official reason from paris for letting two franco-german meetings slip through the cracks this week . french finance minister christine lagarde should have been received by her german counterpart , peer steinbrueck , on tuesday , feb .
26 , but le president had something else in mind : he took the minister on a trip to visit businesses in the countryside .
after all , local elections take place on march 9 and 16 , so bilateral relations apparently have to take a backseat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are n't quite so amicable right now several days ago , sarkozy postponed a march 3 meeting with chancellor angela merkel by three months .
the unofficial summit had been planned far in advance . " club med " concerns chancellor at the diplomatic level , the cancellations are brushed off as inconsequential .
but it 's no a secret that ties between paris and berlin are n't exactly close .
the german chancellor is still disgruntled about sarkozy 's mediterranean union initative .
originally conceived as a kind of consolation prize for turkey , which sarkozy does n't want in the eu , it 's become a serious project for the french president . germany , however , is worried that france is splitting the eu and looking to take a leadership role in europe .
and sarkozy 's invitation to the mediterranean heads of state to visit paris on july 13 - one day before the rest of the eu heads of state arrive to celebrate france taking over the eu presidency - did nothing to dispel concerns . berlin is not alone in its irritation with the french president , who took office in may last year . broken promises , tactless plans in january of this year , he promised french fishermen that he would do away with fishing quotas when his country assumes the eu presidency on july 1 .
but just a few weeks earlier , france had signed a fishing regulation law .
agriculture minister michel barnier was hard-pressed to calm the ensuing storm of protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france does n't want turkey in the eu but suggested an association treaty for ukraine in early february , eu commission president jose manuel barroso reprimanded the french government for not making enough of an effort to economize . also at the beginning of the month , french diplomats came up with the idea of an association treaty with ukraine at a time when , according to the german weekly die zeit , speculations over an eastward eu expansion are taboo . what 's more , french-speakers in switzerland , canada and belgium are furious that sarkozy wants to integrate broadcaster tv 5 monde in a purely french holding company .
the partner countries own a one-third share in the francophone broadcaster . distracted by local campaign but any judgements on sarkozy 's foreign policy should take into account that he 's under significant pressure abroad , said the director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg , frank baasner . " there are just a few weeks until the local elections , " said baasner .
" if his party suffers a setback , his popularity will be completely lost . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france takes over the eu presidency in july " france 's foreign policy is domestic policy , for the time being . " in de gaulle 's footsteps sarkozy is not the first president to be accused of going it alone or displaying his omnipotence .
charles de gaulle , the resistance general and post-war president made france into a nuclear power independent of the united states .
in 1962 , he called for a " europe of fatherlands " led by france . baasner pointed to the continuity between de gaulle and sarkozy .
the idea that europe is an extension of france is deeply rooted in the french consciousness , he said . but france 's current president also has his own style , said baasner .
" what surprises even the french is the coolness , the near aggressiveness of his style . " that aggressiveness was most recently on display earlier this week when , during a visit to a paris agricultural fair , sarkozy insulted a bystander who refused to shake his hand , telling the man to " get lost , " followed by some choice french expletives . nevertheless , many european leaders have had to go through crises before finally becoming grounded .
sarkozy - and france - may just have to prepare for a process of refinement " through the power of reality , " baasner said . andreas leixnering -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in january , a court in the northern state of schleswig-holstein reached a similar conclusion , saying swedish energy company vattenfall could not transfer energy output from muehlheim-kaerlich , where it also has a power plant , to a power plant in brunsbüttel . each nuclear power plant 's remaining operational time is measured in terms of the amount of power it is allowed to generate .
a 2002 law governing germany 's plans to eliminate nuclear power only allows a company to transfer energy output from one plant to another in very specific cases . utilities vs. public opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-nuke activists say it is a greener energy alternative rwe had asked to transfer the allowance to produce 30 terawatt hours of electricity from muehlheim-kaerlich to biblis a. without the transfer the biblis a plant would run until about september 2009 .
had it been approved , the transfer would have kept the biblis a plant open through federal elections in 2009 . rwe said wednesday , feb .
27 , that it planned to appeal the verdict at the federal administrative court . german utilities - including e.on , the world 's largest utility by sales - are battling public opinion and politicians to change an agreement with the government under which they have to shut all their nuclear power plants by the early 2020s . hoping for shift in political winds they want to use their profitable nuclear power stations for several years longer , and hope that a possible change in the country 's political makeup could lead to a reversal of the decision to eliminate nuclear power . utilities argue that nuclear power produces less carbon dioxide , a gas causing global warming , and would help keep power prices down , as fuels such as coal have climbed to record highs . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

family affairs minister ursula von der leyen welcomed the decision , saying it showed the government was facing up to its responsibilites .
" we can not overvalue the extraordinary achievements of thalidomide victims , who have fought for success in their professional and private lives , " she said .
" they deserve society 's respect . "
" i am also confident that the government can cooperate with the gruenenthal company to develop a plan for further benefits to thalidomide victims , " she added . " talks begun in 2007 on how to improve their situation have been promising . "
extra help needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drug claimed 10,000 victims all over the world the move came after a public outcry against germany 's limited help for aging thalidomide victims .
around 10,000 babies around the world were born with disabilities as a result of their mothers taking the drug , marketed in germany under the brand name contergan . just under half of those survived .
others learned to live with disabilities such as extremely shortened or missing limbs , or missing organs .
the over-the-counter remedy was taken off the market four years after its launch and better drug regulation introduced round the globe .
but 50 years on , the victims are now middle-aged .
with their parents dying off , they need extra help to relieve sore joints and compensate for a life of poor earnings .
currently the 2,870 victims in germany receive a stipend of up to 545 euros monthly , depending on their degree of disability , from a trust fund set up by gruenenthal and the german government .

the eu hopes other power companies will follow eon 's lead . the eu 's executive body said on thursday , feb .
28 , that it would check whether the move by eon will end the company 's antitrust problems .
the european commission has been trying for years to push energy companies to divest their grids in order to increase competition in the electricity and gas market and make prices more consumer-friendly . eu leaders agreed last year to separate power production from distribution networks .
the commission favors complete " ownership unbundling " or having an independent company to run pipelines and energy grids , but a group of eight countries , led by france and germany , was pursuing an alternative to avoid the break-up of their vertically integrated utilities . eon 's announcement on thursday came as a complete turnaround . " eon proposes to commit to sell its electricity transmission system network to an operator which would have no interest in the electricity generation and / or supply business , " the european commission said in a statement . move could end antitrust inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels will now check whether it antitrust proceedings against eon can be dropped eu economics ministers were meeting in brussels on thursday to discuss ways of increasing competition in the gas and power sector .
eu energy commissioner andris pielbalgs welcomed eon 's decision , adding that he hoped other companies would act in a similar fashion . wulf bernotat , chief executive of eon , had discussed the possible sale with german chancellor angela merkel , a government spokesperson said .
still , the news is likely to have come as a surprise , as the german government had made a point of lobbying in brussels for the company to avoid such a sell-off . the company has also promised to divest 4,800 megawatts of generation capacity to rivals .
brussels said it would ask eon 's customers and competitors for their views on the proposal , and would close the antitrust cases once a legally binding decision was made . eu aims to lower prices the eu 's investigations concerned problems in the power sector where , according to brussels , former state-run monopolies had too much control over the supply chain , keeping prices high and limiting much-needed investment to expand capacity . " we have been aware for some time that eon but also rwe and vattenfall are in close touch with investment banks to sell their grids , " claude turmes , a member of the european parliament 's energy committee for the greens group , told reuters .
" this is a tipping point in the debate . " rwe , germany 's second-largest utility , said it was not going to sell its grid . a spokesman for vattenfall europe , a swedish-based company that is vertically integrated in germany , confirmed that it was looking at alternative ownership structures for its german transmission network . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the first-step accord to allow liechtenstein in the 24-nation schengen bloc came despite a tax fraud row with germany , which had threatened to block the move .
the tiny alpine principality has been accused of encouraging tax fraud with its lax fiscal code . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is among three osce-recognized tax havens an eu official told afp that " the subject passed without any debate " at a meeting of european union interior and justice ministers in brussels . the european justice and security commissioner franco frattini said the tax evasion investigations involving liechtenstein should not prevent the country from entering the visa-free travel zone . " -lsb- it -rsb- is very important to get liechtenstein in the schengen area , it is simply not possible to have an enclave in the center of europe , " frattini said before the signing ceremony . awaiting ratification the exact date of liechtenstein 's entry into the schengen area has not yet been set , but it has been closely tied to the adhesion of its bigger neighbor switzerland , which is due to join by november . the protocol allowing liechtenstein to implement schengen rules still needs to be ratified by all 27 eu nations , which could present an opportunity for one of them to use schengen to gain leverage over it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : problems could arise from a borderless tax haven germany spearheaded the crackdown on tax havens amid suspicions that hundreds of rich germans evaded taxes by parking money in liechtenstein banks .
despite this , however , germany has opted against vetoing the principality 's entry into the schengen agreement . asked if germany would hold off on approving liechtenstein 's accession to the european border-free area , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told reporters , " in principle we are willing to ratify it , but there have been talks -lsb- on combating fraud -rsb- , and they have to show some effect . " in addition to germany , investigators in the united states , britain , australia , italy , france , sweden , canada , new zealand , greece and spain are among the countries now hunting for nationals hiding their money in liechtenstein . currently on the blacklist hasler said his country is now seeking a " reasonable " tax fraud deal with the eu . " with respect to the current tax policy questions that are broadly and controversially debated in europe , we want to play our part in finding a reasonable agreement , " hasler told reuters news service .
" our aim is to achieve a successful conclusion of the comprehensive tax fraud agreement that is currently under negotiation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alpine country said would agree to a " reasonable " deal with the eu on tax matters liechtenstein is one of three countries on the organization for economic cooperation and development 's black list of uncooperative tax havens , alongside andorra and monaco . german chancellor angela merkel told hasler last week to take rapid action to combat fraud and make the principality 's finance sector more transparent . germany threatens measures after meeting with other eu finance ministers in brussels on thursday , german finance minister peer steinbrueck warned liechtenstein would face strong measures if there were no changes on the european level . " we will use pressure and influence on an eu level , " steinbrueck told the ruhr nachrichten newspaper . eu finance ministers plan to talk again on march 5 to discuss the topic .
if progress is n't made in europe as a whole , " then we will take measures within germany , " steinbrueck said . measures could include instituting disclosure requirements , or perhaps taxation at the source of every money transfer from germany to liechtenstein , he added . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some government officials and renewable energy experts say he 's needlessly spreading panic . power outages are a common occurrence not just in developing countries .
in the united states , for example , florida residents are still dealing with the chaos resulting from a wide-ranging blackout that affected nearly a million households .

this notion was put in doubt on thursday , feb .
28 , when juergen grossmann , the head of german power giant rwe , warned that germany and the rest of europe could experience power outages lasting several days this summer due to a lack of power stations . " power is growing short all over europe because there are not enough power stations , " grossmann told the bild newspaper .

" germany 's renewable energy branch reacted with scorn to grossmann 's comments .
the head of the federal association for renewable energy -lrb- bee -rrb- , milan nitzschke , said there are no energy gaps in germany . " this is pure fear-mongering , " he added . competing interests in german " energy mix " there has been ongoing debate in germany about the country 's optimal " energy mix . " germany has committed to a total phase-out of nuclear power by 2020 and to increasing the proportion of energy that comes from renewable sources .
chancellor angela merkel , however , has spoken out for an energy mix that includes nuclear power , as well as more energy generated by coal-fired power stations . merkel 's government plans to build up to 25 new coal-fired plants in order to fill the gap left when nuclear plants are taken offline .
the plans have met with enormous resistance from environmental groups and citizens ' initiatives who see the plans as a backwards step for a country that is meant to be assuming a leading role worldwide in the promotion of clean energy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

apart from irritating the french , he 's been ruffling feathers abroad - most recently in berlin . scheduling difficulties - this diplomatic euphemism was the official reason from paris for letting two franco-german meetings slip through the cracks this week . french finance minister christine lagarde should have been received by her german counterpart , peer steinbrueck , on tuesday , feb .
26 , but le president had something else in mind : he took the minister on a trip to visit businesses in the countryside .
after all , local elections take place on march 9 and 16 , so bilateral relations apparently have to take a backseat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are n't quite so amicable right now several days ago , sarkozy postponed a march 3 meeting with chancellor angela merkel by three months .
the unofficial summit had been planned far in advance . " club med " concerns chancellor at the diplomatic level , the cancellations are brushed off as inconsequential .
but it 's no a secret that ties between paris and berlin are n't exactly close .
the german chancellor is still disgruntled about sarkozy 's mediterranean union initative .
originally conceived as a kind of consolation prize for turkey , which sarkozy does n't want in the eu , it 's become a serious project for the french president . germany , however , is worried that france is splitting the eu and looking to take a leadership role in europe .
and sarkozy 's invitation to the mediterranean heads of state to visit paris on july 13 - one day before the rest of the eu heads of state arrive to celebrate france taking over the eu presidency - did nothing to dispel concerns . berlin is not alone in its irritation with the french president , who took office in may last year . broken promises , tactless plans in january of this year , he promised french fishermen that he would do away with fishing quotas when his country assumes the eu presidency on july 1 .
but just a few weeks earlier , france had signed a fishing regulation law .
agriculture minister michel barnier was hard-pressed to calm the ensuing storm of protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france does n't want turkey in the eu but suggested an association treaty for ukraine in early february , eu commission president jose manuel barroso reprimanded the french government for not making enough of an effort to economize . also at the beginning of the month , french diplomats came up with the idea of an association treaty with ukraine at a time when , according to the german weekly die zeit , speculations over an eastward eu expansion are taboo . what 's more , french-speakers in switzerland , canada and belgium are furious that sarkozy wants to integrate broadcaster tv 5 monde in a purely french holding company .
the partner countries own a one-third share in the francophone broadcaster . distracted by local campaign but any judgements on sarkozy 's foreign policy should take into account that he 's under significant pressure abroad , said the director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg , frank baasner . " there are just a few weeks until the local elections , " said baasner .
" if his party suffers a setback , his popularity will be completely lost . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france takes over the eu presidency in july " france 's foreign policy is domestic policy , for the time being . " in de gaulle 's footsteps sarkozy is not the first president to be accused of going it alone or displaying his omnipotence .
charles de gaulle , the resistance general and post-war president made france into a nuclear power independent of the united states .
in 1962 , he called for a " europe of fatherlands " led by france . baasner pointed to the continuity between de gaulle and sarkozy .
the idea that europe is an extension of france is deeply rooted in the french consciousness , he said . but france 's current president also has his own style , said baasner .
" what surprises even the french is the coolness , the near aggressiveness of his style . " that aggressiveness was most recently on display earlier this week when , during a visit to a paris agricultural fair , sarkozy insulted a bystander who refused to shake his hand , telling the man to " get lost , " followed by some choice french expletives . nevertheless , many european leaders have had to go through crises before finally becoming grounded .
sarkozy - and france - may just have to prepare for a process of refinement " through the power of reality , " baasner said . andreas leixnering -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in january , a court in the northern state of schleswig-holstein reached a similar conclusion , saying swedish energy company vattenfall could not transfer energy output from muehlheim-kaerlich , where it also has a power plant , to a power plant in brunsbüttel . each nuclear power plant 's remaining operational time is measured in terms of the amount of power it is allowed to generate .

had it been approved , the transfer would have kept the biblis a plant open through federal elections in 2009 . rwe said wednesday , feb .

the german government 's crackdown on tax evaders comes courtesy of stolen bank data , for which germany 's intelligence service , the bnd , paid millions .
but now many have begun to ask : does the end justify the means ? investigators probing the scale of tax evasion by germans have already uncovered some 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in funds stashed in trusts in liechtenstein - and that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
by the time investigators have finished , the 4.2 million euros paid to an informant alleged to have stolen client data from liechtenstein 's lgt bank in 2002 will look like a bargain-basement price in comparison with the vast sums reclaimed by the german finance ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the data bought by the bnd was reportedly stolen from the lgt group in 2002 despite this , the whole affair is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many ordinary germans as well as politicians who take issue with the methods used by the government to obtain the liechtenstein bank data .
a poll showed that 52 percent of voters think the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- should not have paid for the information , while just 41 percent think the payment was justified .
" ordinary germans feel a certain solidarity with the people who are now being investigated for tax evasion , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university .
" on some level , this is something everyone in germany tries to do , whether that involves writing off bigger sums in your tax declaration than you should , getting paid for work that you do n't declare or paying someone to work under the table for you , " he added .
" these people also do n't want to be caught , and so they have something against the government using such methods to pursue tax evaders . "
a great deal or a criminal act ?
the bnd normally has nothing to do with tax matters , but officials say it was offered the information and only acted on it after consulting the government and tax authorities .
a notarized contract for the sum paid to the informant was drawn up , and detailed records were kept every step of the way .
according to finance ministry officials , there 's no doubt that the data will be admissible in court .
finance minister peer steinbrück said he did n't want to imagine the " wave of indignation that would roll through the country " if the bnd had acted any differently .
but ferdinand von schirach , one of two lawyers who have said so far that they plan to sue the german state for its handling of the affair , said the government can not use taxpayers ' money to reward criminal acts - such as the stealing of confidential bank information .
" even though it seems like a great deal … a crime can not be committed , " he told reuters tv .
" if that was the case , the state would be no better than any criminal on the street . "
bnd must answer to parliamentary committee last week , the bnd was asked to brief a parliamentary committee on its methods so that the government could decide whether to approve or disapprove of the liechtenstein operation , but members of the parliamentary intelligence committee deemed more documents were needed .
the next briefing is set for march 5 .
speaking to the berlin-based newspaper , taz , following the initial briefing , green party parliamentarian christian ströbele stressed the need for rule of law , even when it comes to hunting down tax evaders .
" putting aside my joy that the right people are finally being targeted , the law has to be followed here , even against our richest citizens , " ströbele said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neskovic : bnd 's behavior is " clearly illegal " left party parliamentarian wolfgang neskovic was more critical .
" the bnd 's behavior is , in my view , clearly illegal , " he said .
but neskovic doubts whether the parliamentary session on march 5 will lead to any consequences for the intelligence agency .
" in this republic , there are unchecked zones , especially when it comes to the intelligence service , and this has to change , " said neskovic , a former federal court justice .
" what we know of up to now is just a drop , and what we do n't know amounts to an ocean . "
liechtenstein furious over german tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince alois says germany is attacking his nation the acting head of liechtenstein , hereditary prince alois , has described the bnd 's behavior as " highly suspect . "
he said the informant , who has been identified as former lgt bank employee heinrich kieber , had been convicted of stealing bank data in 2002 and imprisoned .
" obviously , germany wants to be a big-time receiver of stolen goods , " he said , also making thinly veiled references to germany 's past aggression in europe .
" we are also a sovereign state and - we hope - do not live in an era where might makes right . "
contributing to the war of words that 's been started with the tiny alpine state , german chancellor angela merkel accused liechtenstein 's banks of " encouraging lawbreaking , " and said that it and other tax havens should " mend their ways " or face the consequences .
swiss banks suspicious of espionage one of the consequences already emerging from the bnd 's liechtenstein operation is that germans applying for jobs at swiss banks will undergo additional scrutiny in future because of espionage concerns .
the thousands of germans already working in switzerland 's financial industry could also feel the effects of the german government 's crackdown .
the head of switzerland 's private banker 's association , michel derobert , said the methods used by the bnd to obtain the secret banking data from liechtenstein were " reprehensible " and would lead to extra precautions in switzerland to protect client privacy .
germany 's purchase of the data will discourage swiss banks from employing germans , he told the swiss daily le matin . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some government officials and renewable energy experts say he 's needlessly spreading panic . power outages are a common occurrence not just in developing countries .
in the united states , for example , florida residents are still dealing with the chaos resulting from a wide-ranging blackout that affected nearly a million households .
in germany , though , people expect that when they flip a switch or plug in an appliance , power will be in ready supply . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the chaos that hit florida headed across the atlantic ?
this notion was put in doubt on thursday , feb .
28 , when juergen grossmann , the head of german power giant rwe , warned that germany and the rest of europe could experience power outages lasting several days this summer due to a lack of power stations . " power is growing short all over europe because there are not enough power stations , " grossmann told the bild newspaper .
" right now , all we need is the combination of a hot , dry summer and the shutdown of more power stations for maintenance for power security to be endangered . " no energy gap , government says his comments were repudiated on friday by government officials and representatives of some parts of the energy sector . environment ministry spokesman michael schroeren said it would be mistaken for germans to believe that the lights would go out and people would be unable to operate their washing machines due to a lack of power this summer . " all the figures show that there is no reason to speak of an energy gap , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one expert said there 's no reason for germans to stock up on candles schroeren added that while it is true that energy production can be restricted during periods of very hot weather , german citizens generally do not feel the effects . the federal association for hydropower and energy -lrb- bdew -rrb- said that " potential shortages could be the result if many negative factors were to come together at once . " germany 's renewable energy branch reacted with scorn to grossmann 's comments .
the head of the federal association for renewable energy -lrb- bee -rrb- , milan nitzschke , said there are no energy gaps in germany . " this is pure fear-mongering , " he added . competing interests in german " energy mix " there has been ongoing debate in germany about the country 's optimal " energy mix . " germany has committed to a total phase-out of nuclear power by 2020 and to increasing the proportion of energy that comes from renewable sources .
chancellor angela merkel , however , has spoken out for an energy mix that includes nuclear power , as well as more energy generated by coal-fired power stations . merkel 's government plans to build up to 25 new coal-fired plants in order to fill the gap left when nuclear plants are taken offline .
the plans have met with enormous resistance from environmental groups and citizens ' initiatives who see the plans as a backwards step for a country that is meant to be assuming a leading role worldwide in the promotion of clean energy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the scene spawned a generation of anarcho-punks , making the city a counter-cultural haven .
few know that it also spawned the current chancellor . from one-time revolutionary joschka fischer to former raf defense lawyer otto schily , a rebellious youth seems to be a rite-of-passage for german politicians .
those two went on to become the last german administration 's foreign and interior ministers . until now , however , no one ever suspected that chancellor angela merkel boasts equally street-smart credentials . a woman who looks as though she would n't even risk jaywalking , merkel revealed in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's magazine to be published friday , feb .
28 , that as a veteran of the infamous berlin squat scene , she too once enjoyed a spell on society 's margins . during her 20s , she explained , she lived illegally in an apartment in the district of mitte , a now gentrified neighborhood in the heart of what was once communist east berlin . apparently , she had struggled to find accommodation when she moved to berlin from leipzig with her first husband in 1978 to work in a science institute .
so what 's a girl to do but reach for the nearest crowbar ? radical chic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a far cry from the german chancellery others might have resorted to scanning the classifieds , but communist east germany raised its citizens to get their hands dirty .
it 's hard to imagine her western colleagues , such as prissy family minister ursula von der leyen , taking similar action - let alone gym-lovin ' condoleezza rice or ultra-groomed hillary clinton , who would surely balk at the lack of running water , outside toilets and hungry rodents that are par for the course in the average squat .
but merkel , the first german chancellor to have grown up in the gdr , is made of sterner stuff .
and unlike in the west , squatting in east berlin did n't necessarily entail endless cans of beer , dogs on strings and torn leather jackets . it just meant moving into a vacant apartment .
" the state renting agency was no longer aware of which buildings were empty and which were n't , " she said .
" i took advantage of their confusion out of desperation . "
but while her peers on the other side of the berlin wall saw squatting as a rejection of mainstream society , indulging in free love , experimenting with drugs and never failing to play their music really loud , merkel the pastor 's daughter made sure she paid rent .
" i simply transferred money to the state renting agency , " she said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neskovic : bnd 's behavior is " clearly illegal " left party parliamentarian wolfgang neskovic was more critical .
" the bnd 's behavior is , in my view , clearly illegal , " he said .
but neskovic doubts whether the parliamentary session on march 5 will lead to any consequences for the intelligence agency .
" in this republic , there are unchecked zones , especially when it comes to the intelligence service , and this has to change , " said neskovic , a former federal court justice .

liechtenstein furious over german tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince alois says germany is attacking his nation the acting head of liechtenstein , hereditary prince alois , has described the bnd 's behavior as " highly suspect . "
he said the informant , who has been identified as former lgt bank employee heinrich kieber , had been convicted of stealing bank data in 2002 and imprisoned .
" obviously , germany wants to be a big-time receiver of stolen goods , " he said , also making thinly veiled references to germany 's past aggression in europe .
" we are also a sovereign state and - we hope - do not live in an era where might makes right . "
contributing to the war of words that 's been started with the tiny alpine state , german chancellor angela merkel accused liechtenstein 's banks of " encouraging lawbreaking , " and said that it and other tax havens should " mend their ways " or face the consequences .
swiss banks suspicious of espionage one of the consequences already emerging from the bnd 's liechtenstein operation is that germans applying for jobs at swiss banks will undergo additional scrutiny in future because of espionage concerns .
the thousands of germans already working in switzerland 's financial industry could also feel the effects of the german government 's crackdown .
the head of switzerland 's private banker 's association , michel derobert , said the methods used by the bnd to obtain the secret banking data from liechtenstein were " reprehensible " and would lead to extra precautions in switzerland to protect client privacy .
germany 's purchase of the data will discourage swiss banks from employing germans , he told the swiss daily le matin . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

apart from irritating the french , he 's been ruffling feathers abroad - most recently in berlin . scheduling difficulties - this diplomatic euphemism was the official reason from paris for letting two franco-german meetings slip through the cracks this week . french finance minister christine lagarde should have been received by her german counterpart , peer steinbrueck , on tuesday , feb .
26 , but le president had something else in mind : he took the minister on a trip to visit businesses in the countryside .
after all , local elections take place on march 9 and 16 , so bilateral relations apparently have to take a backseat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are n't quite so amicable right now several days ago , sarkozy postponed a march 3 meeting with chancellor angela merkel by three months .
the unofficial summit had been planned far in advance . " club med " concerns chancellor at the diplomatic level , the cancellations are brushed off as inconsequential .
but it 's no a secret that ties between paris and berlin are n't exactly close .
the german chancellor is still disgruntled about sarkozy 's mediterranean union initative .
originally conceived as a kind of consolation prize for turkey , which sarkozy does n't want in the eu , it 's become a serious project for the french president . germany , however , is worried that france is splitting the eu and looking to take a leadership role in europe .
and sarkozy 's invitation to the mediterranean heads of state to visit paris on july 13 - one day before the rest of the eu heads of state arrive to celebrate france taking over the eu presidency - did nothing to dispel concerns . berlin is not alone in its irritation with the french president , who took office in may last year . broken promises , tactless plans in january of this year , he promised french fishermen that he would do away with fishing quotas when his country assumes the eu presidency on july 1 .
but just a few weeks earlier , france had signed a fishing regulation law .
agriculture minister michel barnier was hard-pressed to calm the ensuing storm of protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france does n't want turkey in the eu but suggested an association treaty for ukraine in early february , eu commission president jose manuel barroso reprimanded the french government for not making enough of an effort to economize . also at the beginning of the month , french diplomats came up with the idea of an association treaty with ukraine at a time when , according to the german weekly die zeit , speculations over an eastward eu expansion are taboo . what 's more , french-speakers in switzerland , canada and belgium are furious that sarkozy wants to integrate broadcaster tv 5 monde in a purely french holding company .
the partner countries own a one-third share in the francophone broadcaster . distracted by local campaign but any judgements on sarkozy 's foreign policy should take into account that he 's under significant pressure abroad , said the director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg , frank baasner . " there are just a few weeks until the local elections , " said baasner .
" if his party suffers a setback , his popularity will be completely lost . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france takes over the eu presidency in july " france 's foreign policy is domestic policy , for the time being . " in de gaulle 's footsteps sarkozy is not the first president to be accused of going it alone or displaying his omnipotence .
charles de gaulle , the resistance general and post-war president made france into a nuclear power independent of the united states .
in 1962 , he called for a " europe of fatherlands " led by france . baasner pointed to the continuity between de gaulle and sarkozy .
the idea that europe is an extension of france is deeply rooted in the french consciousness , he said . but france 's current president also has his own style , said baasner .
" what surprises even the french is the coolness , the near aggressiveness of his style . " that aggressiveness was most recently on display earlier this week when , during a visit to a paris agricultural fair , sarkozy insulted a bystander who refused to shake his hand , telling the man to " get lost , " followed by some choice french expletives . nevertheless , many european leaders have had to go through crises before finally becoming grounded .
sarkozy - and france - may just have to prepare for a process of refinement " through the power of reality , " baasner said . andreas leixnering -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the scene spawned a generation of anarcho-punks , making the city a counter-cultural haven .
few know that it also spawned the current chancellor . from one-time revolutionary joschka fischer to former raf defense lawyer otto schily , a rebellious youth seems to be a rite-of-passage for german politicians .
those two went on to become the last german administration 's foreign and interior ministers . until now , however , no one ever suspected that chancellor angela merkel boasts equally street-smart credentials . a woman who looks as though she would n't even risk jaywalking , merkel revealed in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung 's magazine to be published friday , feb .
28 , that as a veteran of the infamous berlin squat scene , she too once enjoyed a spell on society 's margins . during her 20s , she explained , she lived illegally in an apartment in the district of mitte , a now gentrified neighborhood in the heart of what was once communist east berlin . apparently , she had struggled to find accommodation when she moved to berlin from leipzig with her first husband in 1978 to work in a science institute .
so what 's a girl to do but reach for the nearest crowbar ? radical chic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a far cry from the german chancellery others might have resorted to scanning the classifieds , but communist east germany raised its citizens to get their hands dirty .
it 's hard to imagine her western colleagues , such as prissy family minister ursula von der leyen , taking similar action - let alone gym-lovin ' condoleezza rice or ultra-groomed hillary clinton , who would surely balk at the lack of running water , outside toilets and hungry rodents that are par for the course in the average squat .
but merkel , the first german chancellor to have grown up in the gdr , is made of sterner stuff .
and unlike in the west , squatting in east berlin did n't necessarily entail endless cans of beer , dogs on strings and torn leather jackets . it just meant moving into a vacant apartment .
" the state renting agency was no longer aware of which buildings were empty and which were n't , " she said .
" i took advantage of their confusion out of desperation . "
but while her peers on the other side of the berlin wall saw squatting as a rejection of mainstream society , indulging in free love , experimenting with drugs and never failing to play their music really loud , merkel the pastor 's daughter made sure she paid rent .
" i simply transferred money to the state renting agency , " she said .
" at the time all money was most welcome . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the show premieres in spain on thursday , feb .
28 . millions of people have read her diary ; numerous films have been made about her life in hiding from the nazis . at first glance , though , the story of anne frank , the young jewish girl forced into hiding for two years before finally meeting her death in a nazi concentration camp , does n't necessarily seem to lend itself to a musical format . but the musical has indeed taken the stage - " anne frank : a song to life , " which is more of a tragic opera , premieres in madrid 's haagen-dazs calderon theater on feb .
28 . the story centers around the diary , which anne received for her 13th birthday and which she named " kitty . " in the musical , smoke fills the stage floor as kitty enters as a glamorous woman dressed in glittering red .
the vision is a personification of young anne 's dreams of womanhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the diary is n't quoted directly in the musical spanish director rafael alvero said he got the idea 10 years ago when he was working in amsterdam and had a chance to visit the house where anne frank hid with her family from the nazis . " i felt i would one day bring the feelings , which the place and the story evoke , to the public through something i do with ease , which is produce music , " alvero told afp news agency . history vs. entertainment yet the musical sparked an international controversy over what critics said was a frivolous treatment of the story of a girl who died in the holocaust . anne frank 's oldest living relative , her 82-year-old cousin buddy elias , was fiercely opposed to the idea of the jewish girl 's story being presented as entertainment . he heads the swiss-based anne frank fonds , which holds exclusive publishing rights to her diary .
however , the organization could not take legal action against alvero because the diary is not directly quoted in the musical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne kept up her schoolwork while in hiding until his death in 1980 , anne frank 's father , otto frank , had refused to allow any artistic adaptations of his daughter 's diary . the anne frank foundation , which runs a museum in amsterdam , has , according to otto frank 's wishes , typically been cautious about backing artistic productions based on the girl 's story .
but elias told afp news agency that the fonds had not opposed earlier film , theater and tv adaptations because they were considered " realistic . " serious issues not new to musicals however , after its initial skepticism , the foundation threw its full support behind alvero and worked closely with him to ensure historical accuracy .
the director convinced the foundation with " his quality of work and high standards , " jan erik dubbelman , the international director , told spiegel online . alvero himself said that the stage adaptation is an effective way to share anne frank 's tragic story .
and since it 's in spanish , it can serve as a vehicle to bring a piece of holocaust history to latin america . he also pointed out that somber topics have been addressed in musicals before , such as in " les miserables " and " jesus christ superstar . " lead actress also lived in hiding anne frank began writing her diary on her 13th birthday in 1942 .
throughout the next two years she described everyday details of life in hiding , giving later generations a unique personal window into the holocaust period . bildunterschrift : anne -lrb- l -rrb- with her sister margot , before going into hiding she and her family were betrayed and arrested in 1944 , when they were deported to the bergen-belsen concentration camp .
anne died of typhus there in 1945 .
since then , her diary has been published in nearly 70 languages . comparisons have been made between anne frank and the 13-year-old girl who portrays her on stage , isabella castillo .
the latter fled cuba with her mother at a young age and the two hid for a time in belize on their way to the us .
that 's where the comparison stops , however . new face appears in another twist to frank 's life story , just this week , it was announced that the face of peter schiff , described as " my one true love " by anne frank in her diary , will be shown to the public for the first time by the anne frank museum in amsterdam . a photo of the boy , who was 13 when his adolescent romance began with then 11-year-old frank , was supplied by childhood friend ernst michaelis , who visited the museum last month with his children and grandchildren and felt he should offer up the picture . dw staff -lrb- als / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

andrew black political reporter , bbc scotland news website when nicol stephen was returned as msp for aberdeen south during election night on 3 may 2007 , he was still scotland 's deputy first minister .
mt stephen aimed for electric performances at question time from the platform , the scottish liberal democrat leader spoke of his determination to deliver his party 's policies in the new scottish parliament .
but something else was transpiring at the aberdeen count .
the snp was making in-roads to the lib dems ' north-east heartland .
mr stephen retained his seat with a 2,732 majority , but suffered an 11.21 % swing to the nationalists .
and snp leader alex salmond claimed the gordon seat from the lib dems .
back at the new holyrood , mr stephen 's party found itself out of power for the first time since devolution in 1999 .
his deal-breaking election campaign stance against independence ruled out any chance of a coalition with the nationalists .
although the lib dems got 75 % of their manifesto through the last parliament , not everyone in the party was happy .
some found being number two in the labour power-sharing deal a bruising experience , and were happy to spend some time in opposition .
the lib dems claimed credit over university funding when it came to the snp 's first budget , the lib dems refused to play the amendment game - but did claim credit after ministers agreed to work with university leaders on funding levels .
in the holyrood chamber the party expressed its concerns - and those of university principals - that higher education had not been given enough cash .
the lib dems , along with other parties , also put enough pressure on the government to increase the recruitment of new police officers and have pressed ministers hard on cutting primary class sizes and abolishing student debt .
but despite several other last minute concessions , they still refused to back the budget , choosing to abstain instead .
they branded mr salmond 's eve-of budget threat to resign if it fell a " landmark strop " - a plan , the party said , to deflect attention away from holes in the £ 30bn spending plans , including detail on how ministers ' ambitious efficiency savings would be achieved .
and then came mr stephen 's gloves-off approach to first minister 's question time - most notably his assertion that the scottish government 's involvement with donald trump 's £ 1bn north east golf resort plan " smelled of sleaze " .
the menie estate plans were called in by ministers after being narrowly rejected by an aberdeenshire council committee .
scotland 's top civil servant , sir john elvidge , ruled civil servants played by the rules .
time will tell if mr stephen will end up having to eat his words .
mr stephen made strong comments on the trump application perhaps of more immediate concern was the rejection of development on the casting vote of aberdeenshire council 's infrastructure convener - lib dem councillor martin ford - even though the resort was largely supported by the council .
mr ford was sacked from the role and later claimed his party was carrying out a " witch hunt " against him .
despite jack mcconnell 's resignation as labour leader after his reign as scotland 's longest-serving first minister , mr stephen decided to stay on and lead the party at holyrood , slimmed down by one msp to 16 after polling day .
and the liberal democrats have experienced bittersweet fortunes on a uk level - the party 's hammer blow victory against labour in the dunfermline and west fife by-election came before the resignation of sir menzies campbell - also a fife mp - as leader .
if liberal democrat msps and the party faithful want a headline-grabbing leadership which can lobby the government for change on key issues , they have it in mr stephen .
if they want to bring the party back into government - maybe he will need to produce something more .

andrew black political reporter , bbc scotland news website when nicol stephen was returned as msp for aberdeen south during election night on 3 may 2007 , he was still scotland 's deputy first minister .
from the platform , the scottish liberal democrat leader spoke of his determination to deliver his party 's policies in the new scottish parliament .
but something else was transpiring at the aberdeen count .
the snp was making in-roads to the lib dems ' north-east heartland .
mr stephen retained his seat with a 2,732 majority , but suffered an 11.21 % swing to the nationalists .
and snp leader alex salmond claimed the gordon seat from the lib dems .
back at the new holyrood , mr stephen 's party found itself out of power for the first time since devolution in 1999 .
his deal-breaking election campaign stance against independence ruled out any chance of a coalition with the nationalists .
although the lib dems got 75 % of their manifesto through the last parliament , not everyone in the party was happy .
some found being number two in the labour power-sharing deal a bruising experience , and were happy to spend some time in opposition .
when it came to the snp 's first budget , the lib dems refused to play the amendment game - but did claim credit after ministers agreed to work with university leaders on funding levels .
in the holyrood chamber the party expressed its concerns - and those of university principals - that higher education had not been given enough cash .
the lib dems , along with other parties , also put enough pressure on the government to increase the recruitment of new police officers and have pressed ministers hard on cutting primary class sizes and abolishing student debt .
but despite several other last minute concessions , they still refused to back the budget , choosing to abstain instead .
they branded mr salmond 's eve-of budget threat to resign if it fell a " landmark strop " - a plan , the party said , to deflect attention away from holes in the £ 30bn spending plans , including detail on how ministers ' ambitious efficiency savings would be achieved .
and then came mr stephen 's gloves-off approach to first minister 's question time - most notably his assertion that the scottish government 's involvement with donald trump 's £ 1bn north east golf resort plan " smelled of sleaze " .
the menie estate plans were called in by ministers after being narrowly rejected by an aberdeenshire council committee .
scotland 's top civil servant , sir john elvidge , ruled civil servants played by the rules .
time will tell if mr stephen will end up having to eat his words .
perhaps of more immediate concern was the rejection of development on the casting vote of aberdeenshire council 's infrastructure convener - lib dem councillor martin ford - even though the resort was largely supported by the council .
mr ford was sacked from the role and later claimed his party was carrying out a " witch hunt " against him .
despite jack mcconnell 's resignation as labour leader after his reign as scotland 's longest-serving first minister , mr stephen decided to stay on and lead the party at holyrood , slimmed down by one msp to 16 after polling day .
and the liberal democrats have experienced bittersweet fortunes on a uk level - the party 's hammer blow victory against labour in the dunfermline and west fife by-election came before the resignation of sir menzies campbell - also a fife mp - as leader .
if liberal democrat msps and the party faithful want a headline-grabbing leadership which can lobby the government for change on key issues , they have it in mr stephen .
if they want to bring the party back into government - maybe he will need to produce something more .

a spin-off company , demasq ltd , has been launched to produce the technology by next year , based on work by one of the university 's bioscience professors .
the imaging software aims to combine the detail provided by an mri scanner with conventional x-rays .
knee specialists in cardiff and the us have been advising on the research .
the soft tissues which have been invisible in the past are exactly the ones where most disease processes occur prof hechmi toumi the degenerative knee indicator -lrb- dki -rrb- aims to provide medical teams with a combination of tissue detail - which can be achieved by a more expensive mri scanner - with the bone detail of an x-ray .
ordinary x-rays can show doctors a picture of what is happening to the knee bone but do not show the joint 's surface or the soft tissue surrounding it .
the new imagery looks to enhance x-rays to show cartilage and other non-bony structures .
' revolutionary method ' prof hechmi toumi , on whose work at the muscle-bone-tendon unit of cardiff university 's school of biosciences the project is based , said it promised " to alter our perception of the conventional use of x-rays " .
he said the dki enabled doctors to examine the health of soft tissues and aimed to provide the technology at lower cost .
" the soft tissues which have been invisible in the past are exactly the ones where most disease processes occur , " he said .
prof toumi , who is a former french international long jumper , has been advised in his work by university hospital of wales surgeon and knee specialist prof john fairclough and doctors in the united states .
prof fairclough said it offered the medical world " a revolutionary method " of viewing conventional x-rays .
" this exciting invention will potentially offer that rare combination of providing new information to clinicians to help patients while potentially reducing the cost to the health service , " he said .
demasq has been formed out of a link-up with biofusion , a development company which has partnerships with university teams at cardiff and sheffield .
david baynes , chief executive of biofusion said they were " very excited " about the technology and had invested an initial £ 450,000 ahead of the product 's launch next year .
he said it had the " potential to revolutionise the diagnosis of knee problems for patients " .

he has served in a number of government roles as part of his party 's coalition with scottish labour , including transport minister .
here , is a selection of the things he has said .
free school meals -lrb- june 2002 -rrb- " i 'm simply saying that at this present time we do n't have £ 170m to introduce free school meals .
" what we do want to do , though , is a series of more targeted measures that will achieve a lot of the outcomes that finland has achieved .
" there is no doubting the fact that scotland remains the unhealthy person of europe and also the unhealthy young person of europe and we need to do more . "
free school meals move fails the ' 3 rs ' -lrb- june 2002 -rrb- " many young people are turned off by politics and feel alienated from society .
" education for citizenship helps children to learn about political , economic , social and cultural issues .
it focuses on the ' 3 rs ' - rights , responsibilities and respect . "
' good citizen ' lessons on agenda skye bridge toll abolition -lrb- december 2004 -rrb- " this is a historic day for everyone on skye .
" we made a commitment last year to end the tolls on skye bridge .
today that promise has been delivered .
the abolition of tolls sweeps away a source of deep division and genuine injustice .
" today we are sweeping away one of the last vestiges of the conservative era , this first pfi contract that sought to put so much of the cost on to the local people of skye and lochalsh . "
tolls abolished for skye bridge jim wallace to step down -lrb- may 2005 -rrb- " jim wallace has been an outstanding leader .
" he is standing down at the peak of his success .
" perhaps his greatest achievement has been his impact on shaping the new scottish parliament .
" he provided steady leadership to the whole of scotland , more than once during its early turbulent years , which rightly won him great respect from all the parties and from individuals across the country . "
in quotes : jim wallace resigns nicol stephen leader -lrb- june 2005 -rrb- " we are well placed for the future .
we have got great credibility now in terms of the whole of scotland .
" we are reaching out to new parts of scotland .
i believe that credibility built by jim wallace and my colleagues gives us not just a foundation but a springboard and launch pad to greater success in the future . "
" i want us to be seen as pro-education , pro-the economy , pro-business , pro-the environment , " he explained .
" i want our ideas to be radical , responsible and reforming .
" most of all we need to see a positive campaign promoting our policies , not pillorying the personalities of opponents .
" all of us need to be motivated , energised and committed . "
lib dems choose stephen as leader autumn conference speech -lrb- october 2005 -rrb- " it is clear to me that our liberal democrat approach on personal liberty , the environment , international matters and education strike a chord with young people .

aberystwyth 's institute of grassland and environmental research -lrb- iger -rrb- is working on a new variety of the pearl millet plant grown in africa and asia .
in 2005 it developed the plant 's dna to make it more resistant to attack from a disease known as downy mildew .
iger is working with scientists in india and ghana on the latest project .
iger has received a £ 700,000 grant from the biotechnology and biological research council and the uk 's department for international development for the four-year project .
pearl millet is the staple crop grown by farmers in the hottest and driest regions of sub-saharan africa and the indian subcontinent .
' drought tolerance ' but declining water resources and unpredictable rainfall posed serious threats to crop productivity , said dr rattan yadav , who is leading iger 's research team .
" key segments of pearl millet dna are already known to iger scientists and plant breeders in india have already made use of fundamental genetic research carried out at iger over the years , " said dr yadav .
" but declining water resources and unpredictable rainfall now call for further research into efficient breeding for drought-prone environments . "
he said the ultimate aim was to improve farmers ' livelihoods , but to achieve this the " drought tolerance " of pearl millet had to be developed .
gareth thomas , uk minister for international development , said investing in science and research was essential in providing farmers in poor areas with a better life .
" this research , bringing together uk , african and asian scientists , has the potential to revolutionise farming in the developing world and reduce global poverty , " he added .

alistair carmichael won the far-flung westminster seat in 2001 .
it was the same constituency which had been previously held by liberal leader jo grimond and scottish liberal democrat leader jim wallace .
the 42-year-old made a confident start in the house of commons and was appointed a junior liberal democrat spokesman on northern ireland , a shadow spokesman post he continues today .
mr carmichael is also the party 's spokesman on scottish affairs .
a solicitor by profession , he has spoken on law reform but specialises in constituency issues .
he often raises the complex transport needs of his island seat .
in 2005 the married father-of-two moved to the home affairs team .
following the election of sir menzies campbell to leader of the party , mr carmichael was made liberal democrat spokesman for transport .
