freshly minted russian president dimitri medvedev has said he wants to see a stronger role for civil society and to boost the freedom of the russian press - maintaining that this is the only way to stem corruption and cut red tape . now for the bad news .
he also plans to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor vladimir putin , who tended to see electronic media as the long arm of the kremlin .

guaranteeing press freedom at the same time as controlling it is out of the question .
medvedev will have to make a decision .
ultimately , he will be judged by his deeds , not his words .
and the 42-year-old president certainly deserves to be given a chance .
if moscow does decide to lift restrictions on television reporting , the move will have repercussions for other countries , including kazakhstan , uzbekistan , azerbaijan and belarus , where russian television is also popular .
a free press in russia would put the media in other cis countries under pressure .
medvedev 's responsibilities therefore extend beyond russia .

the us administration is constantly trying to tighten its grip on the media , especially when it comes to talking up the military situation in afghanistan and iraq .
and the german intelligence service is also treading a fine legal line when it uses the war on terror as an excuse to read journalists ' mail .
clearly , this can not be compared to press persecution in sudan , myanmar and china .
when the german secret service breaches existing laws and human rights , it faces the consequences in full view of the public .
both radio and television cover these incidents extensively , with democratically elected politicians appearing before investigative committees to explain how they could have happened , and secret service officials reprimanded or even fired .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : russia gets a new president profile : dmitry medvedev dealing with medvedev wo n't be easier , putin warns merkel opinion : russia 's power duo offers tenuous political stability europe offers congratulations and criticism to medvedev opinion -pipe- 03.05.2008 opinion : why a free press is n't always popular großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictatorships around the world impose restrictions on press freedom as a way of resisting change , but as dw 's miodrag soric points out on world press day , the western world is n't beyond reproach either . first the good news .
freshly minted russian president dimitri medvedev has said he wants to see a stronger role for civil society and to boost the freedom of the russian press - maintaining that this is the only way to stem corruption and cut red tape . now for the bad news .
he also plans to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor vladimir putin , who tended to see electronic media as the long arm of the kremlin .
he ca n't do both .
guaranteeing press freedom at the same time as controlling it is out of the question .
medvedev will have to make a decision .
ultimately , he will be judged by his deeds , not his words .
and the 42-year-old president certainly deserves to be given a chance .
if moscow does decide to lift restrictions on television reporting , the move will have repercussions for other countries , including kazakhstan , uzbekistan , azerbaijan and belarus , where russian television is also popular .
a free press in russia would put the media in other cis countries under pressure .
medvedev 's responsibilities therefore extend beyond russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miodrag soric authoritarian regimes across the world fear change , which is why they persecute independent reporters .
the president of zimbabwe , robert mugabe , clamps down on any journalist who speaks out about the country 's economic devastation , its international isolation and disastrous leadership .
other dictators in africa , asia and eastern europe operate the same way .
but on world press day , it is important to remember that the western world is not immune to these practices , either .
the us administration is constantly trying to tighten its grip on the media , especially when it comes to talking up the military situation in afghanistan and iraq .
and the german intelligence service is also treading a fine legal line when it uses the war on terror as an excuse to read journalists ' mail .
clearly , this can not be compared to press persecution in sudan , myanmar and china .
when the german secret service breaches existing laws and human rights , it faces the consequences in full view of the public .
both radio and television cover these incidents extensively , with democratically elected politicians appearing before investigative committees to explain how they could have happened , and secret service officials reprimanded or even fired .
it 's a different story with dictatorships , where the secret services work on behalf of the government when they go after the press .
take china .
most people here can not believe that in other countries , the press is free of state influence .
when us and british reporters make mistakes in their coverage of the unrest in tibet , chinese users immediately suspect that the errors are symptomatic of a western conspiracy .
they believe that the us and the eu resent china 's economic boom , when it fact , the opposite is true - the industrialized world can only benefit from a wealthier china and the vast new market is represents .
but what it true is that western journalists make errors , as they have done in their coverage of events in tibet .
but to assume this is evidence of an international vendetta against china points either to ignorance , an excessive sense of nationalism or an inferiority complex - or a blend of all three .
the chinese public would be much better informed if the country enjoyed freedom of the press .
but as in any dictatorship , the communists in beijing are terrified of politically aware citizens , open discussion , criticism and press freedom .
change is the last thing they want .
after all , they want to stay in power .

freshly minted russian president dimitri medvedev has said he wants to see a stronger role for civil society and to boost the freedom of the russian press - maintaining that this is the only way to stem corruption and cut red tape . now for the bad news .

if moscow does decide to lift restrictions on television reporting , the move will have repercussions for other countries , including kazakhstan , uzbekistan , azerbaijan and belarus , where russian television is also popular .

clearly , this can not be compared to press persecution in sudan , myanmar and china .
when the german secret service breaches existing laws and human rights , it faces the consequences in full view of the public .
both radio and television cover these incidents extensively , with democratically elected politicians appearing before investigative committees to explain how they could have happened , and secret service officials reprimanded or even fired .

when us and british reporters make mistakes in their coverage of the unrest in tibet , chinese users immediately suspect that the errors are symptomatic of a western conspiracy .
they believe that the us and the eu resent china 's economic boom , when it fact , the opposite is true - the industrialized world can only benefit from a wealthier china and the vast new market is represents .
but what it true is that western journalists make errors , as they have done in their coverage of events in tibet .
but to assume this is evidence of an international vendetta against china points either to ignorance , an excessive sense of nationalism or an inferiority complex - or a blend of all three .
the chinese public would be much better informed if the country enjoyed freedom of the press .
but as in any dictatorship , the communists in beijing are terrified of politically aware citizens , open discussion , criticism and press freedom .
change is the last thing they want .
after all , they want to stay in power .

freshly minted russian president dimitri medvedev has said he wants to see a stronger role for civil society and to boost the freedom of the russian press - maintaining that this is the only way to stem corruption and cut red tape . now for the bad news .
he also plans to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor vladimir putin , who tended to see electronic media as the long arm of the kremlin .
he ca n't do both .
guaranteeing press freedom at the same time as controlling it is out of the question .
medvedev will have to make a decision .
ultimately , he will be judged by his deeds , not his words .
and the 42-year-old president certainly deserves to be given a chance .
if moscow does decide to lift restrictions on television reporting , the move will have repercussions for other countries , including kazakhstan , uzbekistan , azerbaijan and belarus , where russian television is also popular .
a free press in russia would put the media in other cis countries under pressure .
medvedev 's responsibilities therefore extend beyond russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miodrag soric authoritarian regimes across the world fear change , which is why they persecute independent reporters .
the president of zimbabwe , robert mugabe , clamps down on any journalist who speaks out about the country 's economic devastation , its international isolation and disastrous leadership .
other dictators in africa , asia and eastern europe operate the same way .
but on world press day , it is important to remember that the western world is not immune to these practices , either .
the us administration is constantly trying to tighten its grip on the media , especially when it comes to talking up the military situation in afghanistan and iraq .
and the german intelligence service is also treading a fine legal line when it uses the war on terror as an excuse to read journalists ' mail .
clearly , this can not be compared to press persecution in sudan , myanmar and china .
when the german secret service breaches existing laws and human rights , it faces the consequences in full view of the public .
both radio and television cover these incidents extensively , with democratically elected politicians appearing before investigative committees to explain how they could have happened , and secret service officials reprimanded or even fired .
it 's a different story with dictatorships , where the secret services work on behalf of the government when they go after the press .
take china .
most people here can not believe that in other countries , the press is free of state influence .
when us and british reporters make mistakes in their coverage of the unrest in tibet , chinese users immediately suspect that the errors are symptomatic of a western conspiracy .
they believe that the us and the eu resent china 's economic boom , when it fact , the opposite is true - the industrialized world can only benefit from a wealthier china and the vast new market is represents .
but what it true is that western journalists make errors , as they have done in their coverage of events in tibet .
but to assume this is evidence of an international vendetta against china points either to ignorance , an excessive sense of nationalism or an inferiority complex - or a blend of all three .
the chinese public would be much better informed if the country enjoyed freedom of the press .
but as in any dictatorship , the communists in beijing are terrified of politically aware citizens , open discussion , criticism and press freedom .
change is the last thing they want .
after all , they want to stay in power .

but what it true is that western journalists make errors , as they have done in their coverage of events in tibet .
but to assume this is evidence of an international vendetta against china points either to ignorance , an excessive sense of nationalism or an inferiority complex - or a blend of all three .
the chinese public would be much better informed if the country enjoyed freedom of the press .
but as in any dictatorship , the communists in beijing are terrified of politically aware citizens , open discussion , criticism and press freedom .
change is the last thing they want .
after all , they want to stay in power .

former chancellor gerhard schroeder colored his hair .
current chancellor angela merkel first got a new haircut then had a dress cut with a nearly scandalously plunging neckline . now , it seems , social democratic party leader and rhineland palatinate premier kurt beck may be next in line . at a labor union rally on this week he said he would cut off his beard for " a million euros to a good cause . "
but a state spokesman said saturday , may 3 , that beck 's salt-and-pepper beard - which is admittedly more salt than pepper - may not be so easily had . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are known to take their beards very seriously " both the question and the answer were intended as jokes , " the spokesperson in mainz said . currently suffering from the lowest approval ratings he 's ever received , beck is certainly in need of a new image .
just 23 percent of germans say they are happy with his performance in office . should beck want to avoid the ire of germany 's other politicians looking to make points on the spd leader 's change of heart , he could look to lower saxony premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democratic union . in a bet with a radio talk show host , wulff said he would say goodbye to his new beard if voter turnout at january 's state election did n't reach the same level as 2003 . when interest in choosing the state 's representatives turned out to be tepid , wulff wasted no time in taking the razor to his stubbly facial hair . as yet there has , however , been no word on groups passing the hat for a clean-shaven beck . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both radio and television cover these incidents extensively , with democratically elected politicians appearing before investigative committees to explain how they could have happened , and secret service officials reprimanded or even fired .

former chancellor gerhard schroeder colored his hair .
current chancellor angela merkel first got a new haircut then had a dress cut with a nearly scandalously plunging neckline . now , it seems , social democratic party leader and rhineland palatinate premier kurt beck may be next in line . at a labor union rally on this week he said he would cut off his beard for " a million euros to a good cause .

just 23 percent of germans say they are happy with his performance in office . should beck want to avoid the ire of germany 's other politicians looking to make points on the spd leader 's change of heart , he could look to lower saxony premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democratic union . in a bet with a radio talk show host , wulff said he would say goodbye to his new beard if voter turnout at january 's state election did n't reach the same level as 2003 . when interest in choosing the state 's representatives turned out to be tepid , wulff wasted no time in taking the razor to his stubbly facial hair . as yet there has , however , been no word on groups passing the hat for a clean-shaven beck . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

freshly minted russian president dimitri medvedev has said he wants to see a stronger role for civil society and to boost the freedom of the russian press - maintaining that this is the only way to stem corruption and cut red tape . now for the bad news .
he also plans to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor vladimir putin , who tended to see electronic media as the long arm of the kremlin .

guaranteeing press freedom at the same time as controlling it is out of the question .
medvedev will have to make a decision .
ultimately , he will be judged by his deeds , not his words .
and the 42-year-old president certainly deserves to be given a chance .
if moscow does decide to lift restrictions on television reporting , the move will have repercussions for other countries , including kazakhstan , uzbekistan , azerbaijan and belarus , where russian television is also popular .
a free press in russia would put the media in other cis countries under pressure .
medvedev 's responsibilities therefore extend beyond russia .

and the german intelligence service is also treading a fine legal line when it uses the war on terror as an excuse to read journalists ' mail .
clearly , this can not be compared to press persecution in sudan , myanmar and china .
when the german secret service breaches existing laws and human rights , it faces the consequences in full view of the public .
both radio and television cover these incidents extensively , with democratically elected politicians appearing before investigative committees to explain how they could have happened , and secret service officials reprimanded or even fired .

former chancellor gerhard schroeder colored his hair .
current chancellor angela merkel first got a new haircut then had a dress cut with a nearly scandalously plunging neckline . now , it seems , social democratic party leader and rhineland palatinate premier kurt beck may be next in line . at a labor union rally on this week he said he would cut off his beard for " a million euros to a good cause . "
but a state spokesman said saturday , may 3 , that beck 's salt-and-pepper beard - which is admittedly more salt than pepper - may not be so easily had . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are known to take their beards very seriously " both the question and the answer were intended as jokes , " the spokesperson in mainz said . currently suffering from the lowest approval ratings he 's ever received , beck is certainly in need of a new image .
just 23 percent of germans say they are happy with his performance in office . should beck want to avoid the ire of germany 's other politicians looking to make points on the spd leader 's change of heart , he could look to lower saxony premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democratic union . in a bet with a radio talk show host , wulff said he would say goodbye to his new beard if voter turnout at january 's state election did n't reach the same level as 2003 . when interest in choosing the state 's representatives turned out to be tepid , wulff wasted no time in taking the razor to his stubbly facial hair . as yet there has , however , been no word on groups passing the hat for a clean-shaven beck . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

freshly minted russian president dimitri medvedev has said he wants to see a stronger role for civil society and to boost the freedom of the russian press - maintaining that this is the only way to stem corruption and cut red tape . now for the bad news .
he also plans to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor vladimir putin , who tended to see electronic media as the long arm of the kremlin .

medvedev will have to make a decision .

if moscow does decide to lift restrictions on television reporting , the move will have repercussions for other countries , including kazakhstan , uzbekistan , azerbaijan and belarus , where russian television is also popular .
a free press in russia would put the media in other cis countries under pressure .

the us administration is constantly trying to tighten its grip on the media , especially when it comes to talking up the military situation in afghanistan and iraq .
and the german intelligence service is also treading a fine legal line when it uses the war on terror as an excuse to read journalists ' mail .
clearly , this can not be compared to press persecution in sudan , myanmar and china .
when the german secret service breaches existing laws and human rights , it faces the consequences in full view of the public .
both radio and television cover these incidents extensively , with democratically elected politicians appearing before investigative committees to explain how they could have happened , and secret service officials reprimanded or even fired .

medvedev 's responsibilities therefore extend beyond russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miodrag soric authoritarian regimes across the world fear change , which is why they persecute independent reporters .
the president of zimbabwe , robert mugabe , clamps down on any journalist who speaks out about the country 's economic devastation , its international isolation and disastrous leadership .
other dictators in africa , asia and eastern europe operate the same way .
but on world press day , it is important to remember that the western world is not immune to these practices , either .
the us administration is constantly trying to tighten its grip on the media , especially when it comes to talking up the military situation in afghanistan and iraq .
and the german intelligence service is also treading a fine legal line when it uses the war on terror as an excuse to read journalists ' mail .
clearly , this can not be compared to press persecution in sudan , myanmar and china .
when the german secret service breaches existing laws and human rights , it faces the consequences in full view of the public .
both radio and television cover these incidents extensively , with democratically elected politicians appearing before investigative committees to explain how they could have happened , and secret service officials reprimanded or even fired .
it 's a different story with dictatorships , where the secret services work on behalf of the government when they go after the press .
take china .
most people here can not believe that in other countries , the press is free of state influence .
when us and british reporters make mistakes in their coverage of the unrest in tibet , chinese users immediately suspect that the errors are symptomatic of a western conspiracy .
they believe that the us and the eu resent china 's economic boom , when it fact , the opposite is true - the industrialized world can only benefit from a wealthier china and the vast new market is represents .
but what it true is that western journalists make errors , as they have done in their coverage of events in tibet .
but to assume this is evidence of an international vendetta against china points either to ignorance , an excessive sense of nationalism or an inferiority complex - or a blend of all three .
the chinese public would be much better informed if the country enjoyed freedom of the press .
but as in any dictatorship , the communists in beijing are terrified of politically aware citizens , open discussion , criticism and press freedom .
change is the last thing they want .
after all , they want to stay in power .

freshly minted russian president dimitri medvedev has said he wants to see a stronger role for civil society and to boost the freedom of the russian press - maintaining that this is the only way to stem corruption and cut red tape . now for the bad news .
he also plans to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor vladimir putin , who tended to see electronic media as the long arm of the kremlin .
he ca n't do both .
guaranteeing press freedom at the same time as controlling it is out of the question .
medvedev will have to make a decision .
ultimately , he will be judged by his deeds , not his words .
and the 42-year-old president certainly deserves to be given a chance .
if moscow does decide to lift restrictions on television reporting , the move will have repercussions for other countries , including kazakhstan , uzbekistan , azerbaijan and belarus , where russian television is also popular .
a free press in russia would put the media in other cis countries under pressure .
medvedev 's responsibilities therefore extend beyond russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miodrag soric authoritarian regimes across the world fear change , which is why they persecute independent reporters .
the president of zimbabwe , robert mugabe , clamps down on any journalist who speaks out about the country 's economic devastation , its international isolation and disastrous leadership .
other dictators in africa , asia and eastern europe operate the same way .
but on world press day , it is important to remember that the western world is not immune to these practices , either .
the us administration is constantly trying to tighten its grip on the media , especially when it comes to talking up the military situation in afghanistan and iraq .
and the german intelligence service is also treading a fine legal line when it uses the war on terror as an excuse to read journalists ' mail .
clearly , this can not be compared to press persecution in sudan , myanmar and china .
when the german secret service breaches existing laws and human rights , it faces the consequences in full view of the public .
both radio and television cover these incidents extensively , with democratically elected politicians appearing before investigative committees to explain how they could have happened , and secret service officials reprimanded or even fired .
it 's a different story with dictatorships , where the secret services work on behalf of the government when they go after the press .
take china .
most people here can not believe that in other countries , the press is free of state influence .
when us and british reporters make mistakes in their coverage of the unrest in tibet , chinese users immediately suspect that the errors are symptomatic of a western conspiracy .
they believe that the us and the eu resent china 's economic boom , when it fact , the opposite is true - the industrialized world can only benefit from a wealthier china and the vast new market is represents .
but what it true is that western journalists make errors , as they have done in their coverage of events in tibet .
but to assume this is evidence of an international vendetta against china points either to ignorance , an excessive sense of nationalism or an inferiority complex - or a blend of all three .
the chinese public would be much better informed if the country enjoyed freedom of the press .
but as in any dictatorship , the communists in beijing are terrified of politically aware citizens , open discussion , criticism and press freedom .
change is the last thing they want .
after all , they want to stay in power .

former chancellor gerhard schroeder colored his hair .
current chancellor angela merkel first got a new haircut then had a dress cut with a nearly scandalously plunging neckline . now , it seems , social democratic party leader and rhineland palatinate premier kurt beck may be next in line . at a labor union rally on this week he said he would cut off his beard for " a million euros to a good cause . "
but a state spokesman said saturday , may 3 , that beck 's salt-and-pepper beard - which is admittedly more salt than pepper - may not be so easily had . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are known to take their beards very seriously " both the question and the answer were intended as jokes , " the spokesperson in mainz said . currently suffering from the lowest approval ratings he 's ever received , beck is certainly in need of a new image .
just 23 percent of germans say they are happy with his performance in office . should beck want to avoid the ire of germany 's other politicians looking to make points on the spd leader 's change of heart , he could look to lower saxony premier christian wulff , a member of the christian democratic union . in a bet with a radio talk show host , wulff said he would say goodbye to his new beard if voter turnout at january 's state election did n't reach the same level as 2003 . when interest in choosing the state 's representatives turned out to be tepid , wulff wasted no time in taking the razor to his stubbly facial hair . as yet there has , however , been no word on groups passing the hat for a clean-shaven beck . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : russia gets a new president profile : dmitry medvedev dealing with medvedev wo n't be easier , putin warns merkel opinion : russia 's power duo offers tenuous political stability europe offers congratulations and criticism to medvedev opinion -pipe- 03.05.2008 opinion : why a free press is n't always popular großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictatorships around the world impose restrictions on press freedom as a way of resisting change , but as dw 's miodrag soric points out on world press day , the western world is n't beyond reproach either . first the good news .
freshly minted russian president dimitri medvedev has said he wants to see a stronger role for civil society and to boost the freedom of the russian press - maintaining that this is the only way to stem corruption and cut red tape . now for the bad news .
he also plans to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor vladimir putin , who tended to see electronic media as the long arm of the kremlin .
he ca n't do both .
guaranteeing press freedom at the same time as controlling it is out of the question .
medvedev will have to make a decision .
ultimately , he will be judged by his deeds , not his words .
and the 42-year-old president certainly deserves to be given a chance .
if moscow does decide to lift restrictions on television reporting , the move will have repercussions for other countries , including kazakhstan , uzbekistan , azerbaijan and belarus , where russian television is also popular .
a free press in russia would put the media in other cis countries under pressure .
medvedev 's responsibilities therefore extend beyond russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miodrag soric authoritarian regimes across the world fear change , which is why they persecute independent reporters .
the president of zimbabwe , robert mugabe , clamps down on any journalist who speaks out about the country 's economic devastation , its international isolation and disastrous leadership .
other dictators in africa , asia and eastern europe operate the same way .
but on world press day , it is important to remember that the western world is not immune to these practices , either .
the us administration is constantly trying to tighten its grip on the media , especially when it comes to talking up the military situation in afghanistan and iraq .
and the german intelligence service is also treading a fine legal line when it uses the war on terror as an excuse to read journalists ' mail .
clearly , this can not be compared to press persecution in sudan , myanmar and china .
when the german secret service breaches existing laws and human rights , it faces the consequences in full view of the public .
both radio and television cover these incidents extensively , with democratically elected politicians appearing before investigative committees to explain how they could have happened , and secret service officials reprimanded or even fired .
it 's a different story with dictatorships , where the secret services work on behalf of the government when they go after the press .
take china .
most people here can not believe that in other countries , the press is free of state influence .
when us and british reporters make mistakes in their coverage of the unrest in tibet , chinese users immediately suspect that the errors are symptomatic of a western conspiracy .
they believe that the us and the eu resent china 's economic boom , when it fact , the opposite is true - the industrialized world can only benefit from a wealthier china and the vast new market is represents .
but what it true is that western journalists make errors , as they have done in their coverage of events in tibet .
but to assume this is evidence of an international vendetta against china points either to ignorance , an excessive sense of nationalism or an inferiority complex - or a blend of all three .
the chinese public would be much better informed if the country enjoyed freedom of the press .
but as in any dictatorship , the communists in beijing are terrified of politically aware citizens , open discussion , criticism and press freedom .
change is the last thing they want .
after all , they want to stay in power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : russia gets a new president profile : dmitry medvedev dealing with medvedev wo n't be easier , putin warns merkel opinion : russia 's power duo offers tenuous political stability europe offers congratulations and criticism to medvedev opinion -pipe- 03.05.2008 opinion : why a free press is n't always popular großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictatorships around the world impose restrictions on press freedom as a way of resisting change , but as dw 's miodrag soric points out on world press day , the western world is n't beyond reproach either . first the good news .
freshly minted russian president dimitri medvedev has said he wants to see a stronger role for civil society and to boost the freedom of the russian press - maintaining that this is the only way to stem corruption and cut red tape . now for the bad news .
he also plans to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor vladimir putin , who tended to see electronic media as the long arm of the kremlin .
he ca n't do both .
guaranteeing press freedom at the same time as controlling it is out of the question .
medvedev will have to make a decision .
ultimately , he will be judged by his deeds , not his words .
and the 42-year-old president certainly deserves to be given a chance .
if moscow does decide to lift restrictions on television reporting , the move will have repercussions for other countries , including kazakhstan , uzbekistan , azerbaijan and belarus , where russian television is also popular .
a free press in russia would put the media in other cis countries under pressure .
medvedev 's responsibilities therefore extend beyond russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miodrag soric authoritarian regimes across the world fear change , which is why they persecute independent reporters .
the president of zimbabwe , robert mugabe , clamps down on any journalist who speaks out about the country 's economic devastation , its international isolation and disastrous leadership .
other dictators in africa , asia and eastern europe operate the same way .
but on world press day , it is important to remember that the western world is not immune to these practices , either .
the us administration is constantly trying to tighten its grip on the media , especially when it comes to talking up the military situation in afghanistan and iraq .
and the german intelligence service is also treading a fine legal line when it uses the war on terror as an excuse to read journalists ' mail .
clearly , this can not be compared to press persecution in sudan , myanmar and china .
when the german secret service breaches existing laws and human rights , it faces the consequences in full view of the public .
both radio and television cover these incidents extensively , with democratically elected politicians appearing before investigative committees to explain how they could have happened , and secret service officials reprimanded or even fired .
it 's a different story with dictatorships , where the secret services work on behalf of the government when they go after the press .

former chancellor gerhard schroeder colored his hair .
current chancellor angela merkel first got a new haircut then had a dress cut with a nearly scandalously plunging neckline . now , it seems , social democratic party leader and rhineland palatinate premier kurt beck may be next in line . at a labor union rally on this week he said he would cut off his beard for " a million euros to a good cause .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : russia gets a new president profile : dmitry medvedev dealing with medvedev wo n't be easier , putin warns merkel opinion : russia 's power duo offers tenuous political stability europe offers congratulations and criticism to medvedev opinion -pipe- 03.05.2008 opinion : why a free press is n't always popular großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictatorships around the world impose restrictions on press freedom as a way of resisting change , but as dw 's miodrag soric points out on world press day , the western world is n't beyond reproach either . first the good news .
freshly minted russian president dimitri medvedev has said he wants to see a stronger role for civil society and to boost the freedom of the russian press - maintaining that this is the only way to stem corruption and cut red tape . now for the bad news .
he also plans to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor vladimir putin , who tended to see electronic media as the long arm of the kremlin .
he ca n't do both .
guaranteeing press freedom at the same time as controlling it is out of the question .
medvedev will have to make a decision .
ultimately , he will be judged by his deeds , not his words .
and the 42-year-old president certainly deserves to be given a chance .
if moscow does decide to lift restrictions on television reporting , the move will have repercussions for other countries , including kazakhstan , uzbekistan , azerbaijan and belarus , where russian television is also popular .
a free press in russia would put the media in other cis countries under pressure .
medvedev 's responsibilities therefore extend beyond russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miodrag soric authoritarian regimes across the world fear change , which is why they persecute independent reporters .
the president of zimbabwe , robert mugabe , clamps down on any journalist who speaks out about the country 's economic devastation , its international isolation and disastrous leadership .
other dictators in africa , asia and eastern europe operate the same way .
but on world press day , it is important to remember that the western world is not immune to these practices , either .
the us administration is constantly trying to tighten its grip on the media , especially when it comes to talking up the military situation in afghanistan and iraq .
and the german intelligence service is also treading a fine legal line when it uses the war on terror as an excuse to read journalists ' mail .
clearly , this can not be compared to press persecution in sudan , myanmar and china .
when the german secret service breaches existing laws and human rights , it faces the consequences in full view of the public .
both radio and television cover these incidents extensively , with democratically elected politicians appearing before investigative committees to explain how they could have happened , and secret service officials reprimanded or even fired .
it 's a different story with dictatorships , where the secret services work on behalf of the government when they go after the press .
take china .
most people here can not believe that in other countries , the press is free of state influence .
when us and british reporters make mistakes in their coverage of the unrest in tibet , chinese users immediately suspect that the errors are symptomatic of a western conspiracy .
they believe that the us and the eu resent china 's economic boom , when it fact , the opposite is true - the industrialized world can only benefit from a wealthier china and the vast new market is represents .
but what it true is that western journalists make errors , as they have done in their coverage of events in tibet .
but to assume this is evidence of an international vendetta against china points either to ignorance , an excessive sense of nationalism or an inferiority complex - or a blend of all three .
the chinese public would be much better informed if the country enjoyed freedom of the press .
but as in any dictatorship , the communists in beijing are terrified of politically aware citizens , open discussion , criticism and press freedom .
change is the last thing they want .
after all , they want to stay in power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : russia gets a new president profile : dmitry medvedev dealing with medvedev wo n't be easier , putin warns merkel opinion : russia 's power duo offers tenuous political stability europe offers congratulations and criticism to medvedev opinion -pipe- 03.05.2008 opinion : why a free press is n't always popular großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dictatorships around the world impose restrictions on press freedom as a way of resisting change , but as dw 's miodrag soric points out on world press day , the western world is n't beyond reproach either . first the good news .
freshly minted russian president dimitri medvedev has said he wants to see a stronger role for civil society and to boost the freedom of the russian press - maintaining that this is the only way to stem corruption and cut red tape . now for the bad news .
he also plans to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor vladimir putin , who tended to see electronic media as the long arm of the kremlin .
he ca n't do both .
guaranteeing press freedom at the same time as controlling it is out of the question .
medvedev will have to make a decision .
ultimately , he will be judged by his deeds , not his words .
and the 42-year-old president certainly deserves to be given a chance .
if moscow does decide to lift restrictions on television reporting , the move will have repercussions for other countries , including kazakhstan , uzbekistan , azerbaijan and belarus , where russian television is also popular .
a free press in russia would put the media in other cis countries under pressure .
medvedev 's responsibilities therefore extend beyond russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miodrag soric authoritarian regimes across the world fear change , which is why they persecute independent reporters .
the president of zimbabwe , robert mugabe , clamps down on any journalist who speaks out about the country 's economic devastation , its international isolation and disastrous leadership .
other dictators in africa , asia and eastern europe operate the same way .
but on world press day , it is important to remember that the western world is not immune to these practices , either .
the us administration is constantly trying to tighten its grip on the media , especially when it comes to talking up the military situation in afghanistan and iraq .
and the german intelligence service is also treading a fine legal line when it uses the war on terror as an excuse to read journalists ' mail .
clearly , this can not be compared to press persecution in sudan , myanmar and china .
when the german secret service breaches existing laws and human rights , it faces the consequences in full view of the public .
both radio and television cover these incidents extensively , with democratically elected politicians appearing before investigative committees to explain how they could have happened , and secret service officials reprimanded or even fired .
it 's a different story with dictatorships , where the secret services work on behalf of the government when they go after the press .
take china .
most people here can not believe that in other countries , the press is free of state influence .
when us and british reporters make mistakes in their coverage of the unrest in tibet , chinese users immediately suspect that the errors are symptomatic of a western conspiracy .
they believe that the us and the eu resent china 's economic boom , when it fact , the opposite is true - the industrialized world can only benefit from a wealthier china and the vast new market is represents .
but what it true is that western journalists make errors , as they have done in their coverage of events in tibet .
but to assume this is evidence of an international vendetta against china points either to ignorance , an excessive sense of nationalism or an inferiority complex - or a blend of all three .
the chinese public would be much better informed if the country enjoyed freedom of the press .
but as in any dictatorship , the communists in beijing are terrified of politically aware citizens , open discussion , criticism and press freedom .
change is the last thing they want .
after all , they want to stay in power .

freshly minted russian president dimitri medvedev has said he wants to see a stronger role for civil society and to boost the freedom of the russian press - maintaining that this is the only way to stem corruption and cut red tape . now for the bad news .
he also plans to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor vladimir putin , who tended to see electronic media as the long arm of the kremlin .
he ca n't do both .
guaranteeing press freedom at the same time as controlling it is out of the question .
medvedev will have to make a decision .
ultimately , he will be judged by his deeds , not his words .
and the 42-year-old president certainly deserves to be given a chance .
if moscow does decide to lift restrictions on television reporting , the move will have repercussions for other countries , including kazakhstan , uzbekistan , azerbaijan and belarus , where russian television is also popular .
a free press in russia would put the media in other cis countries under pressure .
medvedev 's responsibilities therefore extend beyond russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miodrag soric authoritarian regimes across the world fear change , which is why they persecute independent reporters .
the president of zimbabwe , robert mugabe , clamps down on any journalist who speaks out about the country 's economic devastation , its international isolation and disastrous leadership .
other dictators in africa , asia and eastern europe operate the same way .
but on world press day , it is important to remember that the western world is not immune to these practices , either .
the us administration is constantly trying to tighten its grip on the media , especially when it comes to talking up the military situation in afghanistan and iraq .
and the german intelligence service is also treading a fine legal line when it uses the war on terror as an excuse to read journalists ' mail .
clearly , this can not be compared to press persecution in sudan , myanmar and china .
when the german secret service breaches existing laws and human rights , it faces the consequences in full view of the public .
both radio and television cover these incidents extensively , with democratically elected politicians appearing before investigative committees to explain how they could have happened , and secret service officials reprimanded or even fired .
it 's a different story with dictatorships , where the secret services work on behalf of the government when they go after the press .
take china .
most people here can not believe that in other countries , the press is free of state influence .
when us and british reporters make mistakes in their coverage of the unrest in tibet , chinese users immediately suspect that the errors are symptomatic of a western conspiracy .
they believe that the us and the eu resent china 's economic boom , when it fact , the opposite is true - the industrialized world can only benefit from a wealthier china and the vast new market is represents .
but what it true is that western journalists make errors , as they have done in their coverage of events in tibet .
but to assume this is evidence of an international vendetta against china points either to ignorance , an excessive sense of nationalism or an inferiority complex - or a blend of all three .
the chinese public would be much better informed if the country enjoyed freedom of the press .
but as in any dictatorship , the communists in beijing are terrified of politically aware citizens , open discussion , criticism and press freedom .
change is the last thing they want .
after all , they want to stay in power .

excitement because of the expectation that the sacked judges may actually take their seats on the bench on the designated date , 12 may .
but there are also fears that this may start a confrontation between the ruling alliance and president musharraf , who is armed with powers to sack the government .
both expectations may be exaggerated .
regarding the restoration of judges , one of the two main coalition leaders and chief of pakistan muslim league nawaz -lrb- pml-n -rrb- , nawaz sharif , believes it will happen on 12 may .
" there will be a resolution in the parliament , which will provide the basis for an official notification , to be issued the same day , and god willing , the judges sacked illegally by musharraf will stand restored , " he told the media on friday .
injunction risk but some observers believe it may not be that simple .
" people want the activation , not just restoration , of the -lrb- sacked -rrb- judges , " former information minister and a loyalist of president musharraf , shaikh rashid ahmed , told a dawn news television interviewer .
" this does not seem possible on 12 may , " he said .
mr ahmed 's views are in line with general observations that the court may order an injunction against such a move .
some observers say the incumbent chief justice - who stands to lose his position if the sacked chief justice , iftikhar chaudhry , is reinstated - may be motivated to issue such injunction .
judges whose current seniority would be affected in the event of the restoration would also have a similar motive , they say .
this could open the floodgates for litigation involving the legality of everything that has happened in the country since 3 november , when president musharraf sacked the judges and imposed emergency rule .
even if the incumbent judges cave in before the popular mandate of the ruling coalition , there are legal questions that will have to be addressed .
mr sharif admitted that under pressure from pakistan peoples party -lrb- ppp -rrb- , the larger party in the coalition , he had agreed that the incumbent judges , who replaced the sacked judges on 3 november , should not be sacked .
apparently , this would increase the number of judges far beyond the one stipulated by a law called the judges act .
mr sharif said that a committee of legal experts , headed by farooq naek , the federal law minister and a member of the ppp , had been constituted to iron out legal complications in this regard .
isolated president on his part , mr naek said in a televised comment that the process may take longer .
" we will try to finish the job as early as possible , but there is no harm if the -lsb- actual -rsb- restoration of the judges goes beyond 12 may " .
meanwhile , president musharraf , who is said to be the actual target of this move , is yet to react publicly .
inside the presidency , however , he has been meeting his political allies , notably the leaders of pakistan muslim league quaid -lrb- pml-q -rrb- , with an apparent aim to assess the situation and formulate a response .
mr musharraf fears that the reinstatement of the judges may ultimately lead to his impeachment by the parliament .
lately , many analysts and politicians have said that he may be contemplating retaliation .
some have even said that he actually issued veiled warnings to the ppp leadership that if worse comes to worse , he may sack the parliament .
but now that the ruling alliance has announced a date for the judges ' restoration , will he play the cards that he holds ?
many analysts believe that he might blink .
his confrontational attitude in the recent past has led to political instability and has also eroded the benefits of the economic growth that was achieved during the last few years .
this has made him probably the most unpopular leader in pakistan today .
the army , which some observers believe may still support him at a critical time , has publicly distanced itself from politics .
and all the players on the political scene , including the judges , the civil society and the new government , are arrayed against him .
as things stand , he has 10 days to show if he can wriggle out of this isolation .

excitement because of the expectation that the sacked judges may actually take their seats on the bench on the designated date , 12 may .
but there are also fears that this may start a confrontation between the ruling alliance and president musharraf , who is armed with powers to sack the government .
both expectations may be exaggerated .
regarding the restoration of judges , one of the two main coalition leaders and chief of pakistan muslim league nawaz -lrb- pml-n -rrb- , nawaz sharif , believes it will happen on 12 may .
" there will be a resolution in the parliament , which will provide the basis for an official notification , to be issued the same day , and god willing , the judges sacked illegally by musharraf will stand restored , " he told the media on friday .
injunction risk but some observers believe it may not be that simple .
" people want the activation , not just restoration , of the -lrb- sacked -rrb- judges , " former information minister and a loyalist of president musharraf , shaikh rashid ahmed , told a dawn news television interviewer .
" this does not seem possible on 12 may , " he said .
mr ahmed 's views are in line with general observations that the court may order an injunction against such a move .
some observers say the incumbent chief justice - who stands to lose his position if the sacked chief justice , iftikhar chaudhry , is reinstated - may be motivated to issue such injunction .
iftikhar chaudhry became a focus of opposition to mr musharraf judges whose current seniority would be affected in the event of the restoration would also have a similar motive , they say .
this could open the floodgates for litigation involving the legality of everything that has happened in the country since 3 november , when president musharraf sacked the judges and imposed emergency rule .
even if the incumbent judges cave in before the popular mandate of the ruling coalition , there are legal questions that will have to be addressed .
mr sharif admitted that under pressure from pakistan peoples party -lrb- ppp -rrb- , the larger party in the coalition , he had agreed that the incumbent judges , who replaced the sacked judges on 3 november , should not be sacked .
apparently , this would increase the number of judges far beyond the one stipulated by a law called the judges act .
mr sharif said that a committee of legal experts , headed by farooq naek , the federal law minister and a member of the ppp , had been constituted to iron out legal complications in this regard .
isolated president on his part , mr naek said in a televised comment that the process may take longer .
" we will try to finish the job as early as possible , but there is no harm if the -lsb- actual -rsb- restoration of the judges goes beyond 12 may " .
meanwhile , president musharraf , who is said to be the actual target of this move , is yet to react publicly .
inside the presidency , however , he has been meeting his political allies , notably the leaders of pakistan muslim league quaid -lrb- pml-q -rrb- , with an apparent aim to assess the situation and formulate a response .
coalition partners met in dubai to discuss the judges ' fate mr musharraf fears that the reinstatement of the judges may ultimately lead to his impeachment by the parliament .
lately , many analysts and politicians have said that he may be contemplating retaliation .
some have even said that he actually issued veiled warnings to the ppp leadership that if worse comes to worse , he may sack the parliament .
but now that the ruling alliance has announced a date for the judges ' restoration , will he play the cards that he holds ?
many analysts believe that he might blink .
his confrontational attitude in the recent past has led to political instability and has also eroded the benefits of the economic growth that was achieved during the last few years .
this has made him probably the most unpopular leader in pakistan today .
the army , which some observers believe may still support him at a critical time , has publicly distanced itself from politics .
and all the players on the political scene , including the judges , the civil society and the new government , are arrayed against him .
as things stand , he has 10 days to show if he can wriggle out of this isolation .

islwyn mp don touhig said the party had to learn lessons after losing control of six welsh councils .
but mr touhig , a former parliamentary private secretary to mr brown , said the pm could still lead labour to victory .
all other big parties made gains , and tories now have majorities on two welsh councils - the same number as labour .
other councils are likely to be run by coalitions of the other parties .
after the 1999 elections , labour ran nine welsh councils , but it now has a majority in just two - neath port talbot and rhondda cynon taf .
it has lost control of caerphilly , torfaen , blaenau gwent , merthyr tydfil , newport and flintshire .
however , it has regained control of bridgend , where it fell two short of a majority , but struck an informal deal with two independents . "
i think we have to take the message back to government that labour supporters feel disillusioned with some things that have happened " don touhig mp mr touhig , a former wales office and defence minister , said : " we 've taken a pounding .
" the important thing is that labour voters stayed at home or they turned against us .
" we have to listen to that message .
i mean we are serving the people .
that 's the only purpose we 're there .
" and i think we have got a very important message to take back - as a government , as a party in order to proceed for the future . "
he added : " i think we have to take the message back to government that labour supporters feel disillusioned with some things that have happened . "
economic problems mr touhig said mr brown could still give labour a general election win , despite the poor council results .
" i believe labour can win a general election under gordon brown - it could be two years away , " said mr touhig , who was parliamentary private secretary to mr brown after labour 's landslide victory in 1997 .
mr brown 's plight today has been compared by commentators to john major 's when the conservatives suffered a heavy defeat at the 1995 council elections , two years before the tories were thrown out of office .
" the important thing is we 've been very kicked , " said mr touhig .
" our supporters have sent us a message . "
meanwhile , first minister rhodri morgan blamed labour 's worst uk electoral performance in 40 years on economic problems over which it had no control .

islwyn mp don touhig said the party had to learn lessons after losing control of six welsh councils .
but mr touhig , a former parliamentary private secretary to mr brown , said the pm could still lead labour to victory .
all other big parties made gains , and tories now have majorities on two welsh councils - the same number as labour .
other councils are likely to be run by coalitions of the other parties .
after the 1999 elections , labour ran nine welsh councils , but it now has a majority in just two - neath port talbot and rhondda cynon taf .
it has lost control of caerphilly , torfaen , blaenau gwent , merthyr tydfil , newport and flintshire .
however , it has regained control of bridgend , where it fell two short of a majority , but struck an informal deal with two independents .
i think we have to take the message back to government that labour supporters feel disillusioned with some things that have happened don touhig mp mr touhig , a former wales office and defence minister , said : " we 've taken a pounding .
" the important thing is that labour voters stayed at home or they turned against us .
" we have to listen to that message .
i mean we are serving the people .
that 's the only purpose we 're there .
" and i think we have got a very important message to take back - as a government , as a party in order to proceed for the future . "
he added : " i think we have to take the message back to government that labour supporters feel disillusioned with some things that have happened . "
economic problems mr touhig said mr brown could still give labour a general election win , despite the poor council results .
" i believe labour can win a general election under gordon brown - it could be two years away , " said mr touhig , who was parliamentary private secretary to mr brown after labour 's landslide victory in 1997 .
mr brown 's plight today has been compared by commentators to john major 's when the conservatives suffered a heavy defeat at the 1995 council elections , two years before the tories were thrown out of office .
" the important thing is we 've been very kicked , " said mr touhig .
" our supporters have sent us a message . "
meanwhile , first minister rhodri morgan blamed labour 's worst uk electoral performance in 40 years on economic problems over which it had no control .

this year 's festival will start and finish with books from writers linked to the prison .
they will include biographies by a current inmate and a former inmate .

mr florence said it was clear " a lot of good work " was being done in literacy and literature with inmates .
" people have to remember that books are probably a much bigger part of an inmate 's life than they are of other people 's lives , " he said .

after several false starts , the new forces rebels say over the next five months all their soldiers will head to specially prepared sites to disarm .
they will then rejoin civilian life or join a new joint national army .
the conflict started in september 2002 when disgruntled soldiers took control of the north after a failed coup .
cpl nanu djeniba was one of the first ex-fighters to receive her official certificate of disarmament , saying she was no longer part of the new forces rebellion .
she said she was pleased the war was over .
" everything that happened , it makes up our memories .
the deaths of brothers and sisters - it 's still something we dwell on long afterwards .
these are the memories we 'll keep .
" now i 'm preparing for the future - i 'm going to go into commerce - i 'm going to sell manioc with some other ex-combatants . "
new phase cpl djeniba has chosen to head back into civilian life with support to set up a business .
she will now hand in her weapon , receive disarmament payments of just over $ 200 -lrb- £ 100 -rrb- a month for the next three months , and enter a training programme for her new life .
others have chosen other disarmament programmes , to volunteer for the new joint national army or to enter a " civil service " programme .
one of the new forces political leaders , sidiki konate , said the ceremony marked the start of the " active phase " of disarmament .
" i think that we have a good programme .
it will take more than four months to finish the disarmament .
i think the disarmament will be effective before the elections in ivory coast . "
those elections are due on 30 november .
in the south , the government forces have already withdrawn to barracks , but the new forces in the north have stayed in the field , saying the welcoming sites were not in a fit state to receive the fighters .
