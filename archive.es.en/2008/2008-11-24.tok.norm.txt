yet many unanswered questions about the incident remain , including whether the men belonged to germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- . max stadler of the free democratic party told the berliner zeitung that he wanted a meeting of the parliamentary committee tasked with overseeing the bnd . " i expect the government and the heads of the bnd to inform the members of parliament , " stadler told the newspaper in an interview published monday , nov .
24 .
" i want to know if the arrestees are bnd employees . " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said monday that the suspects were not registered as intelligence agents . " i have no information on their accreditation .
they could have entered kosovo in a private capacity , " he said , declining to comment further while the investigation is in process . suspects remain jailed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three men have denied the allegations leveled against them , according to media reports lawyers of the men said prosecutors were trying to link their clients to " acts of terrorism , " punishable with up to 20 years in prison . " three german citizens suspected for the explosion ... have to stay one month in detention " the daily express reported sunday according to afp news agency . the kosovar paper added that the germans were " suspected of conducting a criminal act of terrorism . " attorney adem ademi told germany 's dpa news agency in pristina that " some documents " identifying the suspects as bnd agents bnd " were found and presented as evidence , " but he expressed doubts about the documents ' authenticity . asked whether the prosecutor identified the arrested germans as members of the bnd , ademi said : " they are suspected of being members of secret services , but they have n't said explicitly which one . " kosovo and german media reports have claimed the suspects were working for the bnd .
berlin officials have not commented on the allegations . pristina power struggle german terrorism and security expert elmar thevessen told dw-radio that problems within kosovo 's government might be responsible for the detention .
while some within the government support an eu mission that 's due to assume oversight of law-enforcement in kosovo after more than eight years as a united nations protectorate , others reject it . " it looks to me that it is a matter of political intrigue within kosovo , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense at all for the german intelligence service to get involved in a bomb going off in an office of the european union .
as a matter of fact the german government has been known to be one of the biggest supporters of that mission . " thevessen added that bnd agents were also investigating organized crime ties to the kosovo government and that this might be yet another reason why local officials were trying to get rid of them . agents claim innocence police arrested the three germans on wednesday , five days after an explosive device was hurled at the office of the eu 's special representative for the region .
no one was injured in the blast . the three germans said they were inspecting damage done by the bomb blast and were not involved in the attack , according to german media reports . german mass-tabloid bild reported sunday that the bomb attack had been the work of an anti-eu faction of kosovars . anti-eu faction in charge ? the paper said german foreign ministry officials on friday had won an assurance from the kosovo government that there would be no objection to releasing the trio arrested two days earlier . but the faction opposed to european union supervision of the new state won the upper hand on saturday , when the men were committed to custody . kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and pristina , belgrade , the un and eu are currently wrangling over the conditions for the deployment of the eu mission , eulex , comprising 2,000 police , judicial and customs officials . more than 50 states , including the united states and most eu members , have since recognized kosovo . dw staff -lrb- sms / win / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" moscow and tblisi exchanged accusations over an alleged shooting incident sunday , nov .
243 , near the breakaway province of south ossetia .
saakashvili accused russian troops of opening fire on a convoy he was riding in with kaczynski , forcing them to turn back .
" we heard machine-gun volleys about 30 meters -lrb- 100 feet -rrb- from where i was , " the polish pap news agency quoted kaczynski as saying .
automatic gunfire could be heard in shaky television footage but it was unclear where it was coming from .
georgia and russia trade blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president kaczynski backed georgia 's claim of shots fired georgia and russia , which fought a five-day war in august , accused each other of provocation over the incident .
" frankly i did n't expect the russians to open fire .
i thought they clearly saw that this was an official cortege , this was a high delegation , " georgian president mikheil saakashvili said , speaking in english in comments broadcast on bbc world service radio .
russian forces , he said , " were not happy to see us and reacted in this barbaric way . "
" clearly it was intended as a provocation , certainly i would never intend to put the life of the president of poland in danger , that was not my intention but the reality is that you know you are dealing with unpredictable people , " he added .
" aggression continues in georgia , " he said .
" the ceasefire and the european union-brokered agreement are being violated . "
kaczynski was less direct with his words at a news conference : " i appeal from this spot to my friends in the european union to draw the proper conclusions from this event before it is too late ...
i do not regret that trip along that dark road . "
russia : " this is a clear provocation " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , who was accompanying president dmitry medvedev on a trip to the peruvian capital lima for the asia-pacific summit , denied the allegation and accused georgia of deliberate provocation .
" this is a clear provocation , " he told reporters in the peruvian capital lima .
" it is not the first time they are doing so .
they are organizing the provocation and then blame the russian side . "
" when the president invites people to some kind of celebration in tbilisi and then takes a car and takes him to another state , is it not a provocation ?
of course it was , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the checkpoint soldiers were south ossetian , not russian , said one security chief " there was no kind of firing from our positions or south ossetian positions , " he added .
a south ossetian security chief , boris attojev , backed up that claim , telling russian newswire itar-tass that his soldiers stopped the polish-georgian convoy and explained that the border was closed , after which the motorcade left peacefully .
earlier sunday , russian deputy foreign minister grigory karasin had dismissed the claim as " one more instance of wishful thinking on the part of georgia . "
tensions remain high in south ossetia and in another breakaway region , abkhazia , following the august conflict .
russian forces had pushed into georgia - whose candidacy for nato membership is up for review in december - on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the pro-moscow breakaway region of south ossetia .

a full 35 percent would support rules allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients end their lives . the anonymous survey of 483 doctors was conducted for the german news magazine der spiegel .
a full 40 percent of doctors indicated they could imagine helping a patient end his or her life , the survey found .
and 16 percent of doctors said they could envision themselves taking the lead role in helping a patient commit suicide .
assisted suicide became a hot topic in germany earlier this year after roger kusch , an ex-senator in hamburg , advised an elderly woman on how to prepare a deadly cocktail of drugs .
in the wake of the woman 's suicide , politicians have called for laws that would make it illegal for anyone to help someone kill themselves or give them advice on how to do so .

assisted suicide also has also been stigmatized due to the nazi eugenics programs which killed more than 70,000 mentally ill and handicapped people .

nearly one in three said they would want " active " help from a doctor .
germany 's hospice organization said that the results show the need for more ethical training for the medical profession and more money for terminal care .
for the german hospice association , the survey shows " what a bad handle doctors have on ethical and medical questions . "
only four percent of terminally ill patients had access to professional end-of-life care in the last 12 months before their deaths , said eugen brysch , who heads the hospice association .
he said that many doctors can not differentiate between " allowing someone to die " and " killing " someone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 24.11.2008 " aids cure " works in only one percent of patients , doctors say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors this month uncovered the " door handle " that lets in hiv doctors in germany who say they have " functionally cured " a patient with hiv / aids are warning that their accidental breakthrough is effective for only about one percent of patients who suffer from aids . headlines in november heralded an " aids cure " after gero huetter and eckhard thiel , blood-cancer specialists at charite hospital in berlin , reported that they had seemingly cured a 42-year-old us patient of hiv / aids by giving him a bone marrow transplant while treating him for cancer .
their breakthrough was made possible by studies in the late 1990s revealing that some people were resistant to hiv / aids , according to a report in new scientist magazine on the berlin hematologists ' discovery .
in these people , the virus can not enter and destroy the white blood cells that it infects and destroys in most other people .
they owed their resistance to a mutation in the gene which makes the molecular " door handle " by which hiv / aids gains access to cells .
called ccr5 , the protein door handle was misshapen in the immune individuals , locking hiv / aids out of their white blood cells , the new scientist report noted .
mutation in about one percent of europeans since the discovery , it has been established that about one percent of europeans have the same mutation , making them resistant to hiv / aids .
to be resistant , they had to inherit the same mutation from both parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckhard thiel and gero huetter announced their discovery earlier this month huetter and thiel made use of this when treating their patient for leukemia , which he had developed in addition to hiv / aids .
to treat the leukemia , the two doctors did the usual thing and sought a bone marrow donor to replenish the patient 's blood supply following chemotherapy to kill the existing , cancerous blood cells .
but the berlin doctors ' new approach was to get a donor who had the double hiv-resistant ccr5 mutation .
this meant that the patient 's replenished blood system would effectively be resistant to hiv / aids , locking out the virus for good .
this is what appears to have happened , according to the new scientist analysis , and huetter declared his patient " functionally cured . "
building on previous attempts several attempts to use bone marrow transplants in hiv / aids treatment have been made since the 1980s .
in one case , a patient with both hiv / aids and lymphoma died of the cancer two months later , but was found to harbor no hiv / aids .
it was not known if something in the transplant had protected him .
and in a famous 1995 case , jeff getty , a prominent san francisco advocate for hiv / aids patients , received bone marrow from a baboon , which is resistant to the human virus .
the new york times reported that he survived for 11 years , but died of hiv / aids and cancer .
the times said the transplant had not protected him but anti-retroviral triple therapy had been invented in time to help .
hotter and thiel have been quick to say that it is far too early to speak of a widespread general cure for hiv / aids .
they stress that their breakthrough is a sound proof of principle , demonstrating that there is hope for treatments that literally lock hiv / aids out in the cold .
but they warn that an all-out cure for the millions of hiv / aids patients worldwide is still a long way off . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 24.11.2008 " aids cure " works in only one percent of patients , doctors say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors this month uncovered the " door handle " that lets in hiv doctors in germany who say they have " functionally cured " a patient with hiv / aids are warning that their accidental breakthrough is effective for only about one percent of patients who suffer from aids . headlines in november heralded an " aids cure " after gero huetter and eckhard thiel , blood-cancer specialists at charite hospital in berlin , reported that they had seemingly cured a 42-year-old us patient of hiv / aids by giving him a bone marrow transplant while treating him for cancer .
their breakthrough was made possible by studies in the late 1990s revealing that some people were resistant to hiv / aids , according to a report in new scientist magazine on the berlin hematologists ' discovery .
in these people , the virus can not enter and destroy the white blood cells that it infects and destroys in most other people .
they owed their resistance to a mutation in the gene which makes the molecular " door handle " by which hiv / aids gains access to cells .
called ccr5 , the protein door handle was misshapen in the immune individuals , locking hiv / aids out of their white blood cells , the new scientist report noted .
mutation in about one percent of europeans since the discovery , it has been established that about one percent of europeans have the same mutation , making them resistant to hiv / aids .
to be resistant , they had to inherit the same mutation from both parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckhard thiel and gero huetter announced their discovery earlier this month huetter and thiel made use of this when treating their patient for leukemia , which he had developed in addition to hiv / aids .
to treat the leukemia , the two doctors did the usual thing and sought a bone marrow donor to replenish the patient 's blood supply following chemotherapy to kill the existing , cancerous blood cells .
but the berlin doctors ' new approach was to get a donor who had the double hiv-resistant ccr5 mutation .
this meant that the patient 's replenished blood system would effectively be resistant to hiv / aids , locking out the virus for good .
this is what appears to have happened , according to the new scientist analysis , and huetter declared his patient " functionally cured . "
building on previous attempts several attempts to use bone marrow transplants in hiv / aids treatment have been made since the 1980s .
in one case , a patient with both hiv / aids and lymphoma died of the cancer two months later , but was found to harbor no hiv / aids .
it was not known if something in the transplant had protected him .
and in a famous 1995 case , jeff getty , a prominent san francisco advocate for hiv / aids patients , received bone marrow from a baboon , which is resistant to the human virus .
the new york times reported that he survived for 11 years , but died of hiv / aids and cancer .
the times said the transplant had not protected him but anti-retroviral triple therapy had been invented in time to help .
hotter and thiel have been quick to say that it is far too early to speak of a widespread general cure for hiv / aids .
they stress that their breakthrough is a sound proof of principle , demonstrating that there is hope for treatments that literally lock hiv / aids out in the cold .
but they warn that an all-out cure for the millions of hiv / aids patients worldwide is still a long way off . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland 's leader lech kaczynski later pointed the finger at russia . at a joint press conference , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and eu foreign policy head javier solana stopped short of pointing the finger of blame at russia , despite moscow and tbilisi trading accusations over the shooting , seemingly aimed at either georgian president mikheil saakashvili or polish president lech kaczynski .
" i do n't know exactly what happened , " de hoop scheffer said .
" it is wrong and certainly not in the spirit of the -lrb- ceasefire -rrb- agreement , " which ended the brief war between georgia and russian in august , he added .
" we are not blaming anyone , but i blame certainly those who started the shooting . "
georgia , however , has blamed russian troops stationed near south ossetia of opening fire as the presidential convoy drove past , a charge russia has denied .
georgia was celebrating the fifth anniversary of its pro-western rose revolution .
" we are in contact with the -lrb- eu -rrb- monitors , " in georgia and " we will see later today " what the observer mission reports on the incident , the eu 's solana said .
polish president points the finger at russia kaczynski on monday blamed russia for firing on the convoy , despite moscow 's denials .
" there is reason to believe that the russians did the shooting , " kaczynski told reporters after returning from his visit to georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski made it clear who he thinks is responsible " i knew in advance that there was a russian post there , one which should n't have been there " under the terms of august 's ceasefire between moscow and tbilisi , kaczynski said .
" i wanted to check on site , and three or four kalashnikov volleys were fired off - though i 'm not saying they were fired in my direction , " he said .
" the russians , of course , are talking about a set-up by the georgians , " he added .
moscow and tbilisi have traded accusations over the incident near the convoy carrying saakashvili and his staunch ally kaczynski sunday , as georgia marked the fifth anniversary of its pro-western " rose revolution . "
georgia accused russian troops near the breakaway region of south ossetia of opening fire as the convoy carrying the two leaders drove by - a claim russia denied .
in warsaw monday , foreign ministers from the visegrad group of states including the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia as well as the three eu baltic states , bulgaria , romania and sweden condemned the incident and called for an investigation .
" the ministers express deepest concern and strongly condemn the incident in georgia on 23 november 2008 when machine-gun fire was opened in immediate vicinity of a motorcade carrying the presidents of georgia and poland , close to south ossetia , georgia , " the minister said in a joint statement .
" the ministers call for proper investigation and clarification of the incident , " it said .
nato chief dispels rumors of naval blockade in somalia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has no plans to set up a naval blockade de hoop scheffer also used the press conference to dispel notions nato was considering a naval blockade to counter pirates in waters off somalia .
" blocking ports is not contemplated by nato , " he told reporters .
he said a blockade did not have the backing of the un security council .
" this is , at the moment , not on the cards . "
an eu mission , dubbed atalanta , is to assume patrol duties off somalia in mid-december from a four-vessel nato fleet that has been protecting food aid shipments to the horn of africa .
military top brass warns of afghanistan failure also monday , nato 's top military commander , general bantz j. craddock , said a stabilization of afghanistan would not happen unless the alliance boosted its troop presence by 40 percent - around 20,000 more soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato forces in afghanistan need a boost , says craddock the united states is set to deploy an extra brigade of up to 5,000 men to afghanistan in 2009 , and " we are looking at how to resource a request from -lrb- nato -rrb- command in afghanistan -rrb- for three more brigades , " craddock said at nato headquarters in belgium .
nato currently has just over 50,000 men in afghanistan under the un-mandated international security assistance force , but they are facing an increasingly bloody challenge from the taliban , especially in the restive east and south of the country .
" where the security is problematic today is about the same places as it was a year ago ... but it is more virulent and it is at a higher tempo than it was last year , " craddock said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , media reports speculate that a real madrid representative was due in munich this week to talk to 24-year-old midfielder schweinsteiger , who can leave on a free transfer in summer and has also been linked with a handful of italian clubs .
podolski and schweinsteiger were the toast of the germany team at the 2006 world cup .
despite their age they have already won 60 and 62 national team caps , respectively .
poldi 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has spent more time on bayern 's bench than on the park but while schweinsteiger has been a regular starter at bayern under new coach juergen klinsmann , striker podolski has been unable to secure a regular first-team birth .
podolski came to munich from cologne in 2006 for 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.6 million -rrb- but has played just 58 games and scored a meagre 12 goals , far less than the 31 he has netted for germany .
furthermore , he has been made to stand in the shadow of italian international luca toni and fellow germany national team representative miroslav klose .
" i have told those responsible that i want to leave -lrb- the club -rrb- in winter , " podolski was quoted as telling the " bild " daily .
podolski has been frequently linked with a return to his home club cologne , but bayern general manager uli hoeness reiterated on the weekend that no player would leave during the winter break .
schweini draws italian , spanish eyes bayern have started talks with schweinsteiger about a contract renewal beyond 2009 but appear to face more and more interest from rivals clubs abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger has drawn much interest from abroad sports magazine " kicker " reported that real 's technical director miguel angel portugal was scheduled to meet the player and his representatives this week .
meanwhile , italy 's " la gazzetta dello sport " has linked schweinsteiger with a move to juventus .
the report said juve had prepared an offer for a four-year contract and an annual salary of 3.5 million euros should schweinsteiger decide to part ways with munich .
ac milan are reportedly also after the midfielder despite speculation that bayern could be ready to almost double his current salary of an estimated at 3 million euros .

a full 35 percent would support rules allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients end their lives . the anonymous survey of 483 doctors was conducted for the german news magazine der spiegel .
a full 40 percent of doctors indicated they could imagine helping a patient end his or her life , the survey found .
and 16 percent of doctors said they could envision themselves taking the lead role in helping a patient commit suicide .
assisted suicide became a hot topic in germany earlier this year after roger kusch , an ex-senator in hamburg , advised an elderly woman on how to prepare a deadly cocktail of drugs .
in the wake of the woman 's suicide , politicians have called for laws that would make it illegal for anyone to help someone kill themselves or give them advice on how to do so .
violation of medical ethics the doctors taking part in the survey were general practitioners , oncologists , internists , anesthesiologists or palliative medicine practitioners who deal with extremely ill patients in hospitals .

assisted suicide also has also been stigmatized due to the nazi eugenics programs which killed more than 70,000 mentally ill and handicapped people .
hospice organization decries attitude in the survey , 44.5 percent of the doctors said that if they were in the situation of being terminally ill , they would want a colleague to be allowed to help them commit suicide .
nearly one in three said they would want " active " help from a doctor .
germany 's hospice organization said that the results show the need for more ethical training for the medical profession and more money for terminal care .
for the german hospice association , the survey shows " what a bad handle doctors have on ethical and medical questions . "
only four percent of terminally ill patients had access to professional end-of-life care in the last 12 months before their deaths , said eugen brysch , who heads the hospice association .
he said that many doctors can not differentiate between " allowing someone to die " and " killing " someone .

24 against rushing into adopting a europe-wide economic stimulus package and ruled out reducing value-added tax in germany after talks with french president sarkozy . speaking after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , merkel said the seriousness of the current economic downturn called for a timely and measured approach to the situation .
" the risk that we are running today , taking into account information that is not always easy -lrb- to interpret -rrb- , is that we mistake haste for action , " she said .
vat cuts ' not right ' for germany both sarkozy and merkel also said their countries would not undertake a uk-style slashing of value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to stimulate spending as a way of fighting the financial crisis .
" a lower vat is not the right solution for france and germany , " merkel said .
" we are both agreed . "
sarkozy said lowering vat may be a viable option for other countries , such as britain , but agreed that it was a wrong fit for paris and berlin .
" when we lower the vat , what does that bring ?
only lower prices , " sarkozy said .
" we think other measures , such as emphasizing innovation and research , would be more effective for our economies . "
however , in his successful campaign for the 2007 presidential election , sarkozy vowed that he would convince the eu to allow france to lower its vat , particularly for french restaurants , where the tax is 19.6 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vat cuts would just reduce profits for businesses like restaurants but germany has repeatedly vetoed the proposal in brussels , claiming that lowering the vat in france to the proposed 5.5 percent would give french restaurants an unfair competitive advantage over german eateries , where vat is 19 percent .
europe-wide package the talks were part of regular joint-cabinet meetings between the french and german governments .
sarkozy was also to use the discussion as an opportunity to persuade merkel of the merits of a europe-wide economic stimulus package to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany has steadfastly rejected contributing a larger slice of its profits for europe .
the french president said nonetheless there was " much more agreement than disagreement " between the two sides on how to re-launch their economies .
" we acted together on the crisis .
we made the same analysis , " sarkozy said .
heat is on germany germany , as europe 's largest and the world 's third largest economy , has been under pressure in recent weeks to do more to help kick-start the european economy .
merkel 's government has already pledged 1.3 percent of gdp to energize the german economy , but brussels is to request a further 1 percent of gdp to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany 's contribution would translate to around 25 billion euros .
the stimulus package plan is to be unveiled by the european commission on wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .
but berlin has insisted it was already doing enough and need n't contribute further funds to reinvigorate europe 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are one of several focuses of the government stimulus package germany unveiled a 32-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- package for its economy on wednesday , nov .
5 , involving tax cuts , infrastructure projects and cheap corporate loans .
the deal equates to roughly 1.3 percent of german gdp .
the money is to be focussed on the hardest-hit sectors such as automobile manufacturing and construction .
a spokesman for chancellor merkel said that germany would be disadvantaged if it contributed another one percent of gdp on top of the existing 1.3 percent already pledged .
" nations that have already acted in recent weeks should not be punished for it , while those who have done nothing end up better off , " he said thursday , nov .

23 . the croatia striker left goalkeeper tim wiese with no chance when he cut in from the right and hammered a left-foot shot from the corner of the penalty area into the keeper 's top right-hand corner .
wiese had been met by jeers from hamburg fans for a studs-high challenge on olic in last season 's derby at hamburg - and the croatian provided the perfect response .
" i was surprised myself .
that was my best goal yet , but the most important thing was winning the three points , " olic said .
reconciliatory jersey swap olic said there had never been any hard feelings over wiese 's tackle last season , and the two demonstratively swapped shirts inside the stadium at the end of the game .
wiese said he could do nothing about olic 's 74th-minute strike into the angle of post and crossbar .
" i think it could be the goal of the year .
it was a super goal right into the top corner , " he said .
the goal settled a scrappy affair in which neither side was able to create much after paolo guerrero had given hamburg an early lead only for diego to level with a free-kick .
hamburg , who have not been beaten at home since the defeat by bremen late last season , are fifth on 26 points , five behind leaders hoffenheim , while bremen remain ninth on 20 points .
hamburg gained an early advantage when guerrero struck in the sixth minute to rifle the ball in from a narrow angle .
wiese did well to get down low at the near post to keep out a well-struck mladen petric free-kick , but guerrero reacted quickly to rifle the loose ball past wiese .
werder recovered quickly and a naldo free-kick flashed just wide of the post before the visitors were back on level terms in the 24th minute from another set-piece .
bastian reinhardt clipped diego 's heels just outside the area and the brazilian placed the free-kick wide of the wall and keeper frank rost , who got a hand to the ball but was unable to stop the shot .
spectator causes injury bildunterschrift : baumann , right , was injured by a thrown object werder captain frank baumann needed treatment after being struck in the face by an object - believed to be a battery - thrown from the crowd while joining diego and team-mates to celebrate the goal near the corner flag .
" it hit me on just above the left eye-brow .
it was a shock and painful .
there was a little bit of blood but it did n't hinder me , " baumann said .
hamburg sports director dietmar beiersdorfer said : " i want to apologize in the name of sv hamburg .
we do n't know who it was but that sort of thing should n't happen . "
neither side looked capable of fashioning a chance until olic 's goal , which triggered some desperate efforts by bremen to get back in the game .
but it was hamburg who came closest when piotr trochowski was through in stoppage time only for his shot to be saved by wiese .
" i ca n't say the win was deserved but i am very pleased , " hamburg coach martin jol said .
" we started well enough .
the first 10 minutes were good but then werder were the better side even though they did n't have any chances . "

24 against rushing into adopting a europe-wide economic stimulus package and ruled out reducing value-added tax in germany after talks with french president sarkozy . speaking after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , merkel said the seriousness of the current economic downturn called for a timely and measured approach to the situation .
" the risk that we are running today , taking into account information that is not always easy -lrb- to interpret -rrb- , is that we mistake haste for action , " she said .
vat cuts ' not right ' for germany both sarkozy and merkel also said their countries would not undertake a uk-style slashing of value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to stimulate spending as a way of fighting the financial crisis .
" a lower vat is not the right solution for france and germany , " merkel said .
" we are both agreed . "
sarkozy said lowering vat may be a viable option for other countries , such as britain , but agreed that it was a wrong fit for paris and berlin .
" when we lower the vat , what does that bring ?
only lower prices , " sarkozy said .
" we think other measures , such as emphasizing innovation and research , would be more effective for our economies . "
however , in his successful campaign for the 2007 presidential election , sarkozy vowed that he would convince the eu to allow france to lower its vat , particularly for french restaurants , where the tax is 19.6 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vat cuts would just reduce profits for businesses like restaurants but germany has repeatedly vetoed the proposal in brussels , claiming that lowering the vat in france to the proposed 5.5 percent would give french restaurants an unfair competitive advantage over german eateries , where vat is 19 percent .
europe-wide package the talks were part of regular joint-cabinet meetings between the french and german governments .
sarkozy was also to use the discussion as an opportunity to persuade merkel of the merits of a europe-wide economic stimulus package to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany has steadfastly rejected contributing a larger slice of its profits for europe .
the french president said nonetheless there was " much more agreement than disagreement " between the two sides on how to re-launch their economies .
" we acted together on the crisis .
we made the same analysis , " sarkozy said .
heat is on germany germany , as europe 's largest and the world 's third largest economy , has been under pressure in recent weeks to do more to help kick-start the european economy .
merkel 's government has already pledged 1.3 percent of gdp to energize the german economy , but brussels is to request a further 1 percent of gdp to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany 's contribution would translate to around 25 billion euros .

24 against rushing into adopting a europe-wide economic stimulus package and ruled out reducing value-added tax in germany after talks with french president sarkozy . speaking after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , merkel said the seriousness of the current economic downturn called for a timely and measured approach to the situation .
" the risk that we are running today , taking into account information that is not always easy -lrb- to interpret -rrb- , is that we mistake haste for action , " she said .
vat cuts ' not right ' for germany both sarkozy and merkel also said their countries would not undertake a uk-style slashing of value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to stimulate spending as a way of fighting the financial crisis .
" a lower vat is not the right solution for france and germany , " merkel said .
" we are both agreed . "
sarkozy said lowering vat may be a viable option for other countries , such as britain , but agreed that it was a wrong fit for paris and berlin .
" when we lower the vat , what does that bring ?
only lower prices , " sarkozy said .
" we think other measures , such as emphasizing innovation and research , would be more effective for our economies . "
however , in his successful campaign for the 2007 presidential election , sarkozy vowed that he would convince the eu to allow france to lower its vat , particularly for french restaurants , where the tax is 19.6 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vat cuts would just reduce profits for businesses like restaurants but germany has repeatedly vetoed the proposal in brussels , claiming that lowering the vat in france to the proposed 5.5 percent would give french restaurants an unfair competitive advantage over german eateries , where vat is 19 percent .
europe-wide package the talks were part of regular joint-cabinet meetings between the french and german governments .
sarkozy was also to use the discussion as an opportunity to persuade merkel of the merits of a europe-wide economic stimulus package to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany has steadfastly rejected contributing a larger slice of its profits for europe .
the french president said nonetheless there was " much more agreement than disagreement " between the two sides on how to re-launch their economies .
" we acted together on the crisis .
we made the same analysis , " sarkozy said .
heat is on germany germany , as europe 's largest and the world 's third largest economy , has been under pressure in recent weeks to do more to help kick-start the european economy .
merkel 's government has already pledged 1.3 percent of gdp to energize the german economy , but brussels is to request a further 1 percent of gdp to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany 's contribution would translate to around 25 billion euros .
the stimulus package plan is to be unveiled by the european commission on wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .
but berlin has insisted it was already doing enough and need n't contribute further funds to reinvigorate europe 's economy .

germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , officially entered a recession in the third quarter of this year .
automakers , chemical manufacturers and steelmakers have already announced sharp drops in production and staff cutbacks .
but an additional 230,000 people are expected to be laid off during what economist predict will be a tough 2009 .
" on the whole , the economic downturn has worsened and will now have an impact on the labor market , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said .
" export business is expected to weaken at an accelerated pace and plans call for reductions in staff . "
bad news " spreading like wildfire " germany 's bild newspaper reported that a full 52 percent of businesses in eastern germany and 45 percent of businesses in western germany expect to lay off workers in 2009 .

23 . the croatia striker left goalkeeper tim wiese with no chance when he cut in from the right and hammered a left-foot shot from the corner of the penalty area into the keeper 's top right-hand corner .
wiese had been met by jeers from hamburg fans for a studs-high challenge on olic in last season 's derby at hamburg - and the croatian provided the perfect response .
" i was surprised myself .
that was my best goal yet , but the most important thing was winning the three points , " olic said .
reconciliatory jersey swap olic said there had never been any hard feelings over wiese 's tackle last season , and the two demonstratively swapped shirts inside the stadium at the end of the game .
wiese said he could do nothing about olic 's 74th-minute strike into the angle of post and crossbar .
" i think it could be the goal of the year .
it was a super goal right into the top corner , " he said .
the goal settled a scrappy affair in which neither side was able to create much after paolo guerrero had given hamburg an early lead only for diego to level with a free-kick .
hamburg , who have not been beaten at home since the defeat by bremen late last season , are fifth on 26 points , five behind leaders hoffenheim , while bremen remain ninth on 20 points .
hamburg gained an early advantage when guerrero struck in the sixth minute to rifle the ball in from a narrow angle .
wiese did well to get down low at the near post to keep out a well-struck mladen petric free-kick , but guerrero reacted quickly to rifle the loose ball past wiese .
werder recovered quickly and a naldo free-kick flashed just wide of the post before the visitors were back on level terms in the 24th minute from another set-piece .
bastian reinhardt clipped diego 's heels just outside the area and the brazilian placed the free-kick wide of the wall and keeper frank rost , who got a hand to the ball but was unable to stop the shot .
spectator causes injury bildunterschrift : baumann , right , was injured by a thrown object werder captain frank baumann needed treatment after being struck in the face by an object - believed to be a battery - thrown from the crowd while joining diego and team-mates to celebrate the goal near the corner flag .
" it hit me on just above the left eye-brow .
it was a shock and painful .
there was a little bit of blood but it did n't hinder me , " baumann said .
hamburg sports director dietmar beiersdorfer said : " i want to apologize in the name of sv hamburg .
we do n't know who it was but that sort of thing should n't happen . "
neither side looked capable of fashioning a chance until olic 's goal , which triggered some desperate efforts by bremen to get back in the game .
but it was hamburg who came closest when piotr trochowski was through in stoppage time only for his shot to be saved by wiese .
" i ca n't say the win was deserved but i am very pleased , " hamburg coach martin jol said .
" we started well enough .
the first 10 minutes were good but then werder were the better side even though they did n't have any chances . "

24 against rushing into adopting a europe-wide economic stimulus package and ruled out reducing value-added tax in germany after talks with french president sarkozy . speaking after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , merkel said the seriousness of the current economic downturn called for a timely and measured approach to the situation .
" the risk that we are running today , taking into account information that is not always easy -lrb- to interpret -rrb- , is that we mistake haste for action , " she said .
vat cuts ' not right ' for germany both sarkozy and merkel also said their countries would not undertake a uk-style slashing of value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to stimulate spending as a way of fighting the financial crisis .
" a lower vat is not the right solution for france and germany , " merkel said .
" we are both agreed . "
sarkozy said lowering vat may be a viable option for other countries , such as britain , but agreed that it was a wrong fit for paris and berlin .
" when we lower the vat , what does that bring ?
only lower prices , " sarkozy said .
" we think other measures , such as emphasizing innovation and research , would be more effective for our economies . "
however , in his successful campaign for the 2007 presidential election , sarkozy vowed that he would convince the eu to allow france to lower its vat , particularly for french restaurants , where the tax is 19.6 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vat cuts would just reduce profits for businesses like restaurants but germany has repeatedly vetoed the proposal in brussels , claiming that lowering the vat in france to the proposed 5.5 percent would give french restaurants an unfair competitive advantage over german eateries , where vat is 19 percent .
europe-wide package the talks were part of regular joint-cabinet meetings between the french and german governments .
sarkozy was also to use the discussion as an opportunity to persuade merkel of the merits of a europe-wide economic stimulus package to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany has steadfastly rejected contributing a larger slice of its profits for europe .
the french president said nonetheless there was " much more agreement than disagreement " between the two sides on how to re-launch their economies .
" we acted together on the crisis .
we made the same analysis , " sarkozy said .
heat is on germany germany , as europe 's largest and the world 's third largest economy , has been under pressure in recent weeks to do more to help kick-start the european economy .
merkel 's government has already pledged 1.3 percent of gdp to energize the german economy , but brussels is to request a further 1 percent of gdp to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany 's contribution would translate to around 25 billion euros .
the stimulus package plan is to be unveiled by the european commission on wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .
but berlin has insisted it was already doing enough and need n't contribute further funds to reinvigorate europe 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are one of several focuses of the government stimulus package germany unveiled a 32-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- package for its economy on wednesday , nov .
5 , involving tax cuts , infrastructure projects and cheap corporate loans .
the deal equates to roughly 1.3 percent of german gdp .
the money is to be focussed on the hardest-hit sectors such as automobile manufacturing and construction .
a spokesman for chancellor merkel said that germany would be disadvantaged if it contributed another one percent of gdp on top of the existing 1.3 percent already pledged .
" nations that have already acted in recent weeks should not be punished for it , while those who have done nothing end up better off , " he said thursday , nov .

nato currently has just over 50,000 men in afghanistan under the un-mandated international security assistance force , but they are facing an increasingly bloody challenge from the taliban , especially in the restive east and south of the country .

for helping to better the world for others like her , mam received the roland berger human dignity award monday . “ myself acquainted with misfortune , i learn to help the unfortunate ” - so said the poet virgil over 2000 years ago .
the saying , however , is one that could have come from the mouth of somaly mam , a cambodian woman who lived through slavery and prostitution as a child and faced every conceivable form of violence .
having escaped that misfortune , mam now uses her horrendous life experience to help fight for the rights of other young women who have been in her situation .
twelve years ago , she founded an ngo for women and children who were used as sex slaves called afesip , or acting for women in distressing situations .
on monday , november 24 , german president horst koehler recognized mam 's work by presenting her with the roland berger human dignity award .
the award , intended for those who work in the field of human rights and financed by the roland berger foundation , is endowed with a million euros .
this is the first year the prize has been awarded .
childhood over at ten born around 38 years ago to parents she would never know , mam was raised by foster parents in the eastern cambodian province of mondolkiri .
at the age of 10 , she moved in with an older man whom she referred to as “ grandpa ” and began her work as a domestic slave to the attentive man .
her childhood ended then ; running the home became her most important duty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mam says cambodian women and children have no say in their lives four or five years later , mam was handed over by “ grandpa ” to a man twelve years her senior , forced to marry to settle an outstanding debt .
that her grandfather had made such a decision about her life , her body and her destiny is something she did n't question .
“ in cambodia , women do n't have the right to say no , ” she said .
“ women and children must sacrifice their entire life to the family . ”
her husband disappeared shortly after their marriage and “ grandpa ” then brought her to a bordello in the cambodian capitol of phnom penh .
“ i thought i owed him something .
he fed me so i thought i had to be thankful and do everything for him . ”
trust fell by the wayside the years following saw mam held as a sex slave .
in those years , violence , malnutrition , abuse and drugs intertwined .
attempts at escape were always hindered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodia 's red light district attracts sex toursists from around the world “ my pimp would catch me and barricade me in a cage with snakes , ” mam recalls .
the memory floods the beautiful woman 's brown eyes with tears when she relates it even today . still , she speaks and writes about her experiences often .
her memoir , “ the road of lost innocence ” was published two years ago .
" i can smile and speak today , but deep in my heart , i do n't feel as normal as you , ” she told guests at the book 's launch party .
“ i do n't know how to love another person .
i do n't know how to trust anyone . ”
mam has , however , learned to trust at least one man : pierre legros , a frenchman she met in cambodia who helped her to flee from the brothel .
she went with him to france , married him and later returned with him to cambodia , where she founded afesip .
the organization and its workers , with support from unicef , have thus far freed a thousand women and children from forced prostitution .
afesip helps them to win back their self-confidence , to re-enter the community , to read and write and later , to train for future careers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literacy is one area afesip focuses on every time mam helps a young girl , she is faced once again with her own fortune and sees the pain and suffering in them reflecting back at her like a mirror .
it 's an immense burden but also an advantage , mam believes .
“ if i had n't had the experiences that i 'd had , i could n't have been able to help these young girls so well . ”
threats an everyday experience the necessity of mam 's work is clearly shown when one looks at the horrific statistics concerning sex slavery in cambodia .
a un report estimates that 50,000 women and young girls are victims of sexual violence every day .
ninety percent of children freed from brothels have tested positive for hiv .
the country ranks as a top destination for sex tourists , which supports a continuation of forced slavery and human trafficking .
still , not everyone agrees with mam 's work .
she 's publicly attacked politicians and businessmen in her homeland for their involvement in corruption and prostitution .
threats of murder and verbal attacks at the “ whistleblower ” are an everyday part of life for mam , as are muggings and kidnappings .
but she wo n't let that stop her .
“ every day , when i see these victims , these women who have been abused , who have so much pain , i know i simply ca n't turn my back on them .
i have to fight with all my power .
i will never give up .

for helping to better the world for others like her , mam received the roland berger human dignity award monday . “ myself acquainted with misfortune , i learn to help the unfortunate ” - so said the poet virgil over 2000 years ago .
the saying , however , is one that could have come from the mouth of somaly mam , a cambodian woman who lived through slavery and prostitution as a child and faced every conceivable form of violence .
having escaped that misfortune , mam now uses her horrendous life experience to help fight for the rights of other young women who have been in her situation .
twelve years ago , she founded an ngo for women and children who were used as sex slaves called afesip , or acting for women in distressing situations .
on monday , november 24 , german president horst koehler recognized mam 's work by presenting her with the roland berger human dignity award .
the award , intended for those who work in the field of human rights and financed by the roland berger foundation , is endowed with a million euros .
this is the first year the prize has been awarded .
childhood over at ten born around 38 years ago to parents she would never know , mam was raised by foster parents in the eastern cambodian province of mondolkiri .
at the age of 10 , she moved in with an older man whom she referred to as “ grandpa ” and began her work as a domestic slave to the attentive man .
her childhood ended then ; running the home became her most important duty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mam says cambodian women and children have no say in their lives four or five years later , mam was handed over by “ grandpa ” to a man twelve years her senior , forced to marry to settle an outstanding debt .
that her grandfather had made such a decision about her life , her body and her destiny is something she did n't question .
“ in cambodia , women do n't have the right to say no , ” she said .
“ women and children must sacrifice their entire life to the family . ”
her husband disappeared shortly after their marriage and “ grandpa ” then brought her to a bordello in the cambodian capitol of phnom penh .
“ i thought i owed him something .
he fed me so i thought i had to be thankful and do everything for him . ”
trust fell by the wayside the years following saw mam held as a sex slave .
in those years , violence , malnutrition , abuse and drugs intertwined .
attempts at escape were always hindered .

their breakthrough was made possible by studies in the late 1990s revealing that some people were resistant to hiv / aids , according to a report in new scientist magazine on the berlin hematologists ' discovery .
in these people , the virus can not enter and destroy the white blood cells that it infects and destroys in most other people .
they owed their resistance to a mutation in the gene which makes the molecular " door handle " by which hiv / aids gains access to cells .
called ccr5 , the protein door handle was misshapen in the immune individuals , locking hiv / aids out of their white blood cells , the new scientist report noted .

to treat the leukemia , the two doctors did the usual thing and sought a bone marrow donor to replenish the patient 's blood supply following chemotherapy to kill the existing , cancerous blood cells .
but the berlin doctors ' new approach was to get a donor who had the double hiv-resistant ccr5 mutation .
this meant that the patient 's replenished blood system would effectively be resistant to hiv / aids , locking out the virus for good .
this is what appears to have happened , according to the new scientist analysis , and huetter declared his patient " functionally cured . "
building on previous attempts several attempts to use bone marrow transplants in hiv / aids treatment have been made since the 1980s .
in one case , a patient with both hiv / aids and lymphoma died of the cancer two months later , but was found to harbor no hiv / aids .
it was not known if something in the transplant had protected him .
and in a famous 1995 case , jeff getty , a prominent san francisco advocate for hiv / aids patients , received bone marrow from a baboon , which is resistant to the human virus .
the new york times reported that he survived for 11 years , but died of hiv / aids and cancer .
the times said the transplant had not protected him but anti-retroviral triple therapy had been invented in time to help .
hotter and thiel have been quick to say that it is far too early to speak of a widespread general cure for hiv / aids .
they stress that their breakthrough is a sound proof of principle , demonstrating that there is hope for treatments that literally lock hiv / aids out in the cold .

their breakthrough was made possible by studies in the late 1990s revealing that some people were resistant to hiv / aids , according to a report in new scientist magazine on the berlin hematologists ' discovery .
in these people , the virus can not enter and destroy the white blood cells that it infects and destroys in most other people .
they owed their resistance to a mutation in the gene which makes the molecular " door handle " by which hiv / aids gains access to cells .
called ccr5 , the protein door handle was misshapen in the immune individuals , locking hiv / aids out of their white blood cells , the new scientist report noted .
mutation in about one percent of europeans since the discovery , it has been established that about one percent of europeans have the same mutation , making them resistant to hiv / aids .
to be resistant , they had to inherit the same mutation from both parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckhard thiel and gero huetter announced their discovery earlier this month huetter and thiel made use of this when treating their patient for leukemia , which he had developed in addition to hiv / aids .
to treat the leukemia , the two doctors did the usual thing and sought a bone marrow donor to replenish the patient 's blood supply following chemotherapy to kill the existing , cancerous blood cells .
but the berlin doctors ' new approach was to get a donor who had the double hiv-resistant ccr5 mutation .
this meant that the patient 's replenished blood system would effectively be resistant to hiv / aids , locking out the virus for good .
this is what appears to have happened , according to the new scientist analysis , and huetter declared his patient " functionally cured . "
building on previous attempts several attempts to use bone marrow transplants in hiv / aids treatment have been made since the 1980s .
in one case , a patient with both hiv / aids and lymphoma died of the cancer two months later , but was found to harbor no hiv / aids .
it was not known if something in the transplant had protected him .
and in a famous 1995 case , jeff getty , a prominent san francisco advocate for hiv / aids patients , received bone marrow from a baboon , which is resistant to the human virus .
the new york times reported that he survived for 11 years , but died of hiv / aids and cancer .
the times said the transplant had not protected him but anti-retroviral triple therapy had been invented in time to help .
hotter and thiel have been quick to say that it is far too early to speak of a widespread general cure for hiv / aids .
they stress that their breakthrough is a sound proof of principle , demonstrating that there is hope for treatments that literally lock hiv / aids out in the cold .
but they warn that an all-out cure for the millions of hiv / aids patients worldwide is still a long way off . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for helping to better the world for others like her , mam received the roland berger human dignity award monday . “ myself acquainted with misfortune , i learn to help the unfortunate ” - so said the poet virgil over 2000 years ago .
the saying , however , is one that could have come from the mouth of somaly mam , a cambodian woman who lived through slavery and prostitution as a child and faced every conceivable form of violence .
having escaped that misfortune , mam now uses her horrendous life experience to help fight for the rights of other young women who have been in her situation .
twelve years ago , she founded an ngo for women and children who were used as sex slaves called afesip , or acting for women in distressing situations .
on monday , november 24 , german president horst koehler recognized mam 's work by presenting her with the roland berger human dignity award .
the award , intended for those who work in the field of human rights and financed by the roland berger foundation , is endowed with a million euros .
this is the first year the prize has been awarded .
childhood over at ten born around 38 years ago to parents she would never know , mam was raised by foster parents in the eastern cambodian province of mondolkiri .
at the age of 10 , she moved in with an older man whom she referred to as “ grandpa ” and began her work as a domestic slave to the attentive man .
her childhood ended then ; running the home became her most important duty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mam says cambodian women and children have no say in their lives four or five years later , mam was handed over by “ grandpa ” to a man twelve years her senior , forced to marry to settle an outstanding debt .
that her grandfather had made such a decision about her life , her body and her destiny is something she did n't question .
“ in cambodia , women do n't have the right to say no , ” she said .
“ women and children must sacrifice their entire life to the family . ”
her husband disappeared shortly after their marriage and “ grandpa ” then brought her to a bordello in the cambodian capitol of phnom penh .
“ i thought i owed him something .
he fed me so i thought i had to be thankful and do everything for him . ”
trust fell by the wayside the years following saw mam held as a sex slave .
in those years , violence , malnutrition , abuse and drugs intertwined .
attempts at escape were always hindered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodia 's red light district attracts sex toursists from around the world “ my pimp would catch me and barricade me in a cage with snakes , ” mam recalls .
the memory floods the beautiful woman 's brown eyes with tears when she relates it even today . still , she speaks and writes about her experiences often .
her memoir , “ the road of lost innocence ” was published two years ago .
" i can smile and speak today , but deep in my heart , i do n't feel as normal as you , ” she told guests at the book 's launch party .
“ i do n't know how to love another person .
i do n't know how to trust anyone . ”
mam has , however , learned to trust at least one man : pierre legros , a frenchman she met in cambodia who helped her to flee from the brothel .
she went with him to france , married him and later returned with him to cambodia , where she founded afesip .
the organization and its workers , with support from unicef , have thus far freed a thousand women and children from forced prostitution .
afesip helps them to win back their self-confidence , to re-enter the community , to read and write and later , to train for future careers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literacy is one area afesip focuses on every time mam helps a young girl , she is faced once again with her own fortune and sees the pain and suffering in them reflecting back at her like a mirror .
it 's an immense burden but also an advantage , mam believes .
“ if i had n't had the experiences that i 'd had , i could n't have been able to help these young girls so well . ”
threats an everyday experience the necessity of mam 's work is clearly shown when one looks at the horrific statistics concerning sex slavery in cambodia .
a un report estimates that 50,000 women and young girls are victims of sexual violence every day .
ninety percent of children freed from brothels have tested positive for hiv .
the country ranks as a top destination for sex tourists , which supports a continuation of forced slavery and human trafficking .
still , not everyone agrees with mam 's work .
she 's publicly attacked politicians and businessmen in her homeland for their involvement in corruption and prostitution .
threats of murder and verbal attacks at the “ whistleblower ” are an everyday part of life for mam , as are muggings and kidnappings .
but she wo n't let that stop her .
“ every day , when i see these victims , these women who have been abused , who have so much pain , i know i simply ca n't turn my back on them .
i have to fight with all my power .
i will never give up .
never . ” anja koch -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

putin added on monday that russia was hoping for " more constructive " negotiations on a key nuclear arms treaty set to expire next year .
the comments came as medvedev eased his tone , saying at an asia- pacific forum in peru that he was open to compromise with the new us administration .
medvedev holds out for obama u-turn " dialogue is possible , a change of position is possible , " medvedev was quoted by news agency interfax as saying in lima , where current us president george w bush was also in attendance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 24.11.2008 olic belter gives hamburg edge over rivals bremen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic , left , helped lead hamburg to victory ivica olic hit an unstoppable shot from outside the area to give sv hamburg a hard-fought 2-1 victory over werder bremen in the northern german derby on sunday , nov .
23 . the croatia striker left goalkeeper tim wiese with no chance when he cut in from the right and hammered a left-foot shot from the corner of the penalty area into the keeper 's top right-hand corner .
wiese had been met by jeers from hamburg fans for a studs-high challenge on olic in last season 's derby at hamburg - and the croatian provided the perfect response .
" i was surprised myself .
that was my best goal yet , but the most important thing was winning the three points , " olic said .
reconciliatory jersey swap olic said there had never been any hard feelings over wiese 's tackle last season , and the two demonstratively swapped shirts inside the stadium at the end of the game .
wiese said he could do nothing about olic 's 74th-minute strike into the angle of post and crossbar .
" i think it could be the goal of the year .
it was a super goal right into the top corner , " he said .
the goal settled a scrappy affair in which neither side was able to create much after paolo guerrero had given hamburg an early lead only for diego to level with a free-kick .
hamburg , who have not been beaten at home since the defeat by bremen late last season , are fifth on 26 points , five behind leaders hoffenheim , while bremen remain ninth on 20 points .
hamburg gained an early advantage when guerrero struck in the sixth minute to rifle the ball in from a narrow angle .
wiese did well to get down low at the near post to keep out a well-struck mladen petric free-kick , but guerrero reacted quickly to rifle the loose ball past wiese .
werder recovered quickly and a naldo free-kick flashed just wide of the post before the visitors were back on level terms in the 24th minute from another set-piece .
bastian reinhardt clipped diego 's heels just outside the area and the brazilian placed the free-kick wide of the wall and keeper frank rost , who got a hand to the ball but was unable to stop the shot .
spectator causes injury bildunterschrift : baumann , right , was injured by a thrown object werder captain frank baumann needed treatment after being struck in the face by an object - believed to be a battery - thrown from the crowd while joining diego and team-mates to celebrate the goal near the corner flag .
" it hit me on just above the left eye-brow .
it was a shock and painful .
there was a little bit of blood but it did n't hinder me , " baumann said .
hamburg sports director dietmar beiersdorfer said : " i want to apologize in the name of sv hamburg .
we do n't know who it was but that sort of thing should n't happen . "
neither side looked capable of fashioning a chance until olic 's goal , which triggered some desperate efforts by bremen to get back in the game .
but it was hamburg who came closest when piotr trochowski was through in stoppage time only for his shot to be saved by wiese .
" i ca n't say the win was deserved but i am very pleased , " hamburg coach martin jol said .
" we started well enough .
the first 10 minutes were good but then werder were the better side even though they did n't have any chances . "
bremen coach thomas schaaf said : " we did n't get as much out of the game as we put into it .
we played well but could n't turn our superiority in midfield into goals . "

23 . the croatia striker left goalkeeper tim wiese with no chance when he cut in from the right and hammered a left-foot shot from the corner of the penalty area into the keeper 's top right-hand corner .
wiese had been met by jeers from hamburg fans for a studs-high challenge on olic in last season 's derby at hamburg - and the croatian provided the perfect response .
" i was surprised myself .
that was my best goal yet , but the most important thing was winning the three points , " olic said .
reconciliatory jersey swap olic said there had never been any hard feelings over wiese 's tackle last season , and the two demonstratively swapped shirts inside the stadium at the end of the game .
wiese said he could do nothing about olic 's 74th-minute strike into the angle of post and crossbar .
" i think it could be the goal of the year .
it was a super goal right into the top corner , " he said .
the goal settled a scrappy affair in which neither side was able to create much after paolo guerrero had given hamburg an early lead only for diego to level with a free-kick .
hamburg , who have not been beaten at home since the defeat by bremen late last season , are fifth on 26 points , five behind leaders hoffenheim , while bremen remain ninth on 20 points .
hamburg gained an early advantage when guerrero struck in the sixth minute to rifle the ball in from a narrow angle .
wiese did well to get down low at the near post to keep out a well-struck mladen petric free-kick , but guerrero reacted quickly to rifle the loose ball past wiese .
werder recovered quickly and a naldo free-kick flashed just wide of the post before the visitors were back on level terms in the 24th minute from another set-piece .
bastian reinhardt clipped diego 's heels just outside the area and the brazilian placed the free-kick wide of the wall and keeper frank rost , who got a hand to the ball but was unable to stop the shot .
spectator causes injury bildunterschrift : baumann , right , was injured by a thrown object werder captain frank baumann needed treatment after being struck in the face by an object - believed to be a battery - thrown from the crowd while joining diego and team-mates to celebrate the goal near the corner flag .
" it hit me on just above the left eye-brow .
it was a shock and painful .
there was a little bit of blood but it did n't hinder me , " baumann said .
hamburg sports director dietmar beiersdorfer said : " i want to apologize in the name of sv hamburg .
we do n't know who it was but that sort of thing should n't happen . "
neither side looked capable of fashioning a chance until olic 's goal , which triggered some desperate efforts by bremen to get back in the game .
but it was hamburg who came closest when piotr trochowski was through in stoppage time only for his shot to be saved by wiese .
" i ca n't say the win was deserved but i am very pleased , " hamburg coach martin jol said .
" we started well enough .
the first 10 minutes were good but then werder were the better side even though they did n't have any chances . "
bremen coach thomas schaaf said : " we did n't get as much out of the game as we put into it .
we played well but could n't turn our superiority in midfield into goals . "

24 against rushing into adopting a europe-wide economic stimulus package and ruled out reducing value-added tax in germany after talks with french president sarkozy . speaking after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , merkel said the seriousness of the current economic downturn called for a timely and measured approach to the situation .
" the risk that we are running today , taking into account information that is not always easy -lrb- to interpret -rrb- , is that we mistake haste for action , " she said .
vat cuts ' not right ' for germany both sarkozy and merkel also said their countries would not undertake a uk-style slashing of value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to stimulate spending as a way of fighting the financial crisis .
" a lower vat is not the right solution for france and germany , " merkel said .
" we are both agreed . "
sarkozy said lowering vat may be a viable option for other countries , such as britain , but agreed that it was a wrong fit for paris and berlin .
" when we lower the vat , what does that bring ?
only lower prices , " sarkozy said .
" we think other measures , such as emphasizing innovation and research , would be more effective for our economies . "
however , in his successful campaign for the 2007 presidential election , sarkozy vowed that he would convince the eu to allow france to lower its vat , particularly for french restaurants , where the tax is 19.6 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vat cuts would just reduce profits for businesses like restaurants but germany has repeatedly vetoed the proposal in brussels , claiming that lowering the vat in france to the proposed 5.5 percent would give french restaurants an unfair competitive advantage over german eateries , where vat is 19 percent .
europe-wide package the talks were part of regular joint-cabinet meetings between the french and german governments .
sarkozy was also to use the discussion as an opportunity to persuade merkel of the merits of a europe-wide economic stimulus package to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany has steadfastly rejected contributing a larger slice of its profits for europe .
the french president said nonetheless there was " much more agreement than disagreement " between the two sides on how to re-launch their economies .
" we acted together on the crisis .
we made the same analysis , " sarkozy said .
heat is on germany germany , as europe 's largest and the world 's third largest economy , has been under pressure in recent weeks to do more to help kick-start the european economy .
merkel 's government has already pledged 1.3 percent of gdp to energize the german economy , but brussels is to request a further 1 percent of gdp to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany 's contribution would translate to around 25 billion euros .
the stimulus package plan is to be unveiled by the european commission on wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .
but berlin has insisted it was already doing enough and need n't contribute further funds to reinvigorate europe 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are one of several focuses of the government stimulus package germany unveiled a 32-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- package for its economy on wednesday , nov .
5 , involving tax cuts , infrastructure projects and cheap corporate loans .
the deal equates to roughly 1.3 percent of german gdp .
the money is to be focussed on the hardest-hit sectors such as automobile manufacturing and construction .
a spokesman for chancellor merkel said that germany would be disadvantaged if it contributed another one percent of gdp on top of the existing 1.3 percent already pledged .
" nations that have already acted in recent weeks should not be punished for it , while those who have done nothing end up better off , " he said thursday , nov .

a full 35 percent would support rules allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients end their lives . the anonymous survey of 483 doctors was conducted for the german news magazine der spiegel .
a full 40 percent of doctors indicated they could imagine helping a patient end his or her life , the survey found .
and 16 percent of doctors said they could envision themselves taking the lead role in helping a patient commit suicide .
assisted suicide became a hot topic in germany earlier this year after roger kusch , an ex-senator in hamburg , advised an elderly woman on how to prepare a deadly cocktail of drugs .
in the wake of the woman 's suicide , politicians have called for laws that would make it illegal for anyone to help someone kill themselves or give them advice on how to do so .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most doctors have little training in end-of-life care in germany , assisted suicide is illegal , as long as no one physically helps end the person 's life .
but doctor-assisted suicide is widely viewed in germany as violating the code of professional medical conduct and is seen as going against doctors ' legal duties to save lives .
assisted suicide also has also been stigmatized due to the nazi eugenics programs which killed more than 70,000 mentally ill and handicapped people .
hospice organization decries attitude in the survey , 44.5 percent of the doctors said that if they were in the situation of being terminally ill , they would want a colleague to be allowed to help them commit suicide .
nearly one in three said they would want " active " help from a doctor .
germany 's hospice organization said that the results show the need for more ethical training for the medical profession and more money for terminal care .
for the german hospice association , the survey shows " what a bad handle doctors have on ethical and medical questions . "
only four percent of terminally ill patients had access to professional end-of-life care in the last 12 months before their deaths , said eugen brysch , who heads the hospice association .
he said that many doctors can not differentiate between " allowing someone to die " and " killing " someone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 24.11.2008 survey : many german doctors support assisted suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethical concerns keep most doctors from assisting with suicides a new survey shows that a surprising number of german doctors have no moral qualms about assisted suicide .
a full 35 percent would support rules allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients end their lives . the anonymous survey of 483 doctors was conducted for the german news magazine der spiegel .
a full 40 percent of doctors indicated they could imagine helping a patient end his or her life , the survey found .
and 16 percent of doctors said they could envision themselves taking the lead role in helping a patient commit suicide .
assisted suicide became a hot topic in germany earlier this year after roger kusch , an ex-senator in hamburg , advised an elderly woman on how to prepare a deadly cocktail of drugs .
in the wake of the woman 's suicide , politicians have called for laws that would make it illegal for anyone to help someone kill themselves or give them advice on how to do so .
violation of medical ethics the doctors taking part in the survey were general practitioners , oncologists , internists , anesthesiologists or palliative medicine practitioners who deal with extremely ill patients in hospitals .
the survey found that 3.3 percent admitted to having helped patients commit suicide on one or more occasions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most doctors have little training in end-of-life care in germany , assisted suicide is illegal , as long as no one physically helps end the person 's life .
but doctor-assisted suicide is widely viewed in germany as violating the code of professional medical conduct and is seen as going against doctors ' legal duties to save lives .
assisted suicide also has also been stigmatized due to the nazi eugenics programs which killed more than 70,000 mentally ill and handicapped people .
hospice organization decries attitude in the survey , 44.5 percent of the doctors said that if they were in the situation of being terminally ill , they would want a colleague to be allowed to help them commit suicide .
nearly one in three said they would want " active " help from a doctor .

their breakthrough was made possible by studies in the late 1990s revealing that some people were resistant to hiv / aids , according to a report in new scientist magazine on the berlin hematologists ' discovery .
in these people , the virus can not enter and destroy the white blood cells that it infects and destroys in most other people .
they owed their resistance to a mutation in the gene which makes the molecular " door handle " by which hiv / aids gains access to cells .

to treat the leukemia , the two doctors did the usual thing and sought a bone marrow donor to replenish the patient 's blood supply following chemotherapy to kill the existing , cancerous blood cells .
but the berlin doctors ' new approach was to get a donor who had the double hiv-resistant ccr5 mutation .
this meant that the patient 's replenished blood system would effectively be resistant to hiv / aids , locking out the virus for good .
this is what appears to have happened , according to the new scientist analysis , and huetter declared his patient " functionally cured . "
building on previous attempts several attempts to use bone marrow transplants in hiv / aids treatment have been made since the 1980s .

it was not known if something in the transplant had protected him .

meanwhile , media reports speculate that a real madrid representative was due in munich this week to talk to 24-year-old midfielder schweinsteiger , who can leave on a free transfer in summer and has also been linked with a handful of italian clubs .
podolski and schweinsteiger were the toast of the germany team at the 2006 world cup .
despite their age they have already won 60 and 62 national team caps , respectively .
poldi 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has spent more time on bayern 's bench than on the park but while schweinsteiger has been a regular starter at bayern under new coach juergen klinsmann , striker podolski has been unable to secure a regular first-team birth .
podolski came to munich from cologne in 2006 for 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.6 million -rrb- but has played just 58 games and scored a meagre 12 goals , far less than the 31 he has netted for germany .
furthermore , he has been made to stand in the shadow of italian international luca toni and fellow germany national team representative miroslav klose .
" i have told those responsible that i want to leave -lrb- the club -rrb- in winter , " podolski was quoted as telling the " bild " daily .
podolski has been frequently linked with a return to his home club cologne , but bayern general manager uli hoeness reiterated on the weekend that no player would leave during the winter break .
schweini draws italian , spanish eyes bayern have started talks with schweinsteiger about a contract renewal beyond 2009 but appear to face more and more interest from rivals clubs abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger has drawn much interest from abroad sports magazine " kicker " reported that real 's technical director miguel angel portugal was scheduled to meet the player and his representatives this week .
meanwhile , italy 's " la gazzetta dello sport " has linked schweinsteiger with a move to juventus .
the report said juve had prepared an offer for a four-year contract and an annual salary of 3.5 million euros should schweinsteiger decide to part ways with munich .
ac milan are reportedly also after the midfielder despite speculation that bayern could be ready to almost double his current salary of an estimated at 3 million euros .
schweinsteiger has stated he would talk with bayern first but that he could also imagine playing in another country . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , media reports speculate that a real madrid representative was due in munich this week to talk to 24-year-old midfielder schweinsteiger , who can leave on a free transfer in summer and has also been linked with a handful of italian clubs .
podolski and schweinsteiger were the toast of the germany team at the 2006 world cup .
despite their age they have already won 60 and 62 national team caps , respectively .
poldi 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has spent more time on bayern 's bench than on the park but while schweinsteiger has been a regular starter at bayern under new coach juergen klinsmann , striker podolski has been unable to secure a regular first-team birth .
podolski came to munich from cologne in 2006 for 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.6 million -rrb- but has played just 58 games and scored a meagre 12 goals , far less than the 31 he has netted for germany .
furthermore , he has been made to stand in the shadow of italian international luca toni and fellow germany national team representative miroslav klose .
" i have told those responsible that i want to leave -lrb- the club -rrb- in winter , " podolski was quoted as telling the " bild " daily .
podolski has been frequently linked with a return to his home club cologne , but bayern general manager uli hoeness reiterated on the weekend that no player would leave during the winter break .
schweini draws italian , spanish eyes bayern have started talks with schweinsteiger about a contract renewal beyond 2009 but appear to face more and more interest from rivals clubs abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger has drawn much interest from abroad sports magazine " kicker " reported that real 's technical director miguel angel portugal was scheduled to meet the player and his representatives this week .
meanwhile , italy 's " la gazzetta dello sport " has linked schweinsteiger with a move to juventus .
the report said juve had prepared an offer for a four-year contract and an annual salary of 3.5 million euros should schweinsteiger decide to part ways with munich .
ac milan are reportedly also after the midfielder despite speculation that bayern could be ready to almost double his current salary of an estimated at 3 million euros .
schweinsteiger has stated he would talk with bayern first but that he could also imagine playing in another country . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their breakthrough was made possible by studies in the late 1990s revealing that some people were resistant to hiv / aids , according to a report in new scientist magazine on the berlin hematologists ' discovery .
in these people , the virus can not enter and destroy the white blood cells that it infects and destroys in most other people .
they owed their resistance to a mutation in the gene which makes the molecular " door handle " by which hiv / aids gains access to cells .
called ccr5 , the protein door handle was misshapen in the immune individuals , locking hiv / aids out of their white blood cells , the new scientist report noted .

to treat the leukemia , the two doctors did the usual thing and sought a bone marrow donor to replenish the patient 's blood supply following chemotherapy to kill the existing , cancerous blood cells .
but the berlin doctors ' new approach was to get a donor who had the double hiv-resistant ccr5 mutation .
this meant that the patient 's replenished blood system would effectively be resistant to hiv / aids , locking out the virus for good .
this is what appears to have happened , according to the new scientist analysis , and huetter declared his patient " functionally cured . "
building on previous attempts several attempts to use bone marrow transplants in hiv / aids treatment have been made since the 1980s .
in one case , a patient with both hiv / aids and lymphoma died of the cancer two months later , but was found to harbor no hiv / aids .
it was not known if something in the transplant had protected him .

for helping to better the world for others like her , mam received the roland berger human dignity award monday . “ myself acquainted with misfortune , i learn to help the unfortunate ” - so said the poet virgil over 2000 years ago .
the saying , however , is one that could have come from the mouth of somaly mam , a cambodian woman who lived through slavery and prostitution as a child and faced every conceivable form of violence .
having escaped that misfortune , mam now uses her horrendous life experience to help fight for the rights of other young women who have been in her situation .
twelve years ago , she founded an ngo for women and children who were used as sex slaves called afesip , or acting for women in distressing situations .
on monday , november 24 , german president horst koehler recognized mam 's work by presenting her with the roland berger human dignity award .
the award , intended for those who work in the field of human rights and financed by the roland berger foundation , is endowed with a million euros .
this is the first year the prize has been awarded .
childhood over at ten born around 38 years ago to parents she would never know , mam was raised by foster parents in the eastern cambodian province of mondolkiri .
at the age of 10 , she moved in with an older man whom she referred to as “ grandpa ” and began her work as a domestic slave to the attentive man .
her childhood ended then ; running the home became her most important duty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mam says cambodian women and children have no say in their lives four or five years later , mam was handed over by “ grandpa ” to a man twelve years her senior , forced to marry to settle an outstanding debt .
that her grandfather had made such a decision about her life , her body and her destiny is something she did n't question .
“ in cambodia , women do n't have the right to say no , ” she said .
“ women and children must sacrifice their entire life to the family . ”
her husband disappeared shortly after their marriage and “ grandpa ” then brought her to a bordello in the cambodian capitol of phnom penh .
“ i thought i owed him something .
he fed me so i thought i had to be thankful and do everything for him . ”
trust fell by the wayside the years following saw mam held as a sex slave .
in those years , violence , malnutrition , abuse and drugs intertwined .
attempts at escape were always hindered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodia 's red light district attracts sex toursists from around the world “ my pimp would catch me and barricade me in a cage with snakes , ” mam recalls .
the memory floods the beautiful woman 's brown eyes with tears when she relates it even today . still , she speaks and writes about her experiences often .
her memoir , “ the road of lost innocence ” was published two years ago .
" i can smile and speak today , but deep in my heart , i do n't feel as normal as you , ” she told guests at the book 's launch party .
“ i do n't know how to love another person .
i do n't know how to trust anyone . ”
mam has , however , learned to trust at least one man : pierre legros , a frenchman she met in cambodia who helped her to flee from the brothel .
she went with him to france , married him and later returned with him to cambodia , where she founded afesip .
the organization and its workers , with support from unicef , have thus far freed a thousand women and children from forced prostitution .
afesip helps them to win back their self-confidence , to re-enter the community , to read and write and later , to train for future careers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literacy is one area afesip focuses on every time mam helps a young girl , she is faced once again with her own fortune and sees the pain and suffering in them reflecting back at her like a mirror .
it 's an immense burden but also an advantage , mam believes .
“ if i had n't had the experiences that i 'd had , i could n't have been able to help these young girls so well . ”
threats an everyday experience the necessity of mam 's work is clearly shown when one looks at the horrific statistics concerning sex slavery in cambodia .
a un report estimates that 50,000 women and young girls are victims of sexual violence every day .
ninety percent of children freed from brothels have tested positive for hiv .
the country ranks as a top destination for sex tourists , which supports a continuation of forced slavery and human trafficking .
still , not everyone agrees with mam 's work .
she 's publicly attacked politicians and businessmen in her homeland for their involvement in corruption and prostitution .
threats of murder and verbal attacks at the “ whistleblower ” are an everyday part of life for mam , as are muggings and kidnappings .
but she wo n't let that stop her .
“ every day , when i see these victims , these women who have been abused , who have so much pain , i know i simply ca n't turn my back on them .
i have to fight with all my power .
i will never give up .
never . ” anja koch -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , media reports speculate that a real madrid representative was due in munich this week to talk to 24-year-old midfielder schweinsteiger , who can leave on a free transfer in summer and has also been linked with a handful of italian clubs .
podolski and schweinsteiger were the toast of the germany team at the 2006 world cup .
despite their age they have already won 60 and 62 national team caps , respectively .
poldi 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has spent more time on bayern 's bench than on the park but while schweinsteiger has been a regular starter at bayern under new coach juergen klinsmann , striker podolski has been unable to secure a regular first-team birth .
podolski came to munich from cologne in 2006 for 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.6 million -rrb- but has played just 58 games and scored a meagre 12 goals , far less than the 31 he has netted for germany .
furthermore , he has been made to stand in the shadow of italian international luca toni and fellow germany national team representative miroslav klose .
" i have told those responsible that i want to leave -lrb- the club -rrb- in winter , " podolski was quoted as telling the " bild " daily .
podolski has been frequently linked with a return to his home club cologne , but bayern general manager uli hoeness reiterated on the weekend that no player would leave during the winter break .
schweini draws italian , spanish eyes bayern have started talks with schweinsteiger about a contract renewal beyond 2009 but appear to face more and more interest from rivals clubs abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger has drawn much interest from abroad sports magazine " kicker " reported that real 's technical director miguel angel portugal was scheduled to meet the player and his representatives this week .
meanwhile , italy 's " la gazzetta dello sport " has linked schweinsteiger with a move to juventus .
the report said juve had prepared an offer for a four-year contract and an annual salary of 3.5 million euros should schweinsteiger decide to part ways with munich .
ac milan are reportedly also after the midfielder despite speculation that bayern could be ready to almost double his current salary of an estimated at 3 million euros .
schweinsteiger has stated he would talk with bayern first but that he could also imagine playing in another country . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 against rushing into adopting a europe-wide economic stimulus package and ruled out reducing value-added tax in germany after talks with french president sarkozy . speaking after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , merkel said the seriousness of the current economic downturn called for a timely and measured approach to the situation .
" the risk that we are running today , taking into account information that is not always easy -lrb- to interpret -rrb- , is that we mistake haste for action , " she said .
vat cuts ' not right ' for germany both sarkozy and merkel also said their countries would not undertake a uk-style slashing of value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to stimulate spending as a way of fighting the financial crisis .
" a lower vat is not the right solution for france and germany , " merkel said .
" we are both agreed . "
sarkozy said lowering vat may be a viable option for other countries , such as britain , but agreed that it was a wrong fit for paris and berlin .
" when we lower the vat , what does that bring ?
only lower prices , " sarkozy said .
" we think other measures , such as emphasizing innovation and research , would be more effective for our economies . "
however , in his successful campaign for the 2007 presidential election , sarkozy vowed that he would convince the eu to allow france to lower its vat , particularly for french restaurants , where the tax is 19.6 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vat cuts would just reduce profits for businesses like restaurants but germany has repeatedly vetoed the proposal in brussels , claiming that lowering the vat in france to the proposed 5.5 percent would give french restaurants an unfair competitive advantage over german eateries , where vat is 19 percent .

sarkozy was also to use the discussion as an opportunity to persuade merkel of the merits of a europe-wide economic stimulus package to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany has steadfastly rejected contributing a larger slice of its profits for europe .
the french president said nonetheless there was " much more agreement than disagreement " between the two sides on how to re-launch their economies .
" we acted together on the crisis .
we made the same analysis , " sarkozy said .
heat is on germany germany , as europe 's largest and the world 's third largest economy , has been under pressure in recent weeks to do more to help kick-start the european economy .
merkel 's government has already pledged 1.3 percent of gdp to energize the german economy , but brussels is to request a further 1 percent of gdp to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany 's contribution would translate to around 25 billion euros .
the stimulus package plan is to be unveiled by the european commission on wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .
but berlin has insisted it was already doing enough and need n't contribute further funds to reinvigorate europe 's economy .

the deal equates to roughly 1.3 percent of german gdp .

a spokesman for chancellor merkel said that germany would be disadvantaged if it contributed another one percent of gdp on top of the existing 1.3 percent already pledged .
" nations that have already acted in recent weeks should not be punished for it , while those who have done nothing end up better off , " he said thursday , nov .

for helping to better the world for others like her , mam received the roland berger human dignity award monday . “ myself acquainted with misfortune , i learn to help the unfortunate ” - so said the poet virgil over 2000 years ago .
the saying , however , is one that could have come from the mouth of somaly mam , a cambodian woman who lived through slavery and prostitution as a child and faced every conceivable form of violence .
having escaped that misfortune , mam now uses her horrendous life experience to help fight for the rights of other young women who have been in her situation .
twelve years ago , she founded an ngo for women and children who were used as sex slaves called afesip , or acting for women in distressing situations .
on monday , november 24 , german president horst koehler recognized mam 's work by presenting her with the roland berger human dignity award .
the award , intended for those who work in the field of human rights and financed by the roland berger foundation , is endowed with a million euros .
this is the first year the prize has been awarded .
childhood over at ten born around 38 years ago to parents she would never know , mam was raised by foster parents in the eastern cambodian province of mondolkiri .
at the age of 10 , she moved in with an older man whom she referred to as “ grandpa ” and began her work as a domestic slave to the attentive man .
her childhood ended then ; running the home became her most important duty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mam says cambodian women and children have no say in their lives four or five years later , mam was handed over by “ grandpa ” to a man twelve years her senior , forced to marry to settle an outstanding debt .
that her grandfather had made such a decision about her life , her body and her destiny is something she did n't question .
“ in cambodia , women do n't have the right to say no , ” she said .
“ women and children must sacrifice their entire life to the family . ”
her husband disappeared shortly after their marriage and “ grandpa ” then brought her to a bordello in the cambodian capitol of phnom penh .
“ i thought i owed him something .
he fed me so i thought i had to be thankful and do everything for him . ”
trust fell by the wayside the years following saw mam held as a sex slave .
in those years , violence , malnutrition , abuse and drugs intertwined .
attempts at escape were always hindered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodia 's red light district attracts sex toursists from around the world “ my pimp would catch me and barricade me in a cage with snakes , ” mam recalls .
the memory floods the beautiful woman 's brown eyes with tears when she relates it even today . still , she speaks and writes about her experiences often .
her memoir , “ the road of lost innocence ” was published two years ago .
" i can smile and speak today , but deep in my heart , i do n't feel as normal as you , ” she told guests at the book 's launch party .
“ i do n't know how to love another person .
i do n't know how to trust anyone . ”
mam has , however , learned to trust at least one man : pierre legros , a frenchman she met in cambodia who helped her to flee from the brothel .
she went with him to france , married him and later returned with him to cambodia , where she founded afesip .
the organization and its workers , with support from unicef , have thus far freed a thousand women and children from forced prostitution .
afesip helps them to win back their self-confidence , to re-enter the community , to read and write and later , to train for future careers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literacy is one area afesip focuses on every time mam helps a young girl , she is faced once again with her own fortune and sees the pain and suffering in them reflecting back at her like a mirror .
it 's an immense burden but also an advantage , mam believes .
“ if i had n't had the experiences that i 'd had , i could n't have been able to help these young girls so well . ”
threats an everyday experience the necessity of mam 's work is clearly shown when one looks at the horrific statistics concerning sex slavery in cambodia .
a un report estimates that 50,000 women and young girls are victims of sexual violence every day .
ninety percent of children freed from brothels have tested positive for hiv .
the country ranks as a top destination for sex tourists , which supports a continuation of forced slavery and human trafficking .
still , not everyone agrees with mam 's work .
she 's publicly attacked politicians and businessmen in her homeland for their involvement in corruption and prostitution .
threats of murder and verbal attacks at the “ whistleblower ” are an everyday part of life for mam , as are muggings and kidnappings .
but she wo n't let that stop her .
“ every day , when i see these victims , these women who have been abused , who have so much pain , i know i simply ca n't turn my back on them .
i have to fight with all my power .
i will never give up .
never . ” anja koch -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 against rushing into adopting a europe-wide economic stimulus package and ruled out reducing value-added tax in germany after talks with french president sarkozy . speaking after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , merkel said the seriousness of the current economic downturn called for a timely and measured approach to the situation .
" the risk that we are running today , taking into account information that is not always easy -lrb- to interpret -rrb- , is that we mistake haste for action , " she said .

" a lower vat is not the right solution for france and germany , " merkel said .
" we are both agreed . "
sarkozy said lowering vat may be a viable option for other countries , such as britain , but agreed that it was a wrong fit for paris and berlin .
" when we lower the vat , what does that bring ?
only lower prices , " sarkozy said .
" we think other measures , such as emphasizing innovation and research , would be more effective for our economies . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vat cuts would just reduce profits for businesses like restaurants but germany has repeatedly vetoed the proposal in brussels , claiming that lowering the vat in france to the proposed 5.5 percent would give french restaurants an unfair competitive advantage over german eateries , where vat is 19 percent .

germany has steadfastly rejected contributing a larger slice of its profits for europe .
the french president said nonetheless there was " much more agreement than disagreement " between the two sides on how to re-launch their economies .
" we acted together on the crisis .
we made the same analysis , " sarkozy said .

merkel 's government has already pledged 1.3 percent of gdp to energize the german economy , but brussels is to request a further 1 percent of gdp to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany 's contribution would translate to around 25 billion euros .
the stimulus package plan is to be unveiled by the european commission on wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 24.11.2008 eu , nato concerned as kaczynski accuses russia of shooting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski , left , and georgia 's saakashvili were quick to point the finger at russia nato and the eu have expressed concern after shots were fired sunday at a convoy carrying the georgian and polish presidents near south ossetia .
poland 's leader lech kaczynski later pointed the finger at russia . at a joint press conference , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and eu foreign policy head javier solana stopped short of pointing the finger of blame at russia , despite moscow and tbilisi trading accusations over the shooting , seemingly aimed at either georgian president mikheil saakashvili or polish president lech kaczynski .
" i do n't know exactly what happened , " de hoop scheffer said .
" it is wrong and certainly not in the spirit of the -lrb- ceasefire -rrb- agreement , " which ended the brief war between georgia and russian in august , he added .
" we are not blaming anyone , but i blame certainly those who started the shooting . "
georgia , however , has blamed russian troops stationed near south ossetia of opening fire as the presidential convoy drove past , a charge russia has denied .
georgia was celebrating the fifth anniversary of its pro-western rose revolution .
" we are in contact with the -lrb- eu -rrb- monitors , " in georgia and " we will see later today " what the observer mission reports on the incident , the eu 's solana said .
polish president points the finger at russia kaczynski on monday blamed russia for firing on the convoy , despite moscow 's denials .
" there is reason to believe that the russians did the shooting , " kaczynski told reporters after returning from his visit to georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski made it clear who he thinks is responsible " i knew in advance that there was a russian post there , one which should n't have been there " under the terms of august 's ceasefire between moscow and tbilisi , kaczynski said .
" i wanted to check on site , and three or four kalashnikov volleys were fired off - though i 'm not saying they were fired in my direction , " he said .
" the russians , of course , are talking about a set-up by the georgians , " he added .
moscow and tbilisi have traded accusations over the incident near the convoy carrying saakashvili and his staunch ally kaczynski sunday , as georgia marked the fifth anniversary of its pro-western " rose revolution . "
georgia accused russian troops near the breakaway region of south ossetia of opening fire as the convoy carrying the two leaders drove by - a claim russia denied .
in warsaw monday , foreign ministers from the visegrad group of states including the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia as well as the three eu baltic states , bulgaria , romania and sweden condemned the incident and called for an investigation .
" the ministers express deepest concern and strongly condemn the incident in georgia on 23 november 2008 when machine-gun fire was opened in immediate vicinity of a motorcade carrying the presidents of georgia and poland , close to south ossetia , georgia , " the minister said in a joint statement .
" the ministers call for proper investigation and clarification of the incident , " it said .
nato chief dispels rumors of naval blockade in somalia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has no plans to set up a naval blockade de hoop scheffer also used the press conference to dispel notions nato was considering a naval blockade to counter pirates in waters off somalia .
" blocking ports is not contemplated by nato , " he told reporters .
he said a blockade did not have the backing of the un security council .
" this is , at the moment , not on the cards . "
an eu mission , dubbed atalanta , is to assume patrol duties off somalia in mid-december from a four-vessel nato fleet that has been protecting food aid shipments to the horn of africa .
military top brass warns of afghanistan failure also monday , nato 's top military commander , general bantz j. craddock , said a stabilization of afghanistan would not happen unless the alliance boosted its troop presence by 40 percent - around 20,000 more soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato forces in afghanistan need a boost , says craddock the united states is set to deploy an extra brigade of up to 5,000 men to afghanistan in 2009 , and " we are looking at how to resource a request from -lrb- nato -rrb- command in afghanistan -rrb- for three more brigades , " craddock said at nato headquarters in belgium .
nato currently has just over 50,000 men in afghanistan under the un-mandated international security assistance force , but they are facing an increasingly bloody challenge from the taliban , especially in the restive east and south of the country .
" where the security is problematic today is about the same places as it was a year ago ... but it is more virulent and it is at a higher tempo than it was last year , " craddock said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet many unanswered questions about the incident remain , including whether the men belonged to germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- . max stadler of the free democratic party told the berliner zeitung that he wanted a meeting of the parliamentary committee tasked with overseeing the bnd . " i expect the government and the heads of the bnd to inform the members of parliament , " stadler told the newspaper in an interview published monday , nov .

" i want to know if the arrestees are bnd employees . " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said monday that the suspects were not registered as intelligence agents . " i have no information on their accreditation .
they could have entered kosovo in a private capacity , " he said , declining to comment further while the investigation is in process . suspects remain jailed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three men have denied the allegations leveled against them , according to media reports lawyers of the men said prosecutors were trying to link their clients to " acts of terrorism , " punishable with up to 20 years in prison . " three german citizens suspected for the explosion ... have to stay one month in detention " the daily express reported sunday according to afp news agency . the kosovar paper added that the germans were " suspected of conducting a criminal act of terrorism . " attorney adem ademi told germany 's dpa news agency in pristina that " some documents " identifying the suspects as bnd agents bnd " were found and presented as evidence , " but he expressed doubts about the documents ' authenticity . asked whether the prosecutor identified the arrested germans as members of the bnd , ademi said : " they are suspected of being members of secret services , but they have n't said explicitly which one . " kosovo and german media reports have claimed the suspects were working for the bnd .
berlin officials have not commented on the allegations . pristina power struggle german terrorism and security expert elmar thevessen told dw-radio that problems within kosovo 's government might be responsible for the detention .
while some within the government support an eu mission that 's due to assume oversight of law-enforcement in kosovo after more than eight years as a united nations protectorate , others reject it . " it looks to me that it is a matter of political intrigue within kosovo , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense at all for the german intelligence service to get involved in a bomb going off in an office of the european union .
as a matter of fact the german government has been known to be one of the biggest supporters of that mission . " thevessen added that bnd agents were also investigating organized crime ties to the kosovo government and that this might be yet another reason why local officials were trying to get rid of them . agents claim innocence police arrested the three germans on wednesday , five days after an explosive device was hurled at the office of the eu 's special representative for the region .
no one was injured in the blast . the three germans said they were inspecting damage done by the bomb blast and were not involved in the attack , according to german media reports . german mass-tabloid bild reported sunday that the bomb attack had been the work of an anti-eu faction of kosovars . anti-eu faction in charge ? the paper said german foreign ministry officials on friday had won an assurance from the kosovo government that there would be no objection to releasing the trio arrested two days earlier . but the faction opposed to european union supervision of the new state won the upper hand on saturday , when the men were committed to custody . kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and pristina , belgrade , the un and eu are currently wrangling over the conditions for the deployment of the eu mission , eulex , comprising 2,000 police , judicial and customs officials . more than 50 states , including the united states and most eu members , have since recognized kosovo . dw staff -lrb- sms / win / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland 's leader lech kaczynski later pointed the finger at russia . at a joint press conference , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and eu foreign policy head javier solana stopped short of pointing the finger of blame at russia , despite moscow and tbilisi trading accusations over the shooting , seemingly aimed at either georgian president mikheil saakashvili or polish president lech kaczynski .
" i do n't know exactly what happened , " de hoop scheffer said .
" it is wrong and certainly not in the spirit of the -lrb- ceasefire -rrb- agreement , " which ended the brief war between georgia and russian in august , he added .
" we are not blaming anyone , but i blame certainly those who started the shooting . "
georgia , however , has blamed russian troops stationed near south ossetia of opening fire as the presidential convoy drove past , a charge russia has denied .
georgia was celebrating the fifth anniversary of its pro-western rose revolution .
" we are in contact with the -lrb- eu -rrb- monitors , " in georgia and " we will see later today " what the observer mission reports on the incident , the eu 's solana said .
polish president points the finger at russia kaczynski on monday blamed russia for firing on the convoy , despite moscow 's denials .
" there is reason to believe that the russians did the shooting , " kaczynski told reporters after returning from his visit to georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski made it clear who he thinks is responsible " i knew in advance that there was a russian post there , one which should n't have been there " under the terms of august 's ceasefire between moscow and tbilisi , kaczynski said .
" i wanted to check on site , and three or four kalashnikov volleys were fired off - though i 'm not saying they were fired in my direction , " he said .
" the russians , of course , are talking about a set-up by the georgians , " he added .
moscow and tbilisi have traded accusations over the incident near the convoy carrying saakashvili and his staunch ally kaczynski sunday , as georgia marked the fifth anniversary of its pro-western " rose revolution . "
georgia accused russian troops near the breakaway region of south ossetia of opening fire as the convoy carrying the two leaders drove by - a claim russia denied .
in warsaw monday , foreign ministers from the visegrad group of states including the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia as well as the three eu baltic states , bulgaria , romania and sweden condemned the incident and called for an investigation .
" the ministers express deepest concern and strongly condemn the incident in georgia on 23 november 2008 when machine-gun fire was opened in immediate vicinity of a motorcade carrying the presidents of georgia and poland , close to south ossetia , georgia , " the minister said in a joint statement .
" the ministers call for proper investigation and clarification of the incident , " it said .
nato chief dispels rumors of naval blockade in somalia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has no plans to set up a naval blockade de hoop scheffer also used the press conference to dispel notions nato was considering a naval blockade to counter pirates in waters off somalia .
" blocking ports is not contemplated by nato , " he told reporters .
he said a blockade did not have the backing of the un security council .
" this is , at the moment , not on the cards . "
an eu mission , dubbed atalanta , is to assume patrol duties off somalia in mid-december from a four-vessel nato fleet that has been protecting food aid shipments to the horn of africa .
military top brass warns of afghanistan failure also monday , nato 's top military commander , general bantz j. craddock , said a stabilization of afghanistan would not happen unless the alliance boosted its troop presence by 40 percent - around 20,000 more soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato forces in afghanistan need a boost , says craddock the united states is set to deploy an extra brigade of up to 5,000 men to afghanistan in 2009 , and " we are looking at how to resource a request from -lrb- nato -rrb- command in afghanistan -rrb- for three more brigades , " craddock said at nato headquarters in belgium .
nato currently has just over 50,000 men in afghanistan under the un-mandated international security assistance force , but they are facing an increasingly bloody challenge from the taliban , especially in the restive east and south of the country .
" where the security is problematic today is about the same places as it was a year ago ... but it is more virulent and it is at a higher tempo than it was last year , " craddock said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 24.11.2008 olic belter gives hamburg edge over rivals bremen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic , left , helped lead hamburg to victory ivica olic hit an unstoppable shot from outside the area to give sv hamburg a hard-fought 2-1 victory over werder bremen in the northern german derby on sunday , nov .
23 . the croatia striker left goalkeeper tim wiese with no chance when he cut in from the right and hammered a left-foot shot from the corner of the penalty area into the keeper 's top right-hand corner .
wiese had been met by jeers from hamburg fans for a studs-high challenge on olic in last season 's derby at hamburg - and the croatian provided the perfect response .
" i was surprised myself .
that was my best goal yet , but the most important thing was winning the three points , " olic said .
reconciliatory jersey swap olic said there had never been any hard feelings over wiese 's tackle last season , and the two demonstratively swapped shirts inside the stadium at the end of the game .
wiese said he could do nothing about olic 's 74th-minute strike into the angle of post and crossbar .
" i think it could be the goal of the year .
it was a super goal right into the top corner , " he said .
the goal settled a scrappy affair in which neither side was able to create much after paolo guerrero had given hamburg an early lead only for diego to level with a free-kick .
hamburg , who have not been beaten at home since the defeat by bremen late last season , are fifth on 26 points , five behind leaders hoffenheim , while bremen remain ninth on 20 points .
hamburg gained an early advantage when guerrero struck in the sixth minute to rifle the ball in from a narrow angle .
wiese did well to get down low at the near post to keep out a well-struck mladen petric free-kick , but guerrero reacted quickly to rifle the loose ball past wiese .
werder recovered quickly and a naldo free-kick flashed just wide of the post before the visitors were back on level terms in the 24th minute from another set-piece .
bastian reinhardt clipped diego 's heels just outside the area and the brazilian placed the free-kick wide of the wall and keeper frank rost , who got a hand to the ball but was unable to stop the shot .
spectator causes injury bildunterschrift : baumann , right , was injured by a thrown object werder captain frank baumann needed treatment after being struck in the face by an object - believed to be a battery - thrown from the crowd while joining diego and team-mates to celebrate the goal near the corner flag .
" it hit me on just above the left eye-brow .
it was a shock and painful .
there was a little bit of blood but it did n't hinder me , " baumann said .
hamburg sports director dietmar beiersdorfer said : " i want to apologize in the name of sv hamburg .
we do n't know who it was but that sort of thing should n't happen . "
neither side looked capable of fashioning a chance until olic 's goal , which triggered some desperate efforts by bremen to get back in the game .
but it was hamburg who came closest when piotr trochowski was through in stoppage time only for his shot to be saved by wiese .
" i ca n't say the win was deserved but i am very pleased , " hamburg coach martin jol said .
" we started well enough .
the first 10 minutes were good but then werder were the better side even though they did n't have any chances . "
bremen coach thomas schaaf said : " we did n't get as much out of the game as we put into it .
we played well but could n't turn our superiority in midfield into goals . "
weekend wrap-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim continued its winning ways on saturday , league top scorer vedad ibisevic struck twice as hoffenheim won 3-1 in cologne to go back on top of the table on 31 points .
leverkusen lost 2-1 at lowly arminia bielefeld to slip to second , level on 28 points with champions bayern munich , who defeated bottom club energie cottbus 4-1 .
hertha berlin are fourth on 27 points , a point above hamburg .

their breakthrough was made possible by studies in the late 1990s revealing that some people were resistant to hiv / aids , according to a report in new scientist magazine on the berlin hematologists ' discovery .
in these people , the virus can not enter and destroy the white blood cells that it infects and destroys in most other people .
they owed their resistance to a mutation in the gene which makes the molecular " door handle " by which hiv / aids gains access to cells .
called ccr5 , the protein door handle was misshapen in the immune individuals , locking hiv / aids out of their white blood cells , the new scientist report noted .
mutation in about one percent of europeans since the discovery , it has been established that about one percent of europeans have the same mutation , making them resistant to hiv / aids .

to treat the leukemia , the two doctors did the usual thing and sought a bone marrow donor to replenish the patient 's blood supply following chemotherapy to kill the existing , cancerous blood cells .
but the berlin doctors ' new approach was to get a donor who had the double hiv-resistant ccr5 mutation .
this meant that the patient 's replenished blood system would effectively be resistant to hiv / aids , locking out the virus for good .
this is what appears to have happened , according to the new scientist analysis , and huetter declared his patient " functionally cured . "
building on previous attempts several attempts to use bone marrow transplants in hiv / aids treatment have been made since the 1980s .
in one case , a patient with both hiv / aids and lymphoma died of the cancer two months later , but was found to harbor no hiv / aids .
it was not known if something in the transplant had protected him .

yet many unanswered questions about the incident remain , including whether the men belonged to germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- . max stadler of the free democratic party told the berliner zeitung that he wanted a meeting of the parliamentary committee tasked with overseeing the bnd . " i expect the government and the heads of the bnd to inform the members of parliament , " stadler told the newspaper in an interview published monday , nov .

" i want to know if the arrestees are bnd employees . " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said monday that the suspects were not registered as intelligence agents . " i have no information on their accreditation .

" a lower vat is not the right solution for france and germany , " merkel said .

sarkozy said lowering vat may be a viable option for other countries , such as britain , but agreed that it was a wrong fit for paris and berlin .
" when we lower the vat , what does that bring ?

merkel 's government has already pledged 1.3 percent of gdp to energize the german economy , but brussels is to request a further 1 percent of gdp to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany 's contribution would translate to around 25 billion euros .
the stimulus package plan is to be unveiled by the european commission on wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .

" moscow and tblisi exchanged accusations over an alleged shooting incident sunday , nov .
243 , near the breakaway province of south ossetia .
saakashvili accused russian troops of opening fire on a convoy he was riding in with kaczynski , forcing them to turn back .
" we heard machine-gun volleys about 30 meters -lrb- 100 feet -rrb- from where i was , " the polish pap news agency quoted kaczynski as saying .
automatic gunfire could be heard in shaky television footage but it was unclear where it was coming from .
georgia and russia trade blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president kaczynski backed georgia 's claim of shots fired georgia and russia , which fought a five-day war in august , accused each other of provocation over the incident .
" frankly i did n't expect the russians to open fire .
i thought they clearly saw that this was an official cortege , this was a high delegation , " georgian president mikheil saakashvili said , speaking in english in comments broadcast on bbc world service radio .
russian forces , he said , " were not happy to see us and reacted in this barbaric way . "
" clearly it was intended as a provocation , certainly i would never intend to put the life of the president of poland in danger , that was not my intention but the reality is that you know you are dealing with unpredictable people , " he added .
" aggression continues in georgia , " he said .
" the ceasefire and the european union-brokered agreement are being violated . "
kaczynski was less direct with his words at a news conference : " i appeal from this spot to my friends in the european union to draw the proper conclusions from this event before it is too late ...
i do not regret that trip along that dark road . "
russia : " this is a clear provocation " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , who was accompanying president dmitry medvedev on a trip to the peruvian capital lima for the asia-pacific summit , denied the allegation and accused georgia of deliberate provocation .
" this is a clear provocation , " he told reporters in the peruvian capital lima .
" it is not the first time they are doing so .
they are organizing the provocation and then blame the russian side . "
" when the president invites people to some kind of celebration in tbilisi and then takes a car and takes him to another state , is it not a provocation ?
of course it was , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the checkpoint soldiers were south ossetian , not russian , said one security chief " there was no kind of firing from our positions or south ossetian positions , " he added .
a south ossetian security chief , boris attojev , backed up that claim , telling russian newswire itar-tass that his soldiers stopped the polish-georgian convoy and explained that the border was closed , after which the motorcade left peacefully .
earlier sunday , russian deputy foreign minister grigory karasin had dismissed the claim as " one more instance of wishful thinking on the part of georgia . "
tensions remain high in south ossetia and in another breakaway region , abkhazia , following the august conflict .
russian forces had pushed into georgia - whose candidacy for nato membership is up for review in december - on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the pro-moscow breakaway region of south ossetia .
russian forces have pulled back from buffer zones into south ossetian territory and a 225-strong eu observation mission is monitoring a fragile ceasefire . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 . the croatia striker left goalkeeper tim wiese with no chance when he cut in from the right and hammered a left-foot shot from the corner of the penalty area into the keeper 's top right-hand corner .
wiese had been met by jeers from hamburg fans for a studs-high challenge on olic in last season 's derby at hamburg - and the croatian provided the perfect response .
" i was surprised myself .
that was my best goal yet , but the most important thing was winning the three points , " olic said .
reconciliatory jersey swap olic said there had never been any hard feelings over wiese 's tackle last season , and the two demonstratively swapped shirts inside the stadium at the end of the game .
wiese said he could do nothing about olic 's 74th-minute strike into the angle of post and crossbar .
" i think it could be the goal of the year .
it was a super goal right into the top corner , " he said .
the goal settled a scrappy affair in which neither side was able to create much after paolo guerrero had given hamburg an early lead only for diego to level with a free-kick .
hamburg , who have not been beaten at home since the defeat by bremen late last season , are fifth on 26 points , five behind leaders hoffenheim , while bremen remain ninth on 20 points .
hamburg gained an early advantage when guerrero struck in the sixth minute to rifle the ball in from a narrow angle .
wiese did well to get down low at the near post to keep out a well-struck mladen petric free-kick , but guerrero reacted quickly to rifle the loose ball past wiese .
werder recovered quickly and a naldo free-kick flashed just wide of the post before the visitors were back on level terms in the 24th minute from another set-piece .
bastian reinhardt clipped diego 's heels just outside the area and the brazilian placed the free-kick wide of the wall and keeper frank rost , who got a hand to the ball but was unable to stop the shot .
spectator causes injury bildunterschrift : baumann , right , was injured by a thrown object werder captain frank baumann needed treatment after being struck in the face by an object - believed to be a battery - thrown from the crowd while joining diego and team-mates to celebrate the goal near the corner flag .
" it hit me on just above the left eye-brow .
it was a shock and painful .
there was a little bit of blood but it did n't hinder me , " baumann said .
hamburg sports director dietmar beiersdorfer said : " i want to apologize in the name of sv hamburg .
we do n't know who it was but that sort of thing should n't happen . "
neither side looked capable of fashioning a chance until olic 's goal , which triggered some desperate efforts by bremen to get back in the game .
but it was hamburg who came closest when piotr trochowski was through in stoppage time only for his shot to be saved by wiese .
" i ca n't say the win was deserved but i am very pleased , " hamburg coach martin jol said .
" we started well enough .
the first 10 minutes were good but then werder were the better side even though they did n't have any chances . "
bremen coach thomas schaaf said : " we did n't get as much out of the game as we put into it .
we played well but could n't turn our superiority in midfield into goals . "

" i think it could be the goal of the year .
it was a super goal right into the top corner , " he said .
the goal settled a scrappy affair in which neither side was able to create much after paolo guerrero had given hamburg an early lead only for diego to level with a free-kick .
hamburg , who have not been beaten at home since the defeat by bremen late last season , are fifth on 26 points , five behind leaders hoffenheim , while bremen remain ninth on 20 points .
hamburg gained an early advantage when guerrero struck in the sixth minute to rifle the ball in from a narrow angle .
wiese did well to get down low at the near post to keep out a well-struck mladen petric free-kick , but guerrero reacted quickly to rifle the loose ball past wiese .
werder recovered quickly and a naldo free-kick flashed just wide of the post before the visitors were back on level terms in the 24th minute from another set-piece .
bastian reinhardt clipped diego 's heels just outside the area and the brazilian placed the free-kick wide of the wall and keeper frank rost , who got a hand to the ball but was unable to stop the shot .
spectator causes injury bildunterschrift : baumann , right , was injured by a thrown object werder captain frank baumann needed treatment after being struck in the face by an object - believed to be a battery - thrown from the crowd while joining diego and team-mates to celebrate the goal near the corner flag .
" it hit me on just above the left eye-brow .
it was a shock and painful .
there was a little bit of blood but it did n't hinder me , " baumann said .
hamburg sports director dietmar beiersdorfer said : " i want to apologize in the name of sv hamburg .
we do n't know who it was but that sort of thing should n't happen . "
neither side looked capable of fashioning a chance until olic 's goal , which triggered some desperate efforts by bremen to get back in the game .
but it was hamburg who came closest when piotr trochowski was through in stoppage time only for his shot to be saved by wiese .
" i ca n't say the win was deserved but i am very pleased , " hamburg coach martin jol said .
" we started well enough .
the first 10 minutes were good but then werder were the better side even though they did n't have any chances . "
bremen coach thomas schaaf said : " we did n't get as much out of the game as we put into it .
we played well but could n't turn our superiority in midfield into goals . "

meanwhile , media reports speculate that a real madrid representative was due in munich this week to talk to 24-year-old midfielder schweinsteiger , who can leave on a free transfer in summer and has also been linked with a handful of italian clubs .
podolski and schweinsteiger were the toast of the germany team at the 2006 world cup .
despite their age they have already won 60 and 62 national team caps , respectively .
poldi 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has spent more time on bayern 's bench than on the park but while schweinsteiger has been a regular starter at bayern under new coach juergen klinsmann , striker podolski has been unable to secure a regular first-team birth .
podolski came to munich from cologne in 2006 for 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.6 million -rrb- but has played just 58 games and scored a meagre 12 goals , far less than the 31 he has netted for germany .
furthermore , he has been made to stand in the shadow of italian international luca toni and fellow germany national team representative miroslav klose .
" i have told those responsible that i want to leave -lrb- the club -rrb- in winter , " podolski was quoted as telling the " bild " daily .
podolski has been frequently linked with a return to his home club cologne , but bayern general manager uli hoeness reiterated on the weekend that no player would leave during the winter break .
schweini draws italian , spanish eyes bayern have started talks with schweinsteiger about a contract renewal beyond 2009 but appear to face more and more interest from rivals clubs abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger has drawn much interest from abroad sports magazine " kicker " reported that real 's technical director miguel angel portugal was scheduled to meet the player and his representatives this week .
meanwhile , italy 's " la gazzetta dello sport " has linked schweinsteiger with a move to juventus .
the report said juve had prepared an offer for a four-year contract and an annual salary of 3.5 million euros should schweinsteiger decide to part ways with munich .
ac milan are reportedly also after the midfielder despite speculation that bayern could be ready to almost double his current salary of an estimated at 3 million euros .
schweinsteiger has stated he would talk with bayern first but that he could also imagine playing in another country . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , media reports speculate that a real madrid representative was due in munich this week to talk to 24-year-old midfielder schweinsteiger , who can leave on a free transfer in summer and has also been linked with a handful of italian clubs .
podolski and schweinsteiger were the toast of the germany team at the 2006 world cup .
despite their age they have already won 60 and 62 national team caps , respectively .
poldi 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has spent more time on bayern 's bench than on the park but while schweinsteiger has been a regular starter at bayern under new coach juergen klinsmann , striker podolski has been unable to secure a regular first-team birth .
podolski came to munich from cologne in 2006 for 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.6 million -rrb- but has played just 58 games and scored a meagre 12 goals , far less than the 31 he has netted for germany .
furthermore , he has been made to stand in the shadow of italian international luca toni and fellow germany national team representative miroslav klose .
" i have told those responsible that i want to leave -lrb- the club -rrb- in winter , " podolski was quoted as telling the " bild " daily .
podolski has been frequently linked with a return to his home club cologne , but bayern general manager uli hoeness reiterated on the weekend that no player would leave during the winter break .
schweini draws italian , spanish eyes bayern have started talks with schweinsteiger about a contract renewal beyond 2009 but appear to face more and more interest from rivals clubs abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger has drawn much interest from abroad sports magazine " kicker " reported that real 's technical director miguel angel portugal was scheduled to meet the player and his representatives this week .
meanwhile , italy 's " la gazzetta dello sport " has linked schweinsteiger with a move to juventus .
the report said juve had prepared an offer for a four-year contract and an annual salary of 3.5 million euros should schweinsteiger decide to part ways with munich .
ac milan are reportedly also after the midfielder despite speculation that bayern could be ready to almost double his current salary of an estimated at 3 million euros .

yet many unanswered questions about the incident remain , including whether the men belonged to germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- . max stadler of the free democratic party told the berliner zeitung that he wanted a meeting of the parliamentary committee tasked with overseeing the bnd . " i expect the government and the heads of the bnd to inform the members of parliament , " stadler told the newspaper in an interview published monday , nov .
24 .
" i want to know if the arrestees are bnd employees . " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said monday that the suspects were not registered as intelligence agents . " i have no information on their accreditation .
they could have entered kosovo in a private capacity , " he said , declining to comment further while the investigation is in process . suspects remain jailed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three men have denied the allegations leveled against them , according to media reports lawyers of the men said prosecutors were trying to link their clients to " acts of terrorism , " punishable with up to 20 years in prison . " three german citizens suspected for the explosion ... have to stay one month in detention " the daily express reported sunday according to afp news agency . the kosovar paper added that the germans were " suspected of conducting a criminal act of terrorism . " attorney adem ademi told germany 's dpa news agency in pristina that " some documents " identifying the suspects as bnd agents bnd " were found and presented as evidence , " but he expressed doubts about the documents ' authenticity . asked whether the prosecutor identified the arrested germans as members of the bnd , ademi said : " they are suspected of being members of secret services , but they have n't said explicitly which one . " kosovo and german media reports have claimed the suspects were working for the bnd .
berlin officials have not commented on the allegations . pristina power struggle german terrorism and security expert elmar thevessen told dw-radio that problems within kosovo 's government might be responsible for the detention .
while some within the government support an eu mission that 's due to assume oversight of law-enforcement in kosovo after more than eight years as a united nations protectorate , others reject it . " it looks to me that it is a matter of political intrigue within kosovo , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense at all for the german intelligence service to get involved in a bomb going off in an office of the european union .
as a matter of fact the german government has been known to be one of the biggest supporters of that mission . " thevessen added that bnd agents were also investigating organized crime ties to the kosovo government and that this might be yet another reason why local officials were trying to get rid of them . agents claim innocence police arrested the three germans on wednesday , five days after an explosive device was hurled at the office of the eu 's special representative for the region .
no one was injured in the blast . the three germans said they were inspecting damage done by the bomb blast and were not involved in the attack , according to german media reports . german mass-tabloid bild reported sunday that the bomb attack had been the work of an anti-eu faction of kosovars . anti-eu faction in charge ? the paper said german foreign ministry officials on friday had won an assurance from the kosovo government that there would be no objection to releasing the trio arrested two days earlier . but the faction opposed to european union supervision of the new state won the upper hand on saturday , when the men were committed to custody . kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and pristina , belgrade , the un and eu are currently wrangling over the conditions for the deployment of the eu mission , eulex , comprising 2,000 police , judicial and customs officials . more than 50 states , including the united states and most eu members , have since recognized kosovo . dw staff -lrb- sms / win / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i do n't know exactly what happened , " de hoop scheffer said .
" it is wrong and certainly not in the spirit of the -lrb- ceasefire -rrb- agreement , " which ended the brief war between georgia and russian in august , he added .
" we are not blaming anyone , but i blame certainly those who started the shooting . "
georgia , however , has blamed russian troops stationed near south ossetia of opening fire as the presidential convoy drove past , a charge russia has denied .
georgia was celebrating the fifth anniversary of its pro-western rose revolution .

their breakthrough was made possible by studies in the late 1990s revealing that some people were resistant to hiv / aids , according to a report in new scientist magazine on the berlin hematologists ' discovery .
in these people , the virus can not enter and destroy the white blood cells that it infects and destroys in most other people .
they owed their resistance to a mutation in the gene which makes the molecular " door handle " by which hiv / aids gains access to cells .
called ccr5 , the protein door handle was misshapen in the immune individuals , locking hiv / aids out of their white blood cells , the new scientist report noted .
mutation in about one percent of europeans since the discovery , it has been established that about one percent of europeans have the same mutation , making them resistant to hiv / aids .
to be resistant , they had to inherit the same mutation from both parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckhard thiel and gero huetter announced their discovery earlier this month huetter and thiel made use of this when treating their patient for leukemia , which he had developed in addition to hiv / aids .
to treat the leukemia , the two doctors did the usual thing and sought a bone marrow donor to replenish the patient 's blood supply following chemotherapy to kill the existing , cancerous blood cells .
but the berlin doctors ' new approach was to get a donor who had the double hiv-resistant ccr5 mutation .
this meant that the patient 's replenished blood system would effectively be resistant to hiv / aids , locking out the virus for good .
this is what appears to have happened , according to the new scientist analysis , and huetter declared his patient " functionally cured . "
building on previous attempts several attempts to use bone marrow transplants in hiv / aids treatment have been made since the 1980s .
in one case , a patient with both hiv / aids and lymphoma died of the cancer two months later , but was found to harbor no hiv / aids .
it was not known if something in the transplant had protected him .
and in a famous 1995 case , jeff getty , a prominent san francisco advocate for hiv / aids patients , received bone marrow from a baboon , which is resistant to the human virus .
the new york times reported that he survived for 11 years , but died of hiv / aids and cancer .
the times said the transplant had not protected him but anti-retroviral triple therapy had been invented in time to help .
hotter and thiel have been quick to say that it is far too early to speak of a widespread general cure for hiv / aids .
they stress that their breakthrough is a sound proof of principle , demonstrating that there is hope for treatments that literally lock hiv / aids out in the cold .
but they warn that an all-out cure for the millions of hiv / aids patients worldwide is still a long way off . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet many unanswered questions about the incident remain , including whether the men belonged to germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- . max stadler of the free democratic party told the berliner zeitung that he wanted a meeting of the parliamentary committee tasked with overseeing the bnd . " i expect the government and the heads of the bnd to inform the members of parliament , " stadler told the newspaper in an interview published monday , nov .
24 .
" i want to know if the arrestees are bnd employees . " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said monday that the suspects were not registered as intelligence agents . " i have no information on their accreditation .
they could have entered kosovo in a private capacity , " he said , declining to comment further while the investigation is in process . suspects remain jailed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three men have denied the allegations leveled against them , according to media reports lawyers of the men said prosecutors were trying to link their clients to " acts of terrorism , " punishable with up to 20 years in prison . " three german citizens suspected for the explosion ... have to stay one month in detention " the daily express reported sunday according to afp news agency . the kosovar paper added that the germans were " suspected of conducting a criminal act of terrorism . " attorney adem ademi told germany 's dpa news agency in pristina that " some documents " identifying the suspects as bnd agents bnd " were found and presented as evidence , " but he expressed doubts about the documents ' authenticity . asked whether the prosecutor identified the arrested germans as members of the bnd , ademi said : " they are suspected of being members of secret services , but they have n't said explicitly which one . " kosovo and german media reports have claimed the suspects were working for the bnd .
berlin officials have not commented on the allegations . pristina power struggle german terrorism and security expert elmar thevessen told dw-radio that problems within kosovo 's government might be responsible for the detention .
while some within the government support an eu mission that 's due to assume oversight of law-enforcement in kosovo after more than eight years as a united nations protectorate , others reject it . " it looks to me that it is a matter of political intrigue within kosovo , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense at all for the german intelligence service to get involved in a bomb going off in an office of the european union .
as a matter of fact the german government has been known to be one of the biggest supporters of that mission . " thevessen added that bnd agents were also investigating organized crime ties to the kosovo government and that this might be yet another reason why local officials were trying to get rid of them . agents claim innocence police arrested the three germans on wednesday , five days after an explosive device was hurled at the office of the eu 's special representative for the region .

a full 35 percent would support rules allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients end their lives . the anonymous survey of 483 doctors was conducted for the german news magazine der spiegel .
a full 40 percent of doctors indicated they could imagine helping a patient end his or her life , the survey found .
and 16 percent of doctors said they could envision themselves taking the lead role in helping a patient commit suicide .
assisted suicide became a hot topic in germany earlier this year after roger kusch , an ex-senator in hamburg , advised an elderly woman on how to prepare a deadly cocktail of drugs .
in the wake of the woman 's suicide , politicians have called for laws that would make it illegal for anyone to help someone kill themselves or give them advice on how to do so .
violation of medical ethics the doctors taking part in the survey were general practitioners , oncologists , internists , anesthesiologists or palliative medicine practitioners who deal with extremely ill patients in hospitals .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most doctors have little training in end-of-life care in germany , assisted suicide is illegal , as long as no one physically helps end the person 's life .

assisted suicide also has also been stigmatized due to the nazi eugenics programs which killed more than 70,000 mentally ill and handicapped people .
hospice organization decries attitude in the survey , 44.5 percent of the doctors said that if they were in the situation of being terminally ill , they would want a colleague to be allowed to help them commit suicide .
nearly one in three said they would want " active " help from a doctor .
germany 's hospice organization said that the results show the need for more ethical training for the medical profession and more money for terminal care .
for the german hospice association , the survey shows " what a bad handle doctors have on ethical and medical questions . "
only four percent of terminally ill patients had access to professional end-of-life care in the last 12 months before their deaths , said eugen brysch , who heads the hospice association .
he said that many doctors can not differentiate between " allowing someone to die " and " killing " someone .

their breakthrough was made possible by studies in the late 1990s revealing that some people were resistant to hiv / aids , according to a report in new scientist magazine on the berlin hematologists ' discovery .
in these people , the virus can not enter and destroy the white blood cells that it infects and destroys in most other people .
they owed their resistance to a mutation in the gene which makes the molecular " door handle " by which hiv / aids gains access to cells .
called ccr5 , the protein door handle was misshapen in the immune individuals , locking hiv / aids out of their white blood cells , the new scientist report noted .
mutation in about one percent of europeans since the discovery , it has been established that about one percent of europeans have the same mutation , making them resistant to hiv / aids .

to treat the leukemia , the two doctors did the usual thing and sought a bone marrow donor to replenish the patient 's blood supply following chemotherapy to kill the existing , cancerous blood cells .
but the berlin doctors ' new approach was to get a donor who had the double hiv-resistant ccr5 mutation .
this meant that the patient 's replenished blood system would effectively be resistant to hiv / aids , locking out the virus for good .
this is what appears to have happened , according to the new scientist analysis , and huetter declared his patient " functionally cured . "
building on previous attempts several attempts to use bone marrow transplants in hiv / aids treatment have been made since the 1980s .
in one case , a patient with both hiv / aids and lymphoma died of the cancer two months later , but was found to harbor no hiv / aids .
it was not known if something in the transplant had protected him .
and in a famous 1995 case , jeff getty , a prominent san francisco advocate for hiv / aids patients , received bone marrow from a baboon , which is resistant to the human virus .
the new york times reported that he survived for 11 years , but died of hiv / aids and cancer .
the times said the transplant had not protected him but anti-retroviral triple therapy had been invented in time to help .
hotter and thiel have been quick to say that it is far too early to speak of a widespread general cure for hiv / aids .
they stress that their breakthrough is a sound proof of principle , demonstrating that there is hope for treatments that literally lock hiv / aids out in the cold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 24.11.2008 olic belter gives hamburg edge over rivals bremen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic , left , helped lead hamburg to victory ivica olic hit an unstoppable shot from outside the area to give sv hamburg a hard-fought 2-1 victory over werder bremen in the northern german derby on sunday , nov .
23 . the croatia striker left goalkeeper tim wiese with no chance when he cut in from the right and hammered a left-foot shot from the corner of the penalty area into the keeper 's top right-hand corner .
wiese had been met by jeers from hamburg fans for a studs-high challenge on olic in last season 's derby at hamburg - and the croatian provided the perfect response .
" i was surprised myself .
that was my best goal yet , but the most important thing was winning the three points , " olic said .
reconciliatory jersey swap olic said there had never been any hard feelings over wiese 's tackle last season , and the two demonstratively swapped shirts inside the stadium at the end of the game .
wiese said he could do nothing about olic 's 74th-minute strike into the angle of post and crossbar .
" i think it could be the goal of the year .
it was a super goal right into the top corner , " he said .
the goal settled a scrappy affair in which neither side was able to create much after paolo guerrero had given hamburg an early lead only for diego to level with a free-kick .
hamburg , who have not been beaten at home since the defeat by bremen late last season , are fifth on 26 points , five behind leaders hoffenheim , while bremen remain ninth on 20 points .
hamburg gained an early advantage when guerrero struck in the sixth minute to rifle the ball in from a narrow angle .
wiese did well to get down low at the near post to keep out a well-struck mladen petric free-kick , but guerrero reacted quickly to rifle the loose ball past wiese .
werder recovered quickly and a naldo free-kick flashed just wide of the post before the visitors were back on level terms in the 24th minute from another set-piece .
bastian reinhardt clipped diego 's heels just outside the area and the brazilian placed the free-kick wide of the wall and keeper frank rost , who got a hand to the ball but was unable to stop the shot .
spectator causes injury bildunterschrift : baumann , right , was injured by a thrown object werder captain frank baumann needed treatment after being struck in the face by an object - believed to be a battery - thrown from the crowd while joining diego and team-mates to celebrate the goal near the corner flag .
" it hit me on just above the left eye-brow .
it was a shock and painful .
there was a little bit of blood but it did n't hinder me , " baumann said .
hamburg sports director dietmar beiersdorfer said : " i want to apologize in the name of sv hamburg .
we do n't know who it was but that sort of thing should n't happen . "
neither side looked capable of fashioning a chance until olic 's goal , which triggered some desperate efforts by bremen to get back in the game .
but it was hamburg who came closest when piotr trochowski was through in stoppage time only for his shot to be saved by wiese .
" i ca n't say the win was deserved but i am very pleased , " hamburg coach martin jol said .
" we started well enough .
the first 10 minutes were good but then werder were the better side even though they did n't have any chances . "
bremen coach thomas schaaf said : " we did n't get as much out of the game as we put into it .
we played well but could n't turn our superiority in midfield into goals . "

23 . the croatia striker left goalkeeper tim wiese with no chance when he cut in from the right and hammered a left-foot shot from the corner of the penalty area into the keeper 's top right-hand corner .
wiese had been met by jeers from hamburg fans for a studs-high challenge on olic in last season 's derby at hamburg - and the croatian provided the perfect response .
" i was surprised myself .
that was my best goal yet , but the most important thing was winning the three points , " olic said .
reconciliatory jersey swap olic said there had never been any hard feelings over wiese 's tackle last season , and the two demonstratively swapped shirts inside the stadium at the end of the game .
wiese said he could do nothing about olic 's 74th-minute strike into the angle of post and crossbar .
" i think it could be the goal of the year .
it was a super goal right into the top corner , " he said .
the goal settled a scrappy affair in which neither side was able to create much after paolo guerrero had given hamburg an early lead only for diego to level with a free-kick .
hamburg , who have not been beaten at home since the defeat by bremen late last season , are fifth on 26 points , five behind leaders hoffenheim , while bremen remain ninth on 20 points .
hamburg gained an early advantage when guerrero struck in the sixth minute to rifle the ball in from a narrow angle .
wiese did well to get down low at the near post to keep out a well-struck mladen petric free-kick , but guerrero reacted quickly to rifle the loose ball past wiese .
werder recovered quickly and a naldo free-kick flashed just wide of the post before the visitors were back on level terms in the 24th minute from another set-piece .
bastian reinhardt clipped diego 's heels just outside the area and the brazilian placed the free-kick wide of the wall and keeper frank rost , who got a hand to the ball but was unable to stop the shot .
spectator causes injury bildunterschrift : baumann , right , was injured by a thrown object werder captain frank baumann needed treatment after being struck in the face by an object - believed to be a battery - thrown from the crowd while joining diego and team-mates to celebrate the goal near the corner flag .
" it hit me on just above the left eye-brow .
it was a shock and painful .
there was a little bit of blood but it did n't hinder me , " baumann said .
hamburg sports director dietmar beiersdorfer said : " i want to apologize in the name of sv hamburg .
we do n't know who it was but that sort of thing should n't happen . "
neither side looked capable of fashioning a chance until olic 's goal , which triggered some desperate efforts by bremen to get back in the game .
but it was hamburg who came closest when piotr trochowski was through in stoppage time only for his shot to be saved by wiese .
" i ca n't say the win was deserved but i am very pleased , " hamburg coach martin jol said .
" we started well enough .
the first 10 minutes were good but then werder were the better side even though they did n't have any chances . "
bremen coach thomas schaaf said : " we did n't get as much out of the game as we put into it .
we played well but could n't turn our superiority in midfield into goals . "

it was a super goal right into the top corner , " he said .
the goal settled a scrappy affair in which neither side was able to create much after paolo guerrero had given hamburg an early lead only for diego to level with a free-kick .
hamburg , who have not been beaten at home since the defeat by bremen late last season , are fifth on 26 points , five behind leaders hoffenheim , while bremen remain ninth on 20 points .
hamburg gained an early advantage when guerrero struck in the sixth minute to rifle the ball in from a narrow angle .
wiese did well to get down low at the near post to keep out a well-struck mladen petric free-kick , but guerrero reacted quickly to rifle the loose ball past wiese .
werder recovered quickly and a naldo free-kick flashed just wide of the post before the visitors were back on level terms in the 24th minute from another set-piece .
bastian reinhardt clipped diego 's heels just outside the area and the brazilian placed the free-kick wide of the wall and keeper frank rost , who got a hand to the ball but was unable to stop the shot .
spectator causes injury bildunterschrift : baumann , right , was injured by a thrown object werder captain frank baumann needed treatment after being struck in the face by an object - believed to be a battery - thrown from the crowd while joining diego and team-mates to celebrate the goal near the corner flag .
" it hit me on just above the left eye-brow .
it was a shock and painful .
there was a little bit of blood but it did n't hinder me , " baumann said .
hamburg sports director dietmar beiersdorfer said : " i want to apologize in the name of sv hamburg .
we do n't know who it was but that sort of thing should n't happen . "
neither side looked capable of fashioning a chance until olic 's goal , which triggered some desperate efforts by bremen to get back in the game .
but it was hamburg who came closest when piotr trochowski was through in stoppage time only for his shot to be saved by wiese .
" i ca n't say the win was deserved but i am very pleased , " hamburg coach martin jol said .
" we started well enough .
the first 10 minutes were good but then werder were the better side even though they did n't have any chances . "
bremen coach thomas schaaf said : " we did n't get as much out of the game as we put into it .
we played well but could n't turn our superiority in midfield into goals . "

yet many unanswered questions about the incident remain , including whether the men belonged to germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- . max stadler of the free democratic party told the berliner zeitung that he wanted a meeting of the parliamentary committee tasked with overseeing the bnd . " i expect the government and the heads of the bnd to inform the members of parliament , " stadler told the newspaper in an interview published monday , nov .
24 .
" i want to know if the arrestees are bnd employees . " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said monday that the suspects were not registered as intelligence agents . " i have no information on their accreditation .
they could have entered kosovo in a private capacity , " he said , declining to comment further while the investigation is in process . suspects remain jailed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three men have denied the allegations leveled against them , according to media reports lawyers of the men said prosecutors were trying to link their clients to " acts of terrorism , " punishable with up to 20 years in prison . " three german citizens suspected for the explosion ... have to stay one month in detention " the daily express reported sunday according to afp news agency . the kosovar paper added that the germans were " suspected of conducting a criminal act of terrorism . " attorney adem ademi told germany 's dpa news agency in pristina that " some documents " identifying the suspects as bnd agents bnd " were found and presented as evidence , " but he expressed doubts about the documents ' authenticity . asked whether the prosecutor identified the arrested germans as members of the bnd , ademi said : " they are suspected of being members of secret services , but they have n't said explicitly which one . " kosovo and german media reports have claimed the suspects were working for the bnd .
berlin officials have not commented on the allegations . pristina power struggle german terrorism and security expert elmar thevessen told dw-radio that problems within kosovo 's government might be responsible for the detention .
while some within the government support an eu mission that 's due to assume oversight of law-enforcement in kosovo after more than eight years as a united nations protectorate , others reject it . " it looks to me that it is a matter of political intrigue within kosovo , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense at all for the german intelligence service to get involved in a bomb going off in an office of the european union .
as a matter of fact the german government has been known to be one of the biggest supporters of that mission . " thevessen added that bnd agents were also investigating organized crime ties to the kosovo government and that this might be yet another reason why local officials were trying to get rid of them . agents claim innocence police arrested the three germans on wednesday , five days after an explosive device was hurled at the office of the eu 's special representative for the region .
no one was injured in the blast . the three germans said they were inspecting damage done by the bomb blast and were not involved in the attack , according to german media reports . german mass-tabloid bild reported sunday that the bomb attack had been the work of an anti-eu faction of kosovars . anti-eu faction in charge ? the paper said german foreign ministry officials on friday had won an assurance from the kosovo government that there would be no objection to releasing the trio arrested two days earlier . but the faction opposed to european union supervision of the new state won the upper hand on saturday , when the men were committed to custody . kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and pristina , belgrade , the un and eu are currently wrangling over the conditions for the deployment of the eu mission , eulex , comprising 2,000 police , judicial and customs officials . more than 50 states , including the united states and most eu members , have since recognized kosovo . dw staff -lrb- sms / win / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 against rushing into adopting a europe-wide economic stimulus package and ruled out reducing value-added tax in germany after talks with french president sarkozy . speaking after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , merkel said the seriousness of the current economic downturn called for a timely and measured approach to the situation .
" the risk that we are running today , taking into account information that is not always easy -lrb- to interpret -rrb- , is that we mistake haste for action , " she said .
vat cuts ' not right ' for germany both sarkozy and merkel also said their countries would not undertake a uk-style slashing of value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to stimulate spending as a way of fighting the financial crisis .
" a lower vat is not the right solution for france and germany , " merkel said .
" we are both agreed . "
sarkozy said lowering vat may be a viable option for other countries , such as britain , but agreed that it was a wrong fit for paris and berlin .
" when we lower the vat , what does that bring ?
only lower prices , " sarkozy said .

24 against rushing into adopting a europe-wide economic stimulus package and ruled out reducing value-added tax in germany after talks with french president sarkozy . speaking after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , merkel said the seriousness of the current economic downturn called for a timely and measured approach to the situation .
" the risk that we are running today , taking into account information that is not always easy -lrb- to interpret -rrb- , is that we mistake haste for action , " she said .
vat cuts ' not right ' for germany both sarkozy and merkel also said their countries would not undertake a uk-style slashing of value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to stimulate spending as a way of fighting the financial crisis .
" a lower vat is not the right solution for france and germany , " merkel said .
" we are both agreed . "
sarkozy said lowering vat may be a viable option for other countries , such as britain , but agreed that it was a wrong fit for paris and berlin .
" when we lower the vat , what does that bring ?
only lower prices , " sarkozy said .
" we think other measures , such as emphasizing innovation and research , would be more effective for our economies . "
however , in his successful campaign for the 2007 presidential election , sarkozy vowed that he would convince the eu to allow france to lower its vat , particularly for french restaurants , where the tax is 19.6 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vat cuts would just reduce profits for businesses like restaurants but germany has repeatedly vetoed the proposal in brussels , claiming that lowering the vat in france to the proposed 5.5 percent would give french restaurants an unfair competitive advantage over german eateries , where vat is 19 percent .
europe-wide package the talks were part of regular joint-cabinet meetings between the french and german governments .
sarkozy was also to use the discussion as an opportunity to persuade merkel of the merits of a europe-wide economic stimulus package to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany has steadfastly rejected contributing a larger slice of its profits for europe .
the french president said nonetheless there was " much more agreement than disagreement " between the two sides on how to re-launch their economies .
" we acted together on the crisis .
we made the same analysis , " sarkozy said .
heat is on germany germany , as europe 's largest and the world 's third largest economy , has been under pressure in recent weeks to do more to help kick-start the european economy .
merkel 's government has already pledged 1.3 percent of gdp to energize the german economy , but brussels is to request a further 1 percent of gdp to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany 's contribution would translate to around 25 billion euros .
the stimulus package plan is to be unveiled by the european commission on wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .
but berlin has insisted it was already doing enough and need n't contribute further funds to reinvigorate europe 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers are one of several focuses of the government stimulus package germany unveiled a 32-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- package for its economy on wednesday , nov .
5 , involving tax cuts , infrastructure projects and cheap corporate loans .
the deal equates to roughly 1.3 percent of german gdp .
the money is to be focussed on the hardest-hit sectors such as automobile manufacturing and construction .
a spokesman for chancellor merkel said that germany would be disadvantaged if it contributed another one percent of gdp on top of the existing 1.3 percent already pledged .
" nations that have already acted in recent weeks should not be punished for it , while those who have done nothing end up better off , " he said thursday , nov .

meanwhile , media reports speculate that a real madrid representative was due in munich this week to talk to 24-year-old midfielder schweinsteiger , who can leave on a free transfer in summer and has also been linked with a handful of italian clubs .
podolski and schweinsteiger were the toast of the germany team at the 2006 world cup .
despite their age they have already won 60 and 62 national team caps , respectively .
poldi 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has spent more time on bayern 's bench than on the park but while schweinsteiger has been a regular starter at bayern under new coach juergen klinsmann , striker podolski has been unable to secure a regular first-team birth .
podolski came to munich from cologne in 2006 for 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.6 million -rrb- but has played just 58 games and scored a meagre 12 goals , far less than the 31 he has netted for germany .
furthermore , he has been made to stand in the shadow of italian international luca toni and fellow germany national team representative miroslav klose .
" i have told those responsible that i want to leave -lrb- the club -rrb- in winter , " podolski was quoted as telling the " bild " daily .
podolski has been frequently linked with a return to his home club cologne , but bayern general manager uli hoeness reiterated on the weekend that no player would leave during the winter break .
schweini draws italian , spanish eyes bayern have started talks with schweinsteiger about a contract renewal beyond 2009 but appear to face more and more interest from rivals clubs abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger has drawn much interest from abroad sports magazine " kicker " reported that real 's technical director miguel angel portugal was scheduled to meet the player and his representatives this week .
meanwhile , italy 's " la gazzetta dello sport " has linked schweinsteiger with a move to juventus .
the report said juve had prepared an offer for a four-year contract and an annual salary of 3.5 million euros should schweinsteiger decide to part ways with munich .
ac milan are reportedly also after the midfielder despite speculation that bayern could be ready to almost double his current salary of an estimated at 3 million euros .

meanwhile , media reports speculate that a real madrid representative was due in munich this week to talk to 24-year-old midfielder schweinsteiger , who can leave on a free transfer in summer and has also been linked with a handful of italian clubs .
podolski and schweinsteiger were the toast of the germany team at the 2006 world cup .

podolski came to munich from cologne in 2006 for 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.6 million -rrb- but has played just 58 games and scored a meagre 12 goals , far less than the 31 he has netted for germany .

poland 's leader lech kaczynski later pointed the finger at russia . at a joint press conference , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and eu foreign policy head javier solana stopped short of pointing the finger of blame at russia , despite moscow and tbilisi trading accusations over the shooting , seemingly aimed at either georgian president mikheil saakashvili or polish president lech kaczynski .
" i do n't know exactly what happened , " de hoop scheffer said .
" it is wrong and certainly not in the spirit of the -lrb- ceasefire -rrb- agreement , " which ended the brief war between georgia and russian in august , he added .
" we are not blaming anyone , but i blame certainly those who started the shooting . "
georgia , however , has blamed russian troops stationed near south ossetia of opening fire as the presidential convoy drove past , a charge russia has denied .
georgia was celebrating the fifth anniversary of its pro-western rose revolution .
" we are in contact with the -lrb- eu -rrb- monitors , " in georgia and " we will see later today " what the observer mission reports on the incident , the eu 's solana said .
polish president points the finger at russia kaczynski on monday blamed russia for firing on the convoy , despite moscow 's denials .
" there is reason to believe that the russians did the shooting , " kaczynski told reporters after returning from his visit to georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski made it clear who he thinks is responsible " i knew in advance that there was a russian post there , one which should n't have been there " under the terms of august 's ceasefire between moscow and tbilisi , kaczynski said .
" i wanted to check on site , and three or four kalashnikov volleys were fired off - though i 'm not saying they were fired in my direction , " he said .
" the russians , of course , are talking about a set-up by the georgians , " he added .
moscow and tbilisi have traded accusations over the incident near the convoy carrying saakashvili and his staunch ally kaczynski sunday , as georgia marked the fifth anniversary of its pro-western " rose revolution . "
georgia accused russian troops near the breakaway region of south ossetia of opening fire as the convoy carrying the two leaders drove by - a claim russia denied .
in warsaw monday , foreign ministers from the visegrad group of states including the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia as well as the three eu baltic states , bulgaria , romania and sweden condemned the incident and called for an investigation .
" the ministers express deepest concern and strongly condemn the incident in georgia on 23 november 2008 when machine-gun fire was opened in immediate vicinity of a motorcade carrying the presidents of georgia and poland , close to south ossetia , georgia , " the minister said in a joint statement .
" the ministers call for proper investigation and clarification of the incident , " it said .
nato chief dispels rumors of naval blockade in somalia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has no plans to set up a naval blockade de hoop scheffer also used the press conference to dispel notions nato was considering a naval blockade to counter pirates in waters off somalia .
" blocking ports is not contemplated by nato , " he told reporters .
he said a blockade did not have the backing of the un security council .
" this is , at the moment , not on the cards . "
an eu mission , dubbed atalanta , is to assume patrol duties off somalia in mid-december from a four-vessel nato fleet that has been protecting food aid shipments to the horn of africa .
military top brass warns of afghanistan failure also monday , nato 's top military commander , general bantz j. craddock , said a stabilization of afghanistan would not happen unless the alliance boosted its troop presence by 40 percent - around 20,000 more soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato forces in afghanistan need a boost , says craddock the united states is set to deploy an extra brigade of up to 5,000 men to afghanistan in 2009 , and " we are looking at how to resource a request from -lrb- nato -rrb- command in afghanistan -rrb- for three more brigades , " craddock said at nato headquarters in belgium .
nato currently has just over 50,000 men in afghanistan under the un-mandated international security assistance force , but they are facing an increasingly bloody challenge from the taliban , especially in the restive east and south of the country .
" where the security is problematic today is about the same places as it was a year ago ... but it is more virulent and it is at a higher tempo than it was last year , " craddock said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 24.11.2008 german politicians demand clarification on kosovo bombing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allegations against the three men are under investigation german politicians want an explanation on the alleged involvement of german secret agents in bombing a european union office in kosovo . three german men remain in prison in kosovo , suspected of being involved in a bomb attack against a european union office in kosovo .
yet many unanswered questions about the incident remain , including whether the men belonged to germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- . max stadler of the free democratic party told the berliner zeitung that he wanted a meeting of the parliamentary committee tasked with overseeing the bnd . " i expect the government and the heads of the bnd to inform the members of parliament , " stadler told the newspaper in an interview published monday , nov .
24 .
" i want to know if the arrestees are bnd employees . " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said monday that the suspects were not registered as intelligence agents . " i have no information on their accreditation .
they could have entered kosovo in a private capacity , " he said , declining to comment further while the investigation is in process . suspects remain jailed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three men have denied the allegations leveled against them , according to media reports lawyers of the men said prosecutors were trying to link their clients to " acts of terrorism , " punishable with up to 20 years in prison . " three german citizens suspected for the explosion ... have to stay one month in detention " the daily express reported sunday according to afp news agency . the kosovar paper added that the germans were " suspected of conducting a criminal act of terrorism . " attorney adem ademi told germany 's dpa news agency in pristina that " some documents " identifying the suspects as bnd agents bnd " were found and presented as evidence , " but he expressed doubts about the documents ' authenticity . asked whether the prosecutor identified the arrested germans as members of the bnd , ademi said : " they are suspected of being members of secret services , but they have n't said explicitly which one . " kosovo and german media reports have claimed the suspects were working for the bnd .
berlin officials have not commented on the allegations . pristina power struggle german terrorism and security expert elmar thevessen told dw-radio that problems within kosovo 's government might be responsible for the detention .
while some within the government support an eu mission that 's due to assume oversight of law-enforcement in kosovo after more than eight years as a united nations protectorate , others reject it . " it looks to me that it is a matter of political intrigue within kosovo , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense at all for the german intelligence service to get involved in a bomb going off in an office of the european union .
as a matter of fact the german government has been known to be one of the biggest supporters of that mission . " thevessen added that bnd agents were also investigating organized crime ties to the kosovo government and that this might be yet another reason why local officials were trying to get rid of them . agents claim innocence police arrested the three germans on wednesday , five days after an explosive device was hurled at the office of the eu 's special representative for the region .
no one was injured in the blast . the three germans said they were inspecting damage done by the bomb blast and were not involved in the attack , according to german media reports . german mass-tabloid bild reported sunday that the bomb attack had been the work of an anti-eu faction of kosovars . anti-eu faction in charge ? the paper said german foreign ministry officials on friday had won an assurance from the kosovo government that there would be no objection to releasing the trio arrested two days earlier . but the faction opposed to european union supervision of the new state won the upper hand on saturday , when the men were committed to custody . kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and pristina , belgrade , the un and eu are currently wrangling over the conditions for the deployment of the eu mission , eulex , comprising 2,000 police , judicial and customs officials . more than 50 states , including the united states and most eu members , have since recognized kosovo . dw staff -lrb- sms / win / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a full 35 percent would support rules allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients end their lives . the anonymous survey of 483 doctors was conducted for the german news magazine der spiegel .
a full 40 percent of doctors indicated they could imagine helping a patient end his or her life , the survey found .
and 16 percent of doctors said they could envision themselves taking the lead role in helping a patient commit suicide .
assisted suicide became a hot topic in germany earlier this year after roger kusch , an ex-senator in hamburg , advised an elderly woman on how to prepare a deadly cocktail of drugs .
in the wake of the woman 's suicide , politicians have called for laws that would make it illegal for anyone to help someone kill themselves or give them advice on how to do so .
violation of medical ethics the doctors taking part in the survey were general practitioners , oncologists , internists , anesthesiologists or palliative medicine practitioners who deal with extremely ill patients in hospitals .
the survey found that 3.3 percent admitted to having helped patients commit suicide on one or more occasions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most doctors have little training in end-of-life care in germany , assisted suicide is illegal , as long as no one physically helps end the person 's life .
but doctor-assisted suicide is widely viewed in germany as violating the code of professional medical conduct and is seen as going against doctors ' legal duties to save lives .
assisted suicide also has also been stigmatized due to the nazi eugenics programs which killed more than 70,000 mentally ill and handicapped people .
hospice organization decries attitude in the survey , 44.5 percent of the doctors said that if they were in the situation of being terminally ill , they would want a colleague to be allowed to help them commit suicide .
nearly one in three said they would want " active " help from a doctor .
germany 's hospice organization said that the results show the need for more ethical training for the medical profession and more money for terminal care .
for the german hospice association , the survey shows " what a bad handle doctors have on ethical and medical questions . "
only four percent of terminally ill patients had access to professional end-of-life care in the last 12 months before their deaths , said eugen brysch , who heads the hospice association .
he said that many doctors can not differentiate between " allowing someone to die " and " killing " someone .

" moscow and tblisi exchanged accusations over an alleged shooting incident sunday , nov .
243 , near the breakaway province of south ossetia .
saakashvili accused russian troops of opening fire on a convoy he was riding in with kaczynski , forcing them to turn back .
" we heard machine-gun volleys about 30 meters -lrb- 100 feet -rrb- from where i was , " the polish pap news agency quoted kaczynski as saying .
automatic gunfire could be heard in shaky television footage but it was unclear where it was coming from .
georgia and russia trade blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president kaczynski backed georgia 's claim of shots fired georgia and russia , which fought a five-day war in august , accused each other of provocation over the incident .
" frankly i did n't expect the russians to open fire .
i thought they clearly saw that this was an official cortege , this was a high delegation , " georgian president mikheil saakashvili said , speaking in english in comments broadcast on bbc world service radio .
russian forces , he said , " were not happy to see us and reacted in this barbaric way . "
" clearly it was intended as a provocation , certainly i would never intend to put the life of the president of poland in danger , that was not my intention but the reality is that you know you are dealing with unpredictable people , " he added .
" aggression continues in georgia , " he said .
" the ceasefire and the european union-brokered agreement are being violated . "
kaczynski was less direct with his words at a news conference : " i appeal from this spot to my friends in the european union to draw the proper conclusions from this event before it is too late ...
i do not regret that trip along that dark road . "
russia : " this is a clear provocation " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , who was accompanying president dmitry medvedev on a trip to the peruvian capital lima for the asia-pacific summit , denied the allegation and accused georgia of deliberate provocation .
" this is a clear provocation , " he told reporters in the peruvian capital lima .
" it is not the first time they are doing so .
they are organizing the provocation and then blame the russian side . "
" when the president invites people to some kind of celebration in tbilisi and then takes a car and takes him to another state , is it not a provocation ?
of course it was , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the checkpoint soldiers were south ossetian , not russian , said one security chief " there was no kind of firing from our positions or south ossetian positions , " he added .
a south ossetian security chief , boris attojev , backed up that claim , telling russian newswire itar-tass that his soldiers stopped the polish-georgian convoy and explained that the border was closed , after which the motorcade left peacefully .
earlier sunday , russian deputy foreign minister grigory karasin had dismissed the claim as " one more instance of wishful thinking on the part of georgia . "
tensions remain high in south ossetia and in another breakaway region , abkhazia , following the august conflict .

for helping to better the world for others like her , mam received the roland berger human dignity award monday . “ myself acquainted with misfortune , i learn to help the unfortunate ” - so said the poet virgil over 2000 years ago .
the saying , however , is one that could have come from the mouth of somaly mam , a cambodian woman who lived through slavery and prostitution as a child and faced every conceivable form of violence .
having escaped that misfortune , mam now uses her horrendous life experience to help fight for the rights of other young women who have been in her situation .
twelve years ago , she founded an ngo for women and children who were used as sex slaves called afesip , or acting for women in distressing situations .
on monday , november 24 , german president horst koehler recognized mam 's work by presenting her with the roland berger human dignity award .
the award , intended for those who work in the field of human rights and financed by the roland berger foundation , is endowed with a million euros .
this is the first year the prize has been awarded .
childhood over at ten born around 38 years ago to parents she would never know , mam was raised by foster parents in the eastern cambodian province of mondolkiri .
at the age of 10 , she moved in with an older man whom she referred to as “ grandpa ” and began her work as a domestic slave to the attentive man .
her childhood ended then ; running the home became her most important duty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mam says cambodian women and children have no say in their lives four or five years later , mam was handed over by “ grandpa ” to a man twelve years her senior , forced to marry to settle an outstanding debt .
that her grandfather had made such a decision about her life , her body and her destiny is something she did n't question .
“ in cambodia , women do n't have the right to say no , ” she said .
“ women and children must sacrifice their entire life to the family . ”
her husband disappeared shortly after their marriage and “ grandpa ” then brought her to a bordello in the cambodian capitol of phnom penh .
“ i thought i owed him something .
he fed me so i thought i had to be thankful and do everything for him . ”
trust fell by the wayside the years following saw mam held as a sex slave .
in those years , violence , malnutrition , abuse and drugs intertwined .
attempts at escape were always hindered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodia 's red light district attracts sex toursists from around the world “ my pimp would catch me and barricade me in a cage with snakes , ” mam recalls .
the memory floods the beautiful woman 's brown eyes with tears when she relates it even today . still , she speaks and writes about her experiences often .
her memoir , “ the road of lost innocence ” was published two years ago .
" i can smile and speak today , but deep in my heart , i do n't feel as normal as you , ” she told guests at the book 's launch party .
“ i do n't know how to love another person .
i do n't know how to trust anyone . ”
mam has , however , learned to trust at least one man : pierre legros , a frenchman she met in cambodia who helped her to flee from the brothel .
she went with him to france , married him and later returned with him to cambodia , where she founded afesip .
the organization and its workers , with support from unicef , have thus far freed a thousand women and children from forced prostitution .
afesip helps them to win back their self-confidence , to re-enter the community , to read and write and later , to train for future careers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literacy is one area afesip focuses on every time mam helps a young girl , she is faced once again with her own fortune and sees the pain and suffering in them reflecting back at her like a mirror .
it 's an immense burden but also an advantage , mam believes .
“ if i had n't had the experiences that i 'd had , i could n't have been able to help these young girls so well . ”
threats an everyday experience the necessity of mam 's work is clearly shown when one looks at the horrific statistics concerning sex slavery in cambodia .
a un report estimates that 50,000 women and young girls are victims of sexual violence every day .
ninety percent of children freed from brothels have tested positive for hiv .
the country ranks as a top destination for sex tourists , which supports a continuation of forced slavery and human trafficking .
still , not everyone agrees with mam 's work .
she 's publicly attacked politicians and businessmen in her homeland for their involvement in corruption and prostitution .
threats of murder and verbal attacks at the “ whistleblower ” are an everyday part of life for mam , as are muggings and kidnappings .
but she wo n't let that stop her .
“ every day , when i see these victims , these women who have been abused , who have so much pain , i know i simply ca n't turn my back on them .
i have to fight with all my power .
i will never give up .
never . ” anja koch -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their breakthrough was made possible by studies in the late 1990s revealing that some people were resistant to hiv / aids , according to a report in new scientist magazine on the berlin hematologists ' discovery .
in these people , the virus can not enter and destroy the white blood cells that it infects and destroys in most other people .
they owed their resistance to a mutation in the gene which makes the molecular " door handle " by which hiv / aids gains access to cells .
called ccr5 , the protein door handle was misshapen in the immune individuals , locking hiv / aids out of their white blood cells , the new scientist report noted .
mutation in about one percent of europeans since the discovery , it has been established that about one percent of europeans have the same mutation , making them resistant to hiv / aids .
to be resistant , they had to inherit the same mutation from both parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckhard thiel and gero huetter announced their discovery earlier this month huetter and thiel made use of this when treating their patient for leukemia , which he had developed in addition to hiv / aids .
to treat the leukemia , the two doctors did the usual thing and sought a bone marrow donor to replenish the patient 's blood supply following chemotherapy to kill the existing , cancerous blood cells .
but the berlin doctors ' new approach was to get a donor who had the double hiv-resistant ccr5 mutation .
this meant that the patient 's replenished blood system would effectively be resistant to hiv / aids , locking out the virus for good .
this is what appears to have happened , according to the new scientist analysis , and huetter declared his patient " functionally cured . "
building on previous attempts several attempts to use bone marrow transplants in hiv / aids treatment have been made since the 1980s .
in one case , a patient with both hiv / aids and lymphoma died of the cancer two months later , but was found to harbor no hiv / aids .
it was not known if something in the transplant had protected him .
and in a famous 1995 case , jeff getty , a prominent san francisco advocate for hiv / aids patients , received bone marrow from a baboon , which is resistant to the human virus .
the new york times reported that he survived for 11 years , but died of hiv / aids and cancer .
the times said the transplant had not protected him but anti-retroviral triple therapy had been invented in time to help .
hotter and thiel have been quick to say that it is far too early to speak of a widespread general cure for hiv / aids .
they stress that their breakthrough is a sound proof of principle , demonstrating that there is hope for treatments that literally lock hiv / aids out in the cold .
but they warn that an all-out cure for the millions of hiv / aids patients worldwide is still a long way off . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" frankly i did n't expect the russians to open fire .
i thought they clearly saw that this was an official cortege , this was a high delegation , " georgian president mikheil saakashvili said , speaking in english in comments broadcast on bbc world service radio .
russian forces , he said , " were not happy to see us and reacted in this barbaric way . "

" this is a clear provocation , " he told reporters in the peruvian capital lima .
" it is not the first time they are doing so .

a south ossetian security chief , boris attojev , backed up that claim , telling russian newswire itar-tass that his soldiers stopped the polish-georgian convoy and explained that the border was closed , after which the motorcade left peacefully .
earlier sunday , russian deputy foreign minister grigory karasin had dismissed the claim as " one more instance of wishful thinking on the part of georgia . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 24.11.2008 olic belter gives hamburg edge over rivals bremen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic , left , helped lead hamburg to victory ivica olic hit an unstoppable shot from outside the area to give sv hamburg a hard-fought 2-1 victory over werder bremen in the northern german derby on sunday , nov .
23 . the croatia striker left goalkeeper tim wiese with no chance when he cut in from the right and hammered a left-foot shot from the corner of the penalty area into the keeper 's top right-hand corner .
wiese had been met by jeers from hamburg fans for a studs-high challenge on olic in last season 's derby at hamburg - and the croatian provided the perfect response .
" i was surprised myself .
that was my best goal yet , but the most important thing was winning the three points , " olic said .
reconciliatory jersey swap olic said there had never been any hard feelings over wiese 's tackle last season , and the two demonstratively swapped shirts inside the stadium at the end of the game .
wiese said he could do nothing about olic 's 74th-minute strike into the angle of post and crossbar .
" i think it could be the goal of the year .
it was a super goal right into the top corner , " he said .
the goal settled a scrappy affair in which neither side was able to create much after paolo guerrero had given hamburg an early lead only for diego to level with a free-kick .
hamburg , who have not been beaten at home since the defeat by bremen late last season , are fifth on 26 points , five behind leaders hoffenheim , while bremen remain ninth on 20 points .
hamburg gained an early advantage when guerrero struck in the sixth minute to rifle the ball in from a narrow angle .
wiese did well to get down low at the near post to keep out a well-struck mladen petric free-kick , but guerrero reacted quickly to rifle the loose ball past wiese .
werder recovered quickly and a naldo free-kick flashed just wide of the post before the visitors were back on level terms in the 24th minute from another set-piece .
bastian reinhardt clipped diego 's heels just outside the area and the brazilian placed the free-kick wide of the wall and keeper frank rost , who got a hand to the ball but was unable to stop the shot .
spectator causes injury bildunterschrift : baumann , right , was injured by a thrown object werder captain frank baumann needed treatment after being struck in the face by an object - believed to be a battery - thrown from the crowd while joining diego and team-mates to celebrate the goal near the corner flag .
" it hit me on just above the left eye-brow .
it was a shock and painful .
there was a little bit of blood but it did n't hinder me , " baumann said .
hamburg sports director dietmar beiersdorfer said : " i want to apologize in the name of sv hamburg .
we do n't know who it was but that sort of thing should n't happen . "
neither side looked capable of fashioning a chance until olic 's goal , which triggered some desperate efforts by bremen to get back in the game .
but it was hamburg who came closest when piotr trochowski was through in stoppage time only for his shot to be saved by wiese .
" i ca n't say the win was deserved but i am very pleased , " hamburg coach martin jol said .
" we started well enough .
the first 10 minutes were good but then werder were the better side even though they did n't have any chances . "
bremen coach thomas schaaf said : " we did n't get as much out of the game as we put into it .
we played well but could n't turn our superiority in midfield into goals . "

wiese did well to get down low at the near post to keep out a well-struck mladen petric free-kick , but guerrero reacted quickly to rifle the loose ball past wiese .
werder recovered quickly and a naldo free-kick flashed just wide of the post before the visitors were back on level terms in the 24th minute from another set-piece .
bastian reinhardt clipped diego 's heels just outside the area and the brazilian placed the free-kick wide of the wall and keeper frank rost , who got a hand to the ball but was unable to stop the shot .

neither side looked capable of fashioning a chance until olic 's goal , which triggered some desperate efforts by bremen to get back in the game .

the first 10 minutes were good but then werder were the better side even though they did n't have any chances . "

a full 35 percent would support rules allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients end their lives . the anonymous survey of 483 doctors was conducted for the german news magazine der spiegel .
a full 40 percent of doctors indicated they could imagine helping a patient end his or her life , the survey found .
and 16 percent of doctors said they could envision themselves taking the lead role in helping a patient commit suicide .
assisted suicide became a hot topic in germany earlier this year after roger kusch , an ex-senator in hamburg , advised an elderly woman on how to prepare a deadly cocktail of drugs .
in the wake of the woman 's suicide , politicians have called for laws that would make it illegal for anyone to help someone kill themselves or give them advice on how to do so .
violation of medical ethics the doctors taking part in the survey were general practitioners , oncologists , internists , anesthesiologists or palliative medicine practitioners who deal with extremely ill patients in hospitals .
the survey found that 3.3 percent admitted to having helped patients commit suicide on one or more occasions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most doctors have little training in end-of-life care in germany , assisted suicide is illegal , as long as no one physically helps end the person 's life .
but doctor-assisted suicide is widely viewed in germany as violating the code of professional medical conduct and is seen as going against doctors ' legal duties to save lives .
assisted suicide also has also been stigmatized due to the nazi eugenics programs which killed more than 70,000 mentally ill and handicapped people .
hospice organization decries attitude in the survey , 44.5 percent of the doctors said that if they were in the situation of being terminally ill , they would want a colleague to be allowed to help them commit suicide .
nearly one in three said they would want " active " help from a doctor .
germany 's hospice organization said that the results show the need for more ethical training for the medical profession and more money for terminal care .
for the german hospice association , the survey shows " what a bad handle doctors have on ethical and medical questions . "
only four percent of terminally ill patients had access to professional end-of-life care in the last 12 months before their deaths , said eugen brysch , who heads the hospice association .
he said that many doctors can not differentiate between " allowing someone to die " and " killing " someone .
the hospice organization wants to see the german government , as well as states and medical groups , invest 30 million euros -lrb- $ 38 million -rrb- each year in ethics training . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 against rushing into adopting a europe-wide economic stimulus package and ruled out reducing value-added tax in germany after talks with french president sarkozy . speaking after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , merkel said the seriousness of the current economic downturn called for a timely and measured approach to the situation .
" the risk that we are running today , taking into account information that is not always easy -lrb- to interpret -rrb- , is that we mistake haste for action , " she said .
vat cuts ' not right ' for germany both sarkozy and merkel also said their countries would not undertake a uk-style slashing of value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to stimulate spending as a way of fighting the financial crisis .
" a lower vat is not the right solution for france and germany , " merkel said .
" we are both agreed . "
sarkozy said lowering vat may be a viable option for other countries , such as britain , but agreed that it was a wrong fit for paris and berlin .
" when we lower the vat , what does that bring ?
only lower prices , " sarkozy said .
" we think other measures , such as emphasizing innovation and research , would be more effective for our economies . "
however , in his successful campaign for the 2007 presidential election , sarkozy vowed that he would convince the eu to allow france to lower its vat , particularly for french restaurants , where the tax is 19.6 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vat cuts would just reduce profits for businesses like restaurants but germany has repeatedly vetoed the proposal in brussels , claiming that lowering the vat in france to the proposed 5.5 percent would give french restaurants an unfair competitive advantage over german eateries , where vat is 19 percent .

sarkozy was also to use the discussion as an opportunity to persuade merkel of the merits of a europe-wide economic stimulus package to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany has steadfastly rejected contributing a larger slice of its profits for europe .
the french president said nonetheless there was " much more agreement than disagreement " between the two sides on how to re-launch their economies .
" we acted together on the crisis .
we made the same analysis , " sarkozy said .
heat is on germany germany , as europe 's largest and the world 's third largest economy , has been under pressure in recent weeks to do more to help kick-start the european economy .
merkel 's government has already pledged 1.3 percent of gdp to energize the german economy , but brussels is to request a further 1 percent of gdp to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany 's contribution would translate to around 25 billion euros .
the stimulus package plan is to be unveiled by the european commission on wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .
but berlin has insisted it was already doing enough and need n't contribute further funds to reinvigorate europe 's economy .

24 against rushing into adopting a europe-wide economic stimulus package and ruled out reducing value-added tax in germany after talks with french president sarkozy . speaking after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , merkel said the seriousness of the current economic downturn called for a timely and measured approach to the situation .
" the risk that we are running today , taking into account information that is not always easy -lrb- to interpret -rrb- , is that we mistake haste for action , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 24.11.2008 survey : many german doctors support assisted suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethical concerns keep most doctors from assisting with suicides a new survey shows that a surprising number of german doctors have no moral qualms about assisted suicide .
a full 35 percent would support rules allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients end their lives . the anonymous survey of 483 doctors was conducted for the german news magazine der spiegel .
a full 40 percent of doctors indicated they could imagine helping a patient end his or her life , the survey found .
and 16 percent of doctors said they could envision themselves taking the lead role in helping a patient commit suicide .
assisted suicide became a hot topic in germany earlier this year after roger kusch , an ex-senator in hamburg , advised an elderly woman on how to prepare a deadly cocktail of drugs .
in the wake of the woman 's suicide , politicians have called for laws that would make it illegal for anyone to help someone kill themselves or give them advice on how to do so .
violation of medical ethics the doctors taking part in the survey were general practitioners , oncologists , internists , anesthesiologists or palliative medicine practitioners who deal with extremely ill patients in hospitals .
the survey found that 3.3 percent admitted to having helped patients commit suicide on one or more occasions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most doctors have little training in end-of-life care in germany , assisted suicide is illegal , as long as no one physically helps end the person 's life .
but doctor-assisted suicide is widely viewed in germany as violating the code of professional medical conduct and is seen as going against doctors ' legal duties to save lives .
assisted suicide also has also been stigmatized due to the nazi eugenics programs which killed more than 70,000 mentally ill and handicapped people .
hospice organization decries attitude in the survey , 44.5 percent of the doctors said that if they were in the situation of being terminally ill , they would want a colleague to be allowed to help them commit suicide .
nearly one in three said they would want " active " help from a doctor .
germany 's hospice organization said that the results show the need for more ethical training for the medical profession and more money for terminal care .
for the german hospice association , the survey shows " what a bad handle doctors have on ethical and medical questions . "

" moscow and tblisi exchanged accusations over an alleged shooting incident sunday , nov .
243 , near the breakaway province of south ossetia .
saakashvili accused russian troops of opening fire on a convoy he was riding in with kaczynski , forcing them to turn back .
" we heard machine-gun volleys about 30 meters -lrb- 100 feet -rrb- from where i was , " the polish pap news agency quoted kaczynski as saying .
automatic gunfire could be heard in shaky television footage but it was unclear where it was coming from .
georgia and russia trade blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president kaczynski backed georgia 's claim of shots fired georgia and russia , which fought a five-day war in august , accused each other of provocation over the incident .
" frankly i did n't expect the russians to open fire .
i thought they clearly saw that this was an official cortege , this was a high delegation , " georgian president mikheil saakashvili said , speaking in english in comments broadcast on bbc world service radio .
russian forces , he said , " were not happy to see us and reacted in this barbaric way . "
" clearly it was intended as a provocation , certainly i would never intend to put the life of the president of poland in danger , that was not my intention but the reality is that you know you are dealing with unpredictable people , " he added .
" aggression continues in georgia , " he said .
" the ceasefire and the european union-brokered agreement are being violated . "
kaczynski was less direct with his words at a news conference : " i appeal from this spot to my friends in the european union to draw the proper conclusions from this event before it is too late ...
i do not regret that trip along that dark road . "
russia : " this is a clear provocation " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , who was accompanying president dmitry medvedev on a trip to the peruvian capital lima for the asia-pacific summit , denied the allegation and accused georgia of deliberate provocation .
" this is a clear provocation , " he told reporters in the peruvian capital lima .
" it is not the first time they are doing so .
they are organizing the provocation and then blame the russian side . "
" when the president invites people to some kind of celebration in tbilisi and then takes a car and takes him to another state , is it not a provocation ?
of course it was , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the checkpoint soldiers were south ossetian , not russian , said one security chief " there was no kind of firing from our positions or south ossetian positions , " he added .
a south ossetian security chief , boris attojev , backed up that claim , telling russian newswire itar-tass that his soldiers stopped the polish-georgian convoy and explained that the border was closed , after which the motorcade left peacefully .
earlier sunday , russian deputy foreign minister grigory karasin had dismissed the claim as " one more instance of wishful thinking on the part of georgia . "
tensions remain high in south ossetia and in another breakaway region , abkhazia , following the august conflict .
russian forces had pushed into georgia - whose candidacy for nato membership is up for review in december - on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the pro-moscow breakaway region of south ossetia .
russian forces have pulled back from buffer zones into south ossetian territory and a 225-strong eu observation mission is monitoring a fragile ceasefire . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , media reports speculate that a real madrid representative was due in munich this week to talk to 24-year-old midfielder schweinsteiger , who can leave on a free transfer in summer and has also been linked with a handful of italian clubs .
podolski and schweinsteiger were the toast of the germany team at the 2006 world cup .
despite their age they have already won 60 and 62 national team caps , respectively .
poldi 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has spent more time on bayern 's bench than on the park but while schweinsteiger has been a regular starter at bayern under new coach juergen klinsmann , striker podolski has been unable to secure a regular first-team birth .
podolski came to munich from cologne in 2006 for 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.6 million -rrb- but has played just 58 games and scored a meagre 12 goals , far less than the 31 he has netted for germany .
furthermore , he has been made to stand in the shadow of italian international luca toni and fellow germany national team representative miroslav klose .
" i have told those responsible that i want to leave -lrb- the club -rrb- in winter , " podolski was quoted as telling the " bild " daily .
podolski has been frequently linked with a return to his home club cologne , but bayern general manager uli hoeness reiterated on the weekend that no player would leave during the winter break .
schweini draws italian , spanish eyes bayern have started talks with schweinsteiger about a contract renewal beyond 2009 but appear to face more and more interest from rivals clubs abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger has drawn much interest from abroad sports magazine " kicker " reported that real 's technical director miguel angel portugal was scheduled to meet the player and his representatives this week .
meanwhile , italy 's " la gazzetta dello sport " has linked schweinsteiger with a move to juventus .
the report said juve had prepared an offer for a four-year contract and an annual salary of 3.5 million euros should schweinsteiger decide to part ways with munich .
ac milan are reportedly also after the midfielder despite speculation that bayern could be ready to almost double his current salary of an estimated at 3 million euros .
schweinsteiger has stated he would talk with bayern first but that he could also imagine playing in another country . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their breakthrough was made possible by studies in the late 1990s revealing that some people were resistant to hiv / aids , according to a report in new scientist magazine on the berlin hematologists ' discovery .
in these people , the virus can not enter and destroy the white blood cells that it infects and destroys in most other people .
they owed their resistance to a mutation in the gene which makes the molecular " door handle " by which hiv / aids gains access to cells .
called ccr5 , the protein door handle was misshapen in the immune individuals , locking hiv / aids out of their white blood cells , the new scientist report noted .
mutation in about one percent of europeans since the discovery , it has been established that about one percent of europeans have the same mutation , making them resistant to hiv / aids .
to be resistant , they had to inherit the same mutation from both parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckhard thiel and gero huetter announced their discovery earlier this month huetter and thiel made use of this when treating their patient for leukemia , which he had developed in addition to hiv / aids .
to treat the leukemia , the two doctors did the usual thing and sought a bone marrow donor to replenish the patient 's blood supply following chemotherapy to kill the existing , cancerous blood cells .
but the berlin doctors ' new approach was to get a donor who had the double hiv-resistant ccr5 mutation .
this meant that the patient 's replenished blood system would effectively be resistant to hiv / aids , locking out the virus for good .
this is what appears to have happened , according to the new scientist analysis , and huetter declared his patient " functionally cured . "
building on previous attempts several attempts to use bone marrow transplants in hiv / aids treatment have been made since the 1980s .
in one case , a patient with both hiv / aids and lymphoma died of the cancer two months later , but was found to harbor no hiv / aids .
it was not known if something in the transplant had protected him .
and in a famous 1995 case , jeff getty , a prominent san francisco advocate for hiv / aids patients , received bone marrow from a baboon , which is resistant to the human virus .
the new york times reported that he survived for 11 years , but died of hiv / aids and cancer .
the times said the transplant had not protected him but anti-retroviral triple therapy had been invented in time to help .
hotter and thiel have been quick to say that it is far too early to speak of a widespread general cure for hiv / aids .
they stress that their breakthrough is a sound proof of principle , demonstrating that there is hope for treatments that literally lock hiv / aids out in the cold .
but they warn that an all-out cure for the millions of hiv / aids patients worldwide is still a long way off . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for helping to better the world for others like her , mam received the roland berger human dignity award monday . “ myself acquainted with misfortune , i learn to help the unfortunate ” - so said the poet virgil over 2000 years ago .
the saying , however , is one that could have come from the mouth of somaly mam , a cambodian woman who lived through slavery and prostitution as a child and faced every conceivable form of violence .
having escaped that misfortune , mam now uses her horrendous life experience to help fight for the rights of other young women who have been in her situation .
twelve years ago , she founded an ngo for women and children who were used as sex slaves called afesip , or acting for women in distressing situations .
on monday , november 24 , german president horst koehler recognized mam 's work by presenting her with the roland berger human dignity award .
the award , intended for those who work in the field of human rights and financed by the roland berger foundation , is endowed with a million euros .
this is the first year the prize has been awarded .
childhood over at ten born around 38 years ago to parents she would never know , mam was raised by foster parents in the eastern cambodian province of mondolkiri .
at the age of 10 , she moved in with an older man whom she referred to as “ grandpa ” and began her work as a domestic slave to the attentive man .
her childhood ended then ; running the home became her most important duty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mam says cambodian women and children have no say in their lives four or five years later , mam was handed over by “ grandpa ” to a man twelve years her senior , forced to marry to settle an outstanding debt .
that her grandfather had made such a decision about her life , her body and her destiny is something she did n't question .
“ in cambodia , women do n't have the right to say no , ” she said .
“ women and children must sacrifice their entire life to the family . ”
her husband disappeared shortly after their marriage and “ grandpa ” then brought her to a bordello in the cambodian capitol of phnom penh .
“ i thought i owed him something .
he fed me so i thought i had to be thankful and do everything for him . ”
trust fell by the wayside the years following saw mam held as a sex slave .
in those years , violence , malnutrition , abuse and drugs intertwined .
attempts at escape were always hindered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodia 's red light district attracts sex toursists from around the world “ my pimp would catch me and barricade me in a cage with snakes , ” mam recalls .
the memory floods the beautiful woman 's brown eyes with tears when she relates it even today . still , she speaks and writes about her experiences often .
her memoir , “ the road of lost innocence ” was published two years ago .
" i can smile and speak today , but deep in my heart , i do n't feel as normal as you , ” she told guests at the book 's launch party .
“ i do n't know how to love another person .
i do n't know how to trust anyone . ”
mam has , however , learned to trust at least one man : pierre legros , a frenchman she met in cambodia who helped her to flee from the brothel .
she went with him to france , married him and later returned with him to cambodia , where she founded afesip .
the organization and its workers , with support from unicef , have thus far freed a thousand women and children from forced prostitution .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodia 's red light district attracts sex toursists from around the world “ my pimp would catch me and barricade me in a cage with snakes , ” mam recalls .
the memory floods the beautiful woman 's brown eyes with tears when she relates it even today . still , she speaks and writes about her experiences often .
her memoir , “ the road of lost innocence ” was published two years ago .
" i can smile and speak today , but deep in my heart , i do n't feel as normal as you , ” she told guests at the book 's launch party .
“ i do n't know how to love another person .
i do n't know how to trust anyone . ”
mam has , however , learned to trust at least one man : pierre legros , a frenchman she met in cambodia who helped her to flee from the brothel .
she went with him to france , married him and later returned with him to cambodia , where she founded afesip .
the organization and its workers , with support from unicef , have thus far freed a thousand women and children from forced prostitution .
afesip helps them to win back their self-confidence , to re-enter the community , to read and write and later , to train for future careers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literacy is one area afesip focuses on every time mam helps a young girl , she is faced once again with her own fortune and sees the pain and suffering in them reflecting back at her like a mirror .
it 's an immense burden but also an advantage , mam believes .
“ if i had n't had the experiences that i 'd had , i could n't have been able to help these young girls so well . ”
threats an everyday experience the necessity of mam 's work is clearly shown when one looks at the horrific statistics concerning sex slavery in cambodia .
a un report estimates that 50,000 women and young girls are victims of sexual violence every day .
ninety percent of children freed from brothels have tested positive for hiv .
the country ranks as a top destination for sex tourists , which supports a continuation of forced slavery and human trafficking .
still , not everyone agrees with mam 's work .
she 's publicly attacked politicians and businessmen in her homeland for their involvement in corruption and prostitution .
threats of murder and verbal attacks at the “ whistleblower ” are an everyday part of life for mam , as are muggings and kidnappings .
but she wo n't let that stop her .
“ every day , when i see these victims , these women who have been abused , who have so much pain , i know i simply ca n't turn my back on them .
i have to fight with all my power .
i will never give up .
never . ” anja koch -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , media reports speculate that a real madrid representative was due in munich this week to talk to 24-year-old midfielder schweinsteiger , who can leave on a free transfer in summer and has also been linked with a handful of italian clubs .
podolski and schweinsteiger were the toast of the germany team at the 2006 world cup .
despite their age they have already won 60 and 62 national team caps , respectively .
poldi 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has spent more time on bayern 's bench than on the park but while schweinsteiger has been a regular starter at bayern under new coach juergen klinsmann , striker podolski has been unable to secure a regular first-team birth .
podolski came to munich from cologne in 2006 for 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.6 million -rrb- but has played just 58 games and scored a meagre 12 goals , far less than the 31 he has netted for germany .
furthermore , he has been made to stand in the shadow of italian international luca toni and fellow germany national team representative miroslav klose .
" i have told those responsible that i want to leave -lrb- the club -rrb- in winter , " podolski was quoted as telling the " bild " daily .
podolski has been frequently linked with a return to his home club cologne , but bayern general manager uli hoeness reiterated on the weekend that no player would leave during the winter break .
schweini draws italian , spanish eyes bayern have started talks with schweinsteiger about a contract renewal beyond 2009 but appear to face more and more interest from rivals clubs abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger has drawn much interest from abroad sports magazine " kicker " reported that real 's technical director miguel angel portugal was scheduled to meet the player and his representatives this week .
meanwhile , italy 's " la gazzetta dello sport " has linked schweinsteiger with a move to juventus .
the report said juve had prepared an offer for a four-year contract and an annual salary of 3.5 million euros should schweinsteiger decide to part ways with munich .
ac milan are reportedly also after the midfielder despite speculation that bayern could be ready to almost double his current salary of an estimated at 3 million euros .
schweinsteiger has stated he would talk with bayern first but that he could also imagine playing in another country . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 . the croatia striker left goalkeeper tim wiese with no chance when he cut in from the right and hammered a left-foot shot from the corner of the penalty area into the keeper 's top right-hand corner .
wiese had been met by jeers from hamburg fans for a studs-high challenge on olic in last season 's derby at hamburg - and the croatian provided the perfect response .
" i was surprised myself .
that was my best goal yet , but the most important thing was winning the three points , " olic said .
reconciliatory jersey swap olic said there had never been any hard feelings over wiese 's tackle last season , and the two demonstratively swapped shirts inside the stadium at the end of the game .
wiese said he could do nothing about olic 's 74th-minute strike into the angle of post and crossbar .
" i think it could be the goal of the year .
it was a super goal right into the top corner , " he said .
the goal settled a scrappy affair in which neither side was able to create much after paolo guerrero had given hamburg an early lead only for diego to level with a free-kick .
hamburg , who have not been beaten at home since the defeat by bremen late last season , are fifth on 26 points , five behind leaders hoffenheim , while bremen remain ninth on 20 points .
hamburg gained an early advantage when guerrero struck in the sixth minute to rifle the ball in from a narrow angle .
wiese did well to get down low at the near post to keep out a well-struck mladen petric free-kick , but guerrero reacted quickly to rifle the loose ball past wiese .
werder recovered quickly and a naldo free-kick flashed just wide of the post before the visitors were back on level terms in the 24th minute from another set-piece .
bastian reinhardt clipped diego 's heels just outside the area and the brazilian placed the free-kick wide of the wall and keeper frank rost , who got a hand to the ball but was unable to stop the shot .
spectator causes injury bildunterschrift : baumann , right , was injured by a thrown object werder captain frank baumann needed treatment after being struck in the face by an object - believed to be a battery - thrown from the crowd while joining diego and team-mates to celebrate the goal near the corner flag .
" it hit me on just above the left eye-brow .
it was a shock and painful .
there was a little bit of blood but it did n't hinder me , " baumann said .
hamburg sports director dietmar beiersdorfer said : " i want to apologize in the name of sv hamburg .
we do n't know who it was but that sort of thing should n't happen . "
neither side looked capable of fashioning a chance until olic 's goal , which triggered some desperate efforts by bremen to get back in the game .
but it was hamburg who came closest when piotr trochowski was through in stoppage time only for his shot to be saved by wiese .
" i ca n't say the win was deserved but i am very pleased , " hamburg coach martin jol said .
" we started well enough .
the first 10 minutes were good but then werder were the better side even though they did n't have any chances . "

23 . the croatia striker left goalkeeper tim wiese with no chance when he cut in from the right and hammered a left-foot shot from the corner of the penalty area into the keeper 's top right-hand corner .
wiese had been met by jeers from hamburg fans for a studs-high challenge on olic in last season 's derby at hamburg - and the croatian provided the perfect response .
" i was surprised myself .
that was my best goal yet , but the most important thing was winning the three points , " olic said .
reconciliatory jersey swap olic said there had never been any hard feelings over wiese 's tackle last season , and the two demonstratively swapped shirts inside the stadium at the end of the game .
wiese said he could do nothing about olic 's 74th-minute strike into the angle of post and crossbar .
" i think it could be the goal of the year .
it was a super goal right into the top corner , " he said .
the goal settled a scrappy affair in which neither side was able to create much after paolo guerrero had given hamburg an early lead only for diego to level with a free-kick .
hamburg , who have not been beaten at home since the defeat by bremen late last season , are fifth on 26 points , five behind leaders hoffenheim , while bremen remain ninth on 20 points .
hamburg gained an early advantage when guerrero struck in the sixth minute to rifle the ball in from a narrow angle .
wiese did well to get down low at the near post to keep out a well-struck mladen petric free-kick , but guerrero reacted quickly to rifle the loose ball past wiese .
werder recovered quickly and a naldo free-kick flashed just wide of the post before the visitors were back on level terms in the 24th minute from another set-piece .
bastian reinhardt clipped diego 's heels just outside the area and the brazilian placed the free-kick wide of the wall and keeper frank rost , who got a hand to the ball but was unable to stop the shot .
spectator causes injury bildunterschrift : baumann , right , was injured by a thrown object werder captain frank baumann needed treatment after being struck in the face by an object - believed to be a battery - thrown from the crowd while joining diego and team-mates to celebrate the goal near the corner flag .
" it hit me on just above the left eye-brow .
it was a shock and painful .
there was a little bit of blood but it did n't hinder me , " baumann said .
hamburg sports director dietmar beiersdorfer said : " i want to apologize in the name of sv hamburg .
we do n't know who it was but that sort of thing should n't happen . "
neither side looked capable of fashioning a chance until olic 's goal , which triggered some desperate efforts by bremen to get back in the game .
but it was hamburg who came closest when piotr trochowski was through in stoppage time only for his shot to be saved by wiese .
" i ca n't say the win was deserved but i am very pleased , " hamburg coach martin jol said .
" we started well enough .
the first 10 minutes were good but then werder were the better side even though they did n't have any chances . "
bremen coach thomas schaaf said : " we did n't get as much out of the game as we put into it .
we played well but could n't turn our superiority in midfield into goals . "

" moscow and tblisi exchanged accusations over an alleged shooting incident sunday , nov .
243 , near the breakaway province of south ossetia .
saakashvili accused russian troops of opening fire on a convoy he was riding in with kaczynski , forcing them to turn back .
" we heard machine-gun volleys about 30 meters -lrb- 100 feet -rrb- from where i was , " the polish pap news agency quoted kaczynski as saying .
automatic gunfire could be heard in shaky television footage but it was unclear where it was coming from .
georgia and russia trade blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president kaczynski backed georgia 's claim of shots fired georgia and russia , which fought a five-day war in august , accused each other of provocation over the incident .
" frankly i did n't expect the russians to open fire .
i thought they clearly saw that this was an official cortege , this was a high delegation , " georgian president mikheil saakashvili said , speaking in english in comments broadcast on bbc world service radio .
russian forces , he said , " were not happy to see us and reacted in this barbaric way . "
" clearly it was intended as a provocation , certainly i would never intend to put the life of the president of poland in danger , that was not my intention but the reality is that you know you are dealing with unpredictable people , " he added .
" aggression continues in georgia , " he said .
" the ceasefire and the european union-brokered agreement are being violated . "
kaczynski was less direct with his words at a news conference : " i appeal from this spot to my friends in the european union to draw the proper conclusions from this event before it is too late ...
i do not regret that trip along that dark road . "
russia : " this is a clear provocation " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , who was accompanying president dmitry medvedev on a trip to the peruvian capital lima for the asia-pacific summit , denied the allegation and accused georgia of deliberate provocation .
" this is a clear provocation , " he told reporters in the peruvian capital lima .
" it is not the first time they are doing so .
they are organizing the provocation and then blame the russian side . "
" when the president invites people to some kind of celebration in tbilisi and then takes a car and takes him to another state , is it not a provocation ?
of course it was , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the checkpoint soldiers were south ossetian , not russian , said one security chief " there was no kind of firing from our positions or south ossetian positions , " he added .
a south ossetian security chief , boris attojev , backed up that claim , telling russian newswire itar-tass that his soldiers stopped the polish-georgian convoy and explained that the border was closed , after which the motorcade left peacefully .
earlier sunday , russian deputy foreign minister grigory karasin had dismissed the claim as " one more instance of wishful thinking on the part of georgia . "
tensions remain high in south ossetia and in another breakaway region , abkhazia , following the august conflict .
russian forces had pushed into georgia - whose candidacy for nato membership is up for review in december - on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the pro-moscow breakaway region of south ossetia .
russian forces have pulled back from buffer zones into south ossetian territory and a 225-strong eu observation mission is monitoring a fragile ceasefire . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" moscow and tblisi exchanged accusations over an alleged shooting incident sunday , nov .
243 , near the breakaway province of south ossetia .
saakashvili accused russian troops of opening fire on a convoy he was riding in with kaczynski , forcing them to turn back .
" we heard machine-gun volleys about 30 meters -lrb- 100 feet -rrb- from where i was , " the polish pap news agency quoted kaczynski as saying .
automatic gunfire could be heard in shaky television footage but it was unclear where it was coming from .
georgia and russia trade blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president kaczynski backed georgia 's claim of shots fired georgia and russia , which fought a five-day war in august , accused each other of provocation over the incident .
" frankly i did n't expect the russians to open fire .
i thought they clearly saw that this was an official cortege , this was a high delegation , " georgian president mikheil saakashvili said , speaking in english in comments broadcast on bbc world service radio .
russian forces , he said , " were not happy to see us and reacted in this barbaric way . "
" clearly it was intended as a provocation , certainly i would never intend to put the life of the president of poland in danger , that was not my intention but the reality is that you know you are dealing with unpredictable people , " he added .
" aggression continues in georgia , " he said .
" the ceasefire and the european union-brokered agreement are being violated . "
kaczynski was less direct with his words at a news conference : " i appeal from this spot to my friends in the european union to draw the proper conclusions from this event before it is too late ...
i do not regret that trip along that dark road . "
russia : " this is a clear provocation " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , who was accompanying president dmitry medvedev on a trip to the peruvian capital lima for the asia-pacific summit , denied the allegation and accused georgia of deliberate provocation .
" this is a clear provocation , " he told reporters in the peruvian capital lima .
" it is not the first time they are doing so .
they are organizing the provocation and then blame the russian side . "
" when the president invites people to some kind of celebration in tbilisi and then takes a car and takes him to another state , is it not a provocation ?
of course it was , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the checkpoint soldiers were south ossetian , not russian , said one security chief " there was no kind of firing from our positions or south ossetian positions , " he added .
a south ossetian security chief , boris attojev , backed up that claim , telling russian newswire itar-tass that his soldiers stopped the polish-georgian convoy and explained that the border was closed , after which the motorcade left peacefully .
earlier sunday , russian deputy foreign minister grigory karasin had dismissed the claim as " one more instance of wishful thinking on the part of georgia . "
tensions remain high in south ossetia and in another breakaway region , abkhazia , following the august conflict .
russian forces had pushed into georgia - whose candidacy for nato membership is up for review in december - on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the pro-moscow breakaway region of south ossetia .
russian forces have pulled back from buffer zones into south ossetian territory and a 225-strong eu observation mission is monitoring a fragile ceasefire . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

243 , near the breakaway province of south ossetia .
saakashvili accused russian troops of opening fire on a convoy he was riding in with kaczynski , forcing them to turn back .
" we heard machine-gun volleys about 30 meters -lrb- 100 feet -rrb- from where i was , " the polish pap news agency quoted kaczynski as saying .
automatic gunfire could be heard in shaky television footage but it was unclear where it was coming from .
georgia and russia trade blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president kaczynski backed georgia 's claim of shots fired georgia and russia , which fought a five-day war in august , accused each other of provocation over the incident .
" frankly i did n't expect the russians to open fire .
i thought they clearly saw that this was an official cortege , this was a high delegation , " georgian president mikheil saakashvili said , speaking in english in comments broadcast on bbc world service radio .
russian forces , he said , " were not happy to see us and reacted in this barbaric way . "
" clearly it was intended as a provocation , certainly i would never intend to put the life of the president of poland in danger , that was not my intention but the reality is that you know you are dealing with unpredictable people , " he added .
" aggression continues in georgia , " he said .
" the ceasefire and the european union-brokered agreement are being violated . "
kaczynski was less direct with his words at a news conference : " i appeal from this spot to my friends in the european union to draw the proper conclusions from this event before it is too late ...
i do not regret that trip along that dark road . "
russia : " this is a clear provocation " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , who was accompanying president dmitry medvedev on a trip to the peruvian capital lima for the asia-pacific summit , denied the allegation and accused georgia of deliberate provocation .
" this is a clear provocation , " he told reporters in the peruvian capital lima .
" it is not the first time they are doing so .
they are organizing the provocation and then blame the russian side . "
" when the president invites people to some kind of celebration in tbilisi and then takes a car and takes him to another state , is it not a provocation ?
of course it was , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the checkpoint soldiers were south ossetian , not russian , said one security chief " there was no kind of firing from our positions or south ossetian positions , " he added .
a south ossetian security chief , boris attojev , backed up that claim , telling russian newswire itar-tass that his soldiers stopped the polish-georgian convoy and explained that the border was closed , after which the motorcade left peacefully .
earlier sunday , russian deputy foreign minister grigory karasin had dismissed the claim as " one more instance of wishful thinking on the part of georgia . "
tensions remain high in south ossetia and in another breakaway region , abkhazia , following the august conflict .
russian forces had pushed into georgia - whose candidacy for nato membership is up for review in december - on aug .
8 to repel a georgian military attempt to retake the pro-moscow breakaway region of south ossetia .
russian forces have pulled back from buffer zones into south ossetian territory and a 225-strong eu observation mission is monitoring a fragile ceasefire . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , media reports speculate that a real madrid representative was due in munich this week to talk to 24-year-old midfielder schweinsteiger , who can leave on a free transfer in summer and has also been linked with a handful of italian clubs .
podolski and schweinsteiger were the toast of the germany team at the 2006 world cup .

" i have told those responsible that i want to leave -lrb- the club -rrb- in winter , " podolski was quoted as telling the " bild " daily .
podolski has been frequently linked with a return to his home club cologne , but bayern general manager uli hoeness reiterated on the weekend that no player would leave during the winter break .

meanwhile , media reports speculate that a real madrid representative was due in munich this week to talk to 24-year-old midfielder schweinsteiger , who can leave on a free transfer in summer and has also been linked with a handful of italian clubs .
podolski and schweinsteiger were the toast of the germany team at the 2006 world cup .
despite their age they have already won 60 and 62 national team caps , respectively .
poldi 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has spent more time on bayern 's bench than on the park but while schweinsteiger has been a regular starter at bayern under new coach juergen klinsmann , striker podolski has been unable to secure a regular first-team birth .
podolski came to munich from cologne in 2006 for 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.6 million -rrb- but has played just 58 games and scored a meagre 12 goals , far less than the 31 he has netted for germany .
furthermore , he has been made to stand in the shadow of italian international luca toni and fellow germany national team representative miroslav klose .
" i have told those responsible that i want to leave -lrb- the club -rrb- in winter , " podolski was quoted as telling the " bild " daily .
podolski has been frequently linked with a return to his home club cologne , but bayern general manager uli hoeness reiterated on the weekend that no player would leave during the winter break .
schweini draws italian , spanish eyes bayern have started talks with schweinsteiger about a contract renewal beyond 2009 but appear to face more and more interest from rivals clubs abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger has drawn much interest from abroad sports magazine " kicker " reported that real 's technical director miguel angel portugal was scheduled to meet the player and his representatives this week .
meanwhile , italy 's " la gazzetta dello sport " has linked schweinsteiger with a move to juventus .
the report said juve had prepared an offer for a four-year contract and an annual salary of 3.5 million euros should schweinsteiger decide to part ways with munich .
ac milan are reportedly also after the midfielder despite speculation that bayern could be ready to almost double his current salary of an estimated at 3 million euros .
schweinsteiger has stated he would talk with bayern first but that he could also imagine playing in another country . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

medvedev holds out for obama u-turn " dialogue is possible , a change of position is possible , " medvedev was quoted by news agency interfax as saying in lima , where current us president george w bush was also in attendance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 24.11.2008 survey : many german doctors support assisted suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethical concerns keep most doctors from assisting with suicides a new survey shows that a surprising number of german doctors have no moral qualms about assisted suicide .
a full 35 percent would support rules allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients end their lives . the anonymous survey of 483 doctors was conducted for the german news magazine der spiegel .
a full 40 percent of doctors indicated they could imagine helping a patient end his or her life , the survey found .
and 16 percent of doctors said they could envision themselves taking the lead role in helping a patient commit suicide .
assisted suicide became a hot topic in germany earlier this year after roger kusch , an ex-senator in hamburg , advised an elderly woman on how to prepare a deadly cocktail of drugs .
in the wake of the woman 's suicide , politicians have called for laws that would make it illegal for anyone to help someone kill themselves or give them advice on how to do so .
violation of medical ethics the doctors taking part in the survey were general practitioners , oncologists , internists , anesthesiologists or palliative medicine practitioners who deal with extremely ill patients in hospitals .
the survey found that 3.3 percent admitted to having helped patients commit suicide on one or more occasions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most doctors have little training in end-of-life care in germany , assisted suicide is illegal , as long as no one physically helps end the person 's life .
but doctor-assisted suicide is widely viewed in germany as violating the code of professional medical conduct and is seen as going against doctors ' legal duties to save lives .
assisted suicide also has also been stigmatized due to the nazi eugenics programs which killed more than 70,000 mentally ill and handicapped people .
hospice organization decries attitude in the survey , 44.5 percent of the doctors said that if they were in the situation of being terminally ill , they would want a colleague to be allowed to help them commit suicide .
nearly one in three said they would want " active " help from a doctor .
germany 's hospice organization said that the results show the need for more ethical training for the medical profession and more money for terminal care .
for the german hospice association , the survey shows " what a bad handle doctors have on ethical and medical questions . "
only four percent of terminally ill patients had access to professional end-of-life care in the last 12 months before their deaths , said eugen brysch , who heads the hospice association .
he said that many doctors can not differentiate between " allowing someone to die " and " killing " someone .
the hospice organization wants to see the german government , as well as states and medical groups , invest 30 million euros -lrb- $ 38 million -rrb- each year in ethics training . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a full 35 percent would support rules allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients end their lives . the anonymous survey of 483 doctors was conducted for the german news magazine der spiegel .
a full 40 percent of doctors indicated they could imagine helping a patient end his or her life , the survey found .
and 16 percent of doctors said they could envision themselves taking the lead role in helping a patient commit suicide .
assisted suicide became a hot topic in germany earlier this year after roger kusch , an ex-senator in hamburg , advised an elderly woman on how to prepare a deadly cocktail of drugs .
in the wake of the woman 's suicide , politicians have called for laws that would make it illegal for anyone to help someone kill themselves or give them advice on how to do so .
violation of medical ethics the doctors taking part in the survey were general practitioners , oncologists , internists , anesthesiologists or palliative medicine practitioners who deal with extremely ill patients in hospitals .
the survey found that 3.3 percent admitted to having helped patients commit suicide on one or more occasions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most doctors have little training in end-of-life care in germany , assisted suicide is illegal , as long as no one physically helps end the person 's life .
but doctor-assisted suicide is widely viewed in germany as violating the code of professional medical conduct and is seen as going against doctors ' legal duties to save lives .
assisted suicide also has also been stigmatized due to the nazi eugenics programs which killed more than 70,000 mentally ill and handicapped people .
hospice organization decries attitude in the survey , 44.5 percent of the doctors said that if they were in the situation of being terminally ill , they would want a colleague to be allowed to help them commit suicide .
nearly one in three said they would want " active " help from a doctor .
germany 's hospice organization said that the results show the need for more ethical training for the medical profession and more money for terminal care .
for the german hospice association , the survey shows " what a bad handle doctors have on ethical and medical questions . "
only four percent of terminally ill patients had access to professional end-of-life care in the last 12 months before their deaths , said eugen brysch , who heads the hospice association .
he said that many doctors can not differentiate between " allowing someone to die " and " killing " someone .
the hospice organization wants to see the german government , as well as states and medical groups , invest 30 million euros -lrb- $ 38 million -rrb- each year in ethics training . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a full 35 percent would support rules allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients end their lives . the anonymous survey of 483 doctors was conducted for the german news magazine der spiegel .
a full 40 percent of doctors indicated they could imagine helping a patient end his or her life , the survey found .
and 16 percent of doctors said they could envision themselves taking the lead role in helping a patient commit suicide .
assisted suicide became a hot topic in germany earlier this year after roger kusch , an ex-senator in hamburg , advised an elderly woman on how to prepare a deadly cocktail of drugs .
in the wake of the woman 's suicide , politicians have called for laws that would make it illegal for anyone to help someone kill themselves or give them advice on how to do so .
violation of medical ethics the doctors taking part in the survey were general practitioners , oncologists , internists , anesthesiologists or palliative medicine practitioners who deal with extremely ill patients in hospitals .

assisted suicide also has also been stigmatized due to the nazi eugenics programs which killed more than 70,000 mentally ill and handicapped people .
hospice organization decries attitude in the survey , 44.5 percent of the doctors said that if they were in the situation of being terminally ill , they would want a colleague to be allowed to help them commit suicide .
nearly one in three said they would want " active " help from a doctor .
germany 's hospice organization said that the results show the need for more ethical training for the medical profession and more money for terminal care .
for the german hospice association , the survey shows " what a bad handle doctors have on ethical and medical questions . "
only four percent of terminally ill patients had access to professional end-of-life care in the last 12 months before their deaths , said eugen brysch , who heads the hospice association .
he said that many doctors can not differentiate between " allowing someone to die " and " killing " someone .

a full 35 percent would support rules allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients end their lives . the anonymous survey of 483 doctors was conducted for the german news magazine der spiegel .
a full 40 percent of doctors indicated they could imagine helping a patient end his or her life , the survey found .
and 16 percent of doctors said they could envision themselves taking the lead role in helping a patient commit suicide .
assisted suicide became a hot topic in germany earlier this year after roger kusch , an ex-senator in hamburg , advised an elderly woman on how to prepare a deadly cocktail of drugs .
in the wake of the woman 's suicide , politicians have called for laws that would make it illegal for anyone to help someone kill themselves or give them advice on how to do so .
violation of medical ethics the doctors taking part in the survey were general practitioners , oncologists , internists , anesthesiologists or palliative medicine practitioners who deal with extremely ill patients in hospitals .
the survey found that 3.3 percent admitted to having helped patients commit suicide on one or more occasions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most doctors have little training in end-of-life care in germany , assisted suicide is illegal , as long as no one physically helps end the person 's life .
but doctor-assisted suicide is widely viewed in germany as violating the code of professional medical conduct and is seen as going against doctors ' legal duties to save lives .
assisted suicide also has also been stigmatized due to the nazi eugenics programs which killed more than 70,000 mentally ill and handicapped people .
hospice organization decries attitude in the survey , 44.5 percent of the doctors said that if they were in the situation of being terminally ill , they would want a colleague to be allowed to help them commit suicide .
nearly one in three said they would want " active " help from a doctor .
germany 's hospice organization said that the results show the need for more ethical training for the medical profession and more money for terminal care .
for the german hospice association , the survey shows " what a bad handle doctors have on ethical and medical questions . "
only four percent of terminally ill patients had access to professional end-of-life care in the last 12 months before their deaths , said eugen brysch , who heads the hospice association .
he said that many doctors can not differentiate between " allowing someone to die " and " killing " someone .

24 against rushing into adopting a europe-wide economic stimulus package and ruled out reducing value-added tax in germany after talks with french president sarkozy . speaking after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , merkel said the seriousness of the current economic downturn called for a timely and measured approach to the situation .
" the risk that we are running today , taking into account information that is not always easy -lrb- to interpret -rrb- , is that we mistake haste for action , " she said .
vat cuts ' not right ' for germany both sarkozy and merkel also said their countries would not undertake a uk-style slashing of value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to stimulate spending as a way of fighting the financial crisis .
" a lower vat is not the right solution for france and germany , " merkel said .
" we are both agreed . "
sarkozy said lowering vat may be a viable option for other countries , such as britain , but agreed that it was a wrong fit for paris and berlin .
" when we lower the vat , what does that bring ?
only lower prices , " sarkozy said .
" we think other measures , such as emphasizing innovation and research , would be more effective for our economies . "

" we acted together on the crisis .

heat is on germany germany , as europe 's largest and the world 's third largest economy , has been under pressure in recent weeks to do more to help kick-start the european economy .
merkel 's government has already pledged 1.3 percent of gdp to energize the german economy , but brussels is to request a further 1 percent of gdp to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany 's contribution would translate to around 25 billion euros .
the stimulus package plan is to be unveiled by the european commission on wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .

" the risk that we are running today , taking into account information that is not always easy -lrb- to interpret -rrb- , is that we mistake haste for action , " she said .

" a lower vat is not the right solution for france and germany , " merkel said .
" we are both agreed . "
sarkozy said lowering vat may be a viable option for other countries , such as britain , but agreed that it was a wrong fit for paris and berlin .
" when we lower the vat , what does that bring ?
only lower prices , " sarkozy said .
" we think other measures , such as emphasizing innovation and research , would be more effective for our economies . "

merkel 's government has already pledged 1.3 percent of gdp to energize the german economy , but brussels is to request a further 1 percent of gdp to help pull the continent out of the financial doldrums .
germany 's contribution would translate to around 25 billion euros .
the stimulus package plan is to be unveiled by the european commission on wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .

yet many unanswered questions about the incident remain , including whether the men belonged to germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- . max stadler of the free democratic party told the berliner zeitung that he wanted a meeting of the parliamentary committee tasked with overseeing the bnd . " i expect the government and the heads of the bnd to inform the members of parliament , " stadler told the newspaper in an interview published monday , nov .
24 .
" i want to know if the arrestees are bnd employees . " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said monday that the suspects were not registered as intelligence agents . " i have no information on their accreditation .
they could have entered kosovo in a private capacity , " he said , declining to comment further while the investigation is in process . suspects remain jailed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three men have denied the allegations leveled against them , according to media reports lawyers of the men said prosecutors were trying to link their clients to " acts of terrorism , " punishable with up to 20 years in prison . " three german citizens suspected for the explosion ... have to stay one month in detention " the daily express reported sunday according to afp news agency . the kosovar paper added that the germans were " suspected of conducting a criminal act of terrorism . " attorney adem ademi told germany 's dpa news agency in pristina that " some documents " identifying the suspects as bnd agents bnd " were found and presented as evidence , " but he expressed doubts about the documents ' authenticity . asked whether the prosecutor identified the arrested germans as members of the bnd , ademi said : " they are suspected of being members of secret services , but they have n't said explicitly which one . " kosovo and german media reports have claimed the suspects were working for the bnd .
berlin officials have not commented on the allegations . pristina power struggle german terrorism and security expert elmar thevessen told dw-radio that problems within kosovo 's government might be responsible for the detention .
while some within the government support an eu mission that 's due to assume oversight of law-enforcement in kosovo after more than eight years as a united nations protectorate , others reject it . " it looks to me that it is a matter of political intrigue within kosovo , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense at all for the german intelligence service to get involved in a bomb going off in an office of the european union .
as a matter of fact the german government has been known to be one of the biggest supporters of that mission . " thevessen added that bnd agents were also investigating organized crime ties to the kosovo government and that this might be yet another reason why local officials were trying to get rid of them . agents claim innocence police arrested the three germans on wednesday , five days after an explosive device was hurled at the office of the eu 's special representative for the region .
no one was injured in the blast . the three germans said they were inspecting damage done by the bomb blast and were not involved in the attack , according to german media reports . german mass-tabloid bild reported sunday that the bomb attack had been the work of an anti-eu faction of kosovars . anti-eu faction in charge ? the paper said german foreign ministry officials on friday had won an assurance from the kosovo government that there would be no objection to releasing the trio arrested two days earlier . but the faction opposed to european union supervision of the new state won the upper hand on saturday , when the men were committed to custody . kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and pristina , belgrade , the un and eu are currently wrangling over the conditions for the deployment of the eu mission , eulex , comprising 2,000 police , judicial and customs officials . more than 50 states , including the united states and most eu members , have since recognized kosovo . dw staff -lrb- sms / win / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet many unanswered questions about the incident remain , including whether the men belonged to germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- . max stadler of the free democratic party told the berliner zeitung that he wanted a meeting of the parliamentary committee tasked with overseeing the bnd . " i expect the government and the heads of the bnd to inform the members of parliament , " stadler told the newspaper in an interview published monday , nov .
24 .
" i want to know if the arrestees are bnd employees . " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said monday that the suspects were not registered as intelligence agents . " i have no information on their accreditation .
they could have entered kosovo in a private capacity , " he said , declining to comment further while the investigation is in process . suspects remain jailed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three men have denied the allegations leveled against them , according to media reports lawyers of the men said prosecutors were trying to link their clients to " acts of terrorism , " punishable with up to 20 years in prison . " three german citizens suspected for the explosion ... have to stay one month in detention " the daily express reported sunday according to afp news agency . the kosovar paper added that the germans were " suspected of conducting a criminal act of terrorism . " attorney adem ademi told germany 's dpa news agency in pristina that " some documents " identifying the suspects as bnd agents bnd " were found and presented as evidence , " but he expressed doubts about the documents ' authenticity . asked whether the prosecutor identified the arrested germans as members of the bnd , ademi said : " they are suspected of being members of secret services , but they have n't said explicitly which one . " kosovo and german media reports have claimed the suspects were working for the bnd .
berlin officials have not commented on the allegations . pristina power struggle german terrorism and security expert elmar thevessen told dw-radio that problems within kosovo 's government might be responsible for the detention .
while some within the government support an eu mission that 's due to assume oversight of law-enforcement in kosovo after more than eight years as a united nations protectorate , others reject it . " it looks to me that it is a matter of political intrigue within kosovo , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense at all for the german intelligence service to get involved in a bomb going off in an office of the european union .
as a matter of fact the german government has been known to be one of the biggest supporters of that mission . " thevessen added that bnd agents were also investigating organized crime ties to the kosovo government and that this might be yet another reason why local officials were trying to get rid of them . agents claim innocence police arrested the three germans on wednesday , five days after an explosive device was hurled at the office of the eu 's special representative for the region .
no one was injured in the blast . the three germans said they were inspecting damage done by the bomb blast and were not involved in the attack , according to german media reports . german mass-tabloid bild reported sunday that the bomb attack had been the work of an anti-eu faction of kosovars . anti-eu faction in charge ? the paper said german foreign ministry officials on friday had won an assurance from the kosovo government that there would be no objection to releasing the trio arrested two days earlier . but the faction opposed to european union supervision of the new state won the upper hand on saturday , when the men were committed to custody . kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and pristina , belgrade , the un and eu are currently wrangling over the conditions for the deployment of the eu mission , eulex , comprising 2,000 police , judicial and customs officials . more than 50 states , including the united states and most eu members , have since recognized kosovo . dw staff -lrb- sms / win / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their breakthrough was made possible by studies in the late 1990s revealing that some people were resistant to hiv / aids , according to a report in new scientist magazine on the berlin hematologists ' discovery .
in these people , the virus can not enter and destroy the white blood cells that it infects and destroys in most other people .
they owed their resistance to a mutation in the gene which makes the molecular " door handle " by which hiv / aids gains access to cells .
called ccr5 , the protein door handle was misshapen in the immune individuals , locking hiv / aids out of their white blood cells , the new scientist report noted .

to treat the leukemia , the two doctors did the usual thing and sought a bone marrow donor to replenish the patient 's blood supply following chemotherapy to kill the existing , cancerous blood cells .
but the berlin doctors ' new approach was to get a donor who had the double hiv-resistant ccr5 mutation .
this meant that the patient 's replenished blood system would effectively be resistant to hiv / aids , locking out the virus for good .
this is what appears to have happened , according to the new scientist analysis , and huetter declared his patient " functionally cured . "
building on previous attempts several attempts to use bone marrow transplants in hiv / aids treatment have been made since the 1980s .
in one case , a patient with both hiv / aids and lymphoma died of the cancer two months later , but was found to harbor no hiv / aids .
it was not known if something in the transplant had protected him .
and in a famous 1995 case , jeff getty , a prominent san francisco advocate for hiv / aids patients , received bone marrow from a baboon , which is resistant to the human virus .
the new york times reported that he survived for 11 years , but died of hiv / aids and cancer .
the times said the transplant had not protected him but anti-retroviral triple therapy had been invented in time to help .

their breakthrough was made possible by studies in the late 1990s revealing that some people were resistant to hiv / aids , according to a report in new scientist magazine on the berlin hematologists ' discovery .
in these people , the virus can not enter and destroy the white blood cells that it infects and destroys in most other people .
they owed their resistance to a mutation in the gene which makes the molecular " door handle " by which hiv / aids gains access to cells .

yet many unanswered questions about the incident remain , including whether the men belonged to germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- . max stadler of the free democratic party told the berliner zeitung that he wanted a meeting of the parliamentary committee tasked with overseeing the bnd . " i expect the government and the heads of the bnd to inform the members of parliament , " stadler told the newspaper in an interview published monday , nov .
24 .
" i want to know if the arrestees are bnd employees . " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said monday that the suspects were not registered as intelligence agents . " i have no information on their accreditation .
they could have entered kosovo in a private capacity , " he said , declining to comment further while the investigation is in process . suspects remain jailed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three men have denied the allegations leveled against them , according to media reports lawyers of the men said prosecutors were trying to link their clients to " acts of terrorism , " punishable with up to 20 years in prison . " three german citizens suspected for the explosion ... have to stay one month in detention " the daily express reported sunday according to afp news agency . the kosovar paper added that the germans were " suspected of conducting a criminal act of terrorism . " attorney adem ademi told germany 's dpa news agency in pristina that " some documents " identifying the suspects as bnd agents bnd " were found and presented as evidence , " but he expressed doubts about the documents ' authenticity . asked whether the prosecutor identified the arrested germans as members of the bnd , ademi said : " they are suspected of being members of secret services , but they have n't said explicitly which one . " kosovo and german media reports have claimed the suspects were working for the bnd .
berlin officials have not commented on the allegations . pristina power struggle german terrorism and security expert elmar thevessen told dw-radio that problems within kosovo 's government might be responsible for the detention .
while some within the government support an eu mission that 's due to assume oversight of law-enforcement in kosovo after more than eight years as a united nations protectorate , others reject it . " it looks to me that it is a matter of political intrigue within kosovo , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense at all for the german intelligence service to get involved in a bomb going off in an office of the european union .
as a matter of fact the german government has been known to be one of the biggest supporters of that mission . " thevessen added that bnd agents were also investigating organized crime ties to the kosovo government and that this might be yet another reason why local officials were trying to get rid of them . agents claim innocence police arrested the three germans on wednesday , five days after an explosive device was hurled at the office of the eu 's special representative for the region .
no one was injured in the blast . the three germans said they were inspecting damage done by the bomb blast and were not involved in the attack , according to german media reports . german mass-tabloid bild reported sunday that the bomb attack had been the work of an anti-eu faction of kosovars . anti-eu faction in charge ? the paper said german foreign ministry officials on friday had won an assurance from the kosovo government that there would be no objection to releasing the trio arrested two days earlier . but the faction opposed to european union supervision of the new state won the upper hand on saturday , when the men were committed to custody . kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and pristina , belgrade , the un and eu are currently wrangling over the conditions for the deployment of the eu mission , eulex , comprising 2,000 police , judicial and customs officials . more than 50 states , including the united states and most eu members , have since recognized kosovo . dw staff -lrb- sms / win / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government will ask more than one hundred other countries which ratified the treaty for another 10 more years .
campaigners say the move this week could damage the uk 's international reputation and set a bad example that other nations may try to follow .
the foreign office said the remoteness of the falklands and its varied terrain made the clearance very difficult .
angus crawford reports .
there are thought be about 20,000 unexploded landmines on the falkland islands planted by argentine forces in 1982 .
barbed wire mike summers is spokesman for the islands legislative council .
the nearest mines are just a five-minute drive away from his office in the capital stanley .
" you see beautiful sand hills ... surrounded with barbed wire with all sorts of mine signs on , saying it 's very dangerous , " he said .
but surprisingly , despite living with them for the last 25 years , he says the population is not calling for them to be cleared .
" we 're rather agnostic about this . "
" if the money they were thinking of spending here could be better spent in one of those areas where children are still getting their legs blown off … we would be more than happy with that " mike summers , falkland islands he explains that no civilians have been injured and that with the mined areas covering 0.1 % of potential farming land , no-one has any need to venture near them .
" clearing the mines here is neither an economic nor a serious social issue , " says mr summers .
" if the money they were thinking of spending here could be better spent in one of those areas where children are still getting their legs blown off … we would be more than happy with that . "
but in 1997 the uk signed the ottawa convention banning landmines which also imposed a duty to clear the weapons .
dunes to mountains britain was given until march next year , but has now said this is not possible .
the foreign office said the sheer range of terrain - from dunes to mountains , rock screes and pastures - requires a wide range of techniques that are expensive and time consuming .
added to this , is the sheer distance of the falkland islands from the uk .
at 7,000 miles -lrb- 11,265 km -rrb- sea freight takes four to six weeks ' travel time from britain .
so , under article five of the treaty , britain is asking the other signatories to give it another 10 years , and this week more than 100 countries meet again in geneva and will have to consider the request . "
other countries then might say since the uk has not de-mined the falklands , we want to do the same " prince mired bin raad al-hussein prince mired bin raad al-hussein was president of the last meeting of the countries which signed the treaty .
he is also chairman of the group looking at the uk 's plan and has voiced concerns over the request .
he said : " it 's been quite a difficult issue for us . "
he was educated in britain and is quick to praise its de-mining work around the world , but he is worried that this could set a bad precedent .
" other countries then might say , ' since the uk has not de-mined the falklands , we want to do the same ' . "
in reality it is unlikely that the signatory countries will refuse the uk 's request .
' fragile treaty ' the fear is that in the future the uk will be less able to demand other countries fulfil their obligations .
there is also a concern that if the uk 's request is granted but with reservations it could show up weaknesses within the treaty .
this second possibility is what concerns seb taylor , chief executive of the non-governmental organisation landmine action .
he said : " the worst-case scenario is that it is passed with a number of abstentions .
it will show the fragility of these kinds of treaties . "
" i think it reflects badly on the uk as one of the leading state signatories , " he added .
unnecessary depletion mr taylor points out that the british government gives £ 10m a year to clearance operations around the world and has a good reputation when it comes to arms control .

the government will ask more than one hundred other countries which ratified the treaty for another 10 more years .
campaigners say the move this week could damage the uk 's international reputation and set a bad example that other nations may try to follow .
the foreign office said the remoteness of the falklands and its varied terrain made the clearance very difficult .
angus crawford reports .
there are thought be about 20,000 unexploded landmines on the falkland islands planted by argentine forces in 1982 .
barbed wire mike summers is spokesman for the islands legislative council .
the nearest mines are just a five-minute drive away from his office in the capital stanley .
" you see beautiful sand hills ... surrounded with barbed wire with all sorts of mine signs on , saying it 's very dangerous , " he said .
but surprisingly , despite living with them for the last 25 years , he says the population is not calling for them to be cleared .
" we 're rather agnostic about this . "
if the money they were thinking of spending here could be better spent in one of those areas where children are still getting their legs blown off … we would be more than happy with that mike summers , falkland islands he explains that no civilians have been injured and that with the mined areas covering 0.1 % of potential farming land , no-one has any need to venture near them .
" clearing the mines here is neither an economic nor a serious social issue , " says mr summers .
" if the money they were thinking of spending here could be better spent in one of those areas where children are still getting their legs blown off … we would be more than happy with that . "
but in 1997 the uk signed the ottawa convention banning landmines which also imposed a duty to clear the weapons .
dunes to mountains britain was given until march next year , but has now said this is not possible .
the foreign office said the sheer range of terrain - from dunes to mountains , rock screes and pastures - requires a wide range of techniques that are expensive and time consuming .
added to this , is the sheer distance of the falkland islands from the uk .
at 7,000 miles -lrb- 11,265 km -rrb- sea freight takes four to six weeks ' travel time from britain .
so , under article five of the treaty , britain is asking the other signatories to give it another 10 years , and this week more than 100 countries meet again in geneva and will have to consider the request .
other countries then might say since the uk has not de-mined the falklands , we want to do the same prince mired bin raad al-hussein prince mired bin raad al-hussein was president of the last meeting of the countries which signed the treaty .
he is also chairman of the group looking at the uk 's plan and has voiced concerns over the request .
he said : " it 's been quite a difficult issue for us . "
he was educated in britain and is quick to praise its de-mining work around the world , but he is worried that this could set a bad precedent .
" other countries then might say , ' since the uk has not de-mined the falklands , we want to do the same ' . "
in reality it is unlikely that the signatory countries will refuse the uk 's request .
' fragile treaty ' the fear is that in the future the uk will be less able to demand other countries fulfil their obligations .
there is also a concern that if the uk 's request is granted but with reservations it could show up weaknesses within the treaty .
this second possibility is what concerns seb taylor , chief executive of the non-governmental organisation landmine action .
he said : " the worst-case scenario is that it is passed with a number of abstentions .
it will show the fragility of these kinds of treaties . "
" i think it reflects badly on the uk as one of the leading state signatories , " he added .

the government will ask more than one hundred other countries which ratified the treaty for another 10 more years .
campaigners say the move this week could damage the uk 's international reputation and set a bad example that other nations may try to follow .
the foreign office said the remoteness of the falklands and its varied terrain made the clearance very difficult .
angus crawford reports .
there are thought be about 20,000 unexploded landmines on the falkland islands planted by argentine forces in 1982 .
barbed wire mike summers is spokesman for the islands legislative council .
the nearest mines are just a five-minute drive away from his office in the capital stanley .
" you see beautiful sand hills ... surrounded with barbed wire with all sorts of mine signs on , saying it 's very dangerous , " he said .
but surprisingly , despite living with them for the last 25 years , he says the population is not calling for them to be cleared .
" we 're rather agnostic about this . "
if the money they were thinking of spending here could be better spent in one of those areas where children are still getting their legs blown off … we would be more than happy with that mike summers , falkland islands he explains that no civilians have been injured and that with the mined areas covering 0.1 % of potential farming land , no-one has any need to venture near them .
" clearing the mines here is neither an economic nor a serious social issue , " says mr summers .
" if the money they were thinking of spending here could be better spent in one of those areas where children are still getting their legs blown off … we would be more than happy with that . "
but in 1997 the uk signed the ottawa convention banning landmines which also imposed a duty to clear the weapons .
dunes to mountains britain was given until march next year , but has now said this is not possible .
the foreign office said the sheer range of terrain - from dunes to mountains , rock screes and pastures - requires a wide range of techniques that are expensive and time consuming .
added to this , is the sheer distance of the falkland islands from the uk .
at 7,000 miles -lrb- 11,265 km -rrb- sea freight takes four to six weeks ' travel time from britain .
so , under article five of the treaty , britain is asking the other signatories to give it another 10 years , and this week more than 100 countries meet again in geneva and will have to consider the request .
other countries then might say since the uk has not de-mined the falklands , we want to do the same prince mired bin raad al-hussein prince mired bin raad al-hussein was president of the last meeting of the countries which signed the treaty .
he is also chairman of the group looking at the uk 's plan and has voiced concerns over the request .
he said : " it 's been quite a difficult issue for us . "
he was educated in britain and is quick to praise its de-mining work around the world , but he is worried that this could set a bad precedent .
" other countries then might say , ' since the uk has not de-mined the falklands , we want to do the same ' . "
in reality it is unlikely that the signatory countries will refuse the uk 's request .
' fragile treaty ' the fear is that in the future the uk will be less able to demand other countries fulfil their obligations .
there is also a concern that if the uk 's request is granted but with reservations it could show up weaknesses within the treaty .
this second possibility is what concerns seb taylor , chief executive of the non-governmental organisation landmine action .
he said : " the worst-case scenario is that it is passed with a number of abstentions .
it will show the fragility of these kinds of treaties . "
" i think it reflects badly on the uk as one of the leading state signatories , " he added .
unnecessary depletion mr taylor points out that the british government gives £ 10m a year to clearance operations around the world and has a good reputation when it comes to arms control .
" it seems to be me this would be depleted unnecessarily . "
the foreign office stresses that clearing the falklands will be costly , difficult and possibly damaging to the environment and it points out that 14 other countries are also applying for more time .
a spokesman said : " the uk is fully compliant with all other aspects of the convention , which sends a positive message to all other ... parties . "
that leaves mike summers and his fellow islanders stuck in the middle of a problem they did n't create .
" the uk government does have this obligation ; the fact they ca n't deliver is i guess regrettable , " he concedes .

most are blessed with all the elements to help compete on a global stage - abundant natural resources , a young population and the climate and conditions to be a major agricultural force .
and yet today , my continent , which is home to 10 % of the world 's population , represents just 1 % of global trade .
i have no doubt we have to take responsibility for our failures .
we ca n't afford to keep playing the blame game .
but when 50 years of foreign aid has failed to lift africa out of poverty , could corruption be the reason ?
could that really be all there is to it ?
causes of corruption the symptoms of corruption are easy to spot .
teachers demand bribes from their students because they can not get by on their wages .
government officials , doctors and nurses steal drugs meant for their patients to sell on the black market .
african leaders have property portfolios across the globe , while their citizens live on $ 1 a day or less .
but searching for the causes , i had to ask myself some difficult questions .
people often say a nation gets the government it deserves .
and we africans have certainly made some bad choices in terms of leaders , but all too often western aid has ended up bankrolling them .
aid has offered legitimacy to corrupt and autocratic regimes , allowing them to hang on to power even when they have lost popularity with their own citizens .
while we were filming inside uganda 's largest hospital , mulago hospital , these thoughts came sharply into focus .
we saw dozens of mothers with their newborn babies lying on the blood-splattered floor next to disposed needles .
have your say " the aid has had little effect because the aid never gets to the people and the organisations that need it " cb , london send us your comments victims of road accidents were hauled into hospital by relatives because there are few porters , few trolleys and even fewer ambulances .
some patients were even left to bleed on the floor .
these are images i have seen repeated all over africa and it left me wondering , why we africans can not demand greater accountability from our leaders .
why do they keep getting away with this level of neglect ?
but i was quickly reminded of the proverb taught as a nursery rhyme to african children - he who pays the piper calls the tune .
many sub-saharan african countries have had high levels of aid dependence - in excess of 10 % of gross domestic product , or half of government spending - for decades .
when half the government budget comes from aid , african leaders find themselves less inclined to tax their citizens .
as a result , governments that are highly dependent on aid pay too much attention to donors and too little to the actual needs of their own citizens .
and unfortunately donors have their own objectives which are not always the same as the citizens of african countries .
' rewarding failure ' building new schools and clinics in record numbers looks good on paper and makes politicians look good in front of voters back home .
but when these clinics lack the most basic facilities and there are not enough teachers in the classroom , it is the ordinary africans who get a raw deal .
another criticism of aid increasingly voiced by africans , but rarely heard in the west is that it sponsors failure , but rarely rewards success .
while i was filming in uganda , local newspaper editor andrew mwenda took me and my crew to his home village near the town of port loco in the west of the country .
there he introduced us to two men , one in his sixties and one aged 26 .
" this man represents the tragedy of aid , " he said pointing to the older of the two .
" while this man represents the potential of aid , " he said indicating the younger man .
mr mwenda explained that the sexagenarian was the chairman of the local parish council who had spent most of his life living off aid money , supervising projects meant to benefit the community .
today he is an alcoholic who still lives with his mother .
dysfunctional lifestyle the younger man started selling potatoes in the village square at the age of 17 .
less than 10 years later he owns the largest and busiest store in the village .
he has not received one penny from aid , yet he has bought himself land and has built a house .
" so you see , " mr mwenda said .
" if aid were to offer this young man support in the form of low interest credit he could not only expand his business offering employment opportunities and a valuable service to his community , he could also eventually pay the money back . "
but instead of funding innovation and creativity , aid has funded the chairman 's dysfunctional lifestyle .
prolonged aid programmes also have wider implications for developing economies .
thirty years of aid dollars flowing into the ugandan economy has left the country suffering from what economists refer to as the " dutch disease " .
large inflows of foreign currency push up the value of the ugandan shilling making its agricultural and manufactured goods less price competitive .
this results in fewer exports and less home-grown , sustainable earnings for the country .
local entrepreneurs such as coffee growers and flower exporters should be cashing in on rising food and commodity prices across the globe at the moment , but they are finding themselves crowded out of their own economy by foreign aid dollars .
graduates lost small african producers also have to compete with heavily subsided products from europe and north america .
uganda 's cotton industry is capable of exporting almost half a million bales per year , but so far in 2008 the country has only managed 160,000 bales .
high government subsidies for north american cotton farmers prevent ugandan producers from offering competitive prices in international markets .
in their glossy pamphlets and on the pages of their high-spec websites , donors tend to wax lyrical about the importance of trade to africa 's future , yet very little progress has been made on opening up international markets .
african producers still represent just 1 % of global trade .
and at least 70,000 skilled graduates abandon the continent every year , often trained by western aid , but unable to stay in the market because salaries are so low .
until these gifted and enterprising people can be attracted to return , most of the world 's peacekeeping efforts , on the continent , and certainly most of its aid , will have little effect .

advertisement secret filming of a chemist caught trying to sell aid by sorious samura bbc panorama reporter where i come from in west africa , we have a saying : " a fool at 40 is a fool forever " , and most african countries have now been independent for over 40 years .
most are blessed with all the elements to help compete on a global stage - abundant natural resources , a young population and the climate and conditions to be a major agricultural force .
and yet today , my continent , which is home to 10 % of the world 's population , represents just 1 % of global trade .
i have no doubt we have to take responsibility for our failures .
we ca n't afford to keep playing the blame game .
but when 50 years of foreign aid has failed to lift africa out of poverty , could corruption be the reason ?
could that really be all there is to it ?
causes of corruption the symptoms of corruption are easy to spot .
teachers demand bribes from their students because they can not get by on their wages .
government officials , doctors and nurses steal drugs meant for their patients to sell on the black market .
african leaders have property portfolios across the globe , while their citizens live on $ 1 a day or less .
it is in the classroom that many get their first taste of corruption but searching for the causes , i had to ask myself some difficult questions .
people often say a nation gets the government it deserves .
and we africans have certainly made some bad choices in terms of leaders , but all too often western aid has ended up bankrolling them .
aid has offered legitimacy to corrupt and autocratic regimes , allowing them to hang on to power even when they have lost popularity with their own citizens .
while we were filming inside uganda 's largest hospital , mulago hospital , these thoughts came sharply into focus .
we saw dozens of mothers with their newborn babies lying on the blood-splattered floor next to disposed needles .
have your say the aid has had little effect because the aid never gets to the people and the organisations that need it cb , london send us your comments victims of road accidents were hauled into hospital by relatives because there are few porters , few trolleys and even fewer ambulances .
some patients were even left to bleed on the floor .
these are images i have seen repeated all over africa and it left me wondering , why we africans can not demand greater accountability from our leaders .
why do they keep getting away with this level of neglect ?
but i was quickly reminded of the proverb taught as a nursery rhyme to african children - he who pays the piper calls the tune .
despite huge aid efforts for the very poorest africans little has changed many sub-saharan african countries have had high levels of aid dependence - in excess of 10 % of gross domestic product , or half of government spending - for decades .
when half the government budget comes from aid , african leaders find themselves less inclined to tax their citizens .
as a result , governments that are highly dependent on aid pay too much attention to donors and too little to the actual needs of their own citizens .
and unfortunately donors have their own objectives which are not always the same as the citizens of african countries .
' rewarding failure ' building new schools and clinics in record numbers looks good on paper and makes politicians look good in front of voters back home .
but when these clinics lack the most basic facilities and there are not enough teachers in the classroom , it is the ordinary africans who get a raw deal .
another criticism of aid increasingly voiced by africans , but rarely heard in the west is that it sponsors failure , but rarely rewards success .
one fifth of children in sierra leone will not see their fifth birthday while i was filming in uganda , local newspaper editor andrew mwenda took me and my crew to his home village near the town of port loco in the west of the country .
there he introduced us to two men , one in his sixties and one aged 26 .
" this man represents the tragedy of aid , " he said pointing to the older of the two .
" while this man represents the potential of aid , " he said indicating the younger man .
mr mwenda explained that the sexagenarian was the chairman of the local parish council who had spent most of his life living off aid money , supervising projects meant to benefit the community .
today he is an alcoholic who still lives with his mother .
dysfunctional lifestyle the younger man started selling potatoes in the village square at the age of 17 .
less than 10 years later he owns the largest and busiest store in the village .
he has not received one penny from aid , yet he has bought himself land and has built a house .
" so you see , " mr mwenda said .
" if aid were to offer this young man support in the form of low interest credit he could not only expand his business offering employment opportunities and a valuable service to his community , he could also eventually pay the money back . "
in mulago hospital injured people lay on the blood-spattered floor but instead of funding innovation and creativity , aid has funded the chairman 's dysfunctional lifestyle .
prolonged aid programmes also have wider implications for developing economies .
thirty years of aid dollars flowing into the ugandan economy has left the country suffering from what economists refer to as the " dutch disease " .
large inflows of foreign currency push up the value of the ugandan shilling making its agricultural and manufactured goods less price competitive .
this results in fewer exports and less home-grown , sustainable earnings for the country .
local entrepreneurs such as coffee growers and flower exporters should be cashing in on rising food and commodity prices across the globe at the moment , but they are finding themselves crowded out of their own economy by foreign aid dollars .
graduates lost small african producers also have to compete with heavily subsided products from europe and north america .
and in the labour ward mothers and their newborns are often without a bed uganda 's cotton industry is capable of exporting almost half a million bales per year , but so far in 2008 the country has only managed 160,000 bales .
high government subsidies for north american cotton farmers prevent ugandan producers from offering competitive prices in international markets .
in their glossy pamphlets and on the pages of their high-spec websites , donors tend to wax lyrical about the importance of trade to africa 's future , yet very little progress has been made on opening up international markets .
african producers still represent just 1 % of global trade .
and at least 70,000 skilled graduates abandon the continent every year , often trained by western aid , but unable to stay in the market because salaries are so low .
until these gifted and enterprising people can be attracted to return , most of the world 's peacekeeping efforts , on the continent , and certainly most of its aid , will have little effect .

but when 50 years of foreign aid has failed to lift africa out of poverty , could corruption be the reason ?
could that really be all there is to it ?
causes of corruption the symptoms of corruption are easy to spot .
teachers demand bribes from their students because they can not get by on their wages .
government officials , doctors and nurses steal drugs meant for their patients to sell on the black market .
african leaders have property portfolios across the globe , while their citizens live on $ 1 a day or less .
it is in the classroom that many get their first taste of corruption but searching for the causes , i had to ask myself some difficult questions .
people often say a nation gets the government it deserves .
and we africans have certainly made some bad choices in terms of leaders , but all too often western aid has ended up bankrolling them .
aid has offered legitimacy to corrupt and autocratic regimes , allowing them to hang on to power even when they have lost popularity with their own citizens .
while we were filming inside uganda 's largest hospital , mulago hospital , these thoughts came sharply into focus .
we saw dozens of mothers with their newborn babies lying on the blood-splattered floor next to disposed needles .
have your say the aid has had little effect because the aid never gets to the people and the organisations that need it cb , london send us your comments victims of road accidents were hauled into hospital by relatives because there are few porters , few trolleys and even fewer ambulances .
some patients were even left to bleed on the floor .
these are images i have seen repeated all over africa and it left me wondering , why we africans can not demand greater accountability from our leaders .
why do they keep getting away with this level of neglect ?
but i was quickly reminded of the proverb taught as a nursery rhyme to african children - he who pays the piper calls the tune .
despite huge aid efforts for the very poorest africans little has changed many sub-saharan african countries have had high levels of aid dependence - in excess of 10 % of gross domestic product , or half of government spending - for decades .
when half the government budget comes from aid , african leaders find themselves less inclined to tax their citizens .
as a result , governments that are highly dependent on aid pay too much attention to donors and too little to the actual needs of their own citizens .
and unfortunately donors have their own objectives which are not always the same as the citizens of african countries .
' rewarding failure ' building new schools and clinics in record numbers looks good on paper and makes politicians look good in front of voters back home .
but when these clinics lack the most basic facilities and there are not enough teachers in the classroom , it is the ordinary africans who get a raw deal .
another criticism of aid increasingly voiced by africans , but rarely heard in the west is that it sponsors failure , but rarely rewards success .
one fifth of children in sierra leone will not see their fifth birthday while i was filming in uganda , local newspaper editor andrew mwenda took me and my crew to his home village near the town of port loco in the west of the country .
there he introduced us to two men , one in his sixties and one aged 26 .
" this man represents the tragedy of aid , " he said pointing to the older of the two .
" while this man represents the potential of aid , " he said indicating the younger man .
mr mwenda explained that the sexagenarian was the chairman of the local parish council who had spent most of his life living off aid money , supervising projects meant to benefit the community .
today he is an alcoholic who still lives with his mother .
dysfunctional lifestyle the younger man started selling potatoes in the village square at the age of 17 .
less than 10 years later he owns the largest and busiest store in the village .
he has not received one penny from aid , yet he has bought himself land and has built a house .
" so you see , " mr mwenda said .
" if aid were to offer this young man support in the form of low interest credit he could not only expand his business offering employment opportunities and a valuable service to his community , he could also eventually pay the money back . "
in mulago hospital injured people lay on the blood-spattered floor but instead of funding innovation and creativity , aid has funded the chairman 's dysfunctional lifestyle .
prolonged aid programmes also have wider implications for developing economies .
thirty years of aid dollars flowing into the ugandan economy has left the country suffering from what economists refer to as the " dutch disease " .
large inflows of foreign currency push up the value of the ugandan shilling making its agricultural and manufactured goods less price competitive .
this results in fewer exports and less home-grown , sustainable earnings for the country .
local entrepreneurs such as coffee growers and flower exporters should be cashing in on rising food and commodity prices across the globe at the moment , but they are finding themselves crowded out of their own economy by foreign aid dollars .
graduates lost small african producers also have to compete with heavily subsided products from europe and north america .
and in the labour ward mothers and their newborns are often without a bed uganda 's cotton industry is capable of exporting almost half a million bales per year , but so far in 2008 the country has only managed 160,000 bales .
high government subsidies for north american cotton farmers prevent ugandan producers from offering competitive prices in international markets .
in their glossy pamphlets and on the pages of their high-spec websites , donors tend to wax lyrical about the importance of trade to africa 's future , yet very little progress has been made on opening up international markets .
african producers still represent just 1 % of global trade .
and at least 70,000 skilled graduates abandon the continent every year , often trained by western aid , but unable to stay in the market because salaries are so low .
until these gifted and enterprising people can be attracted to return , most of the world 's peacekeeping efforts , on the continent , and certainly most of its aid , will have little effect .

parking charges were scrapped at singleton hospital in april in line with a new assembly government policy .
but managers say some patients have missed appointments due to being unable to find space in the car park because of non hospital users parking there .
patients will now have to get a free token from staff to exit the car park .
visitors to patients on the wards and others on official hospital business will be able to obtain a token from car parking attendants .
people parking without a genuine reason will have to pay a £ 40 fine to exit from the car park .
the hospital said there was a shortfall of up to 250 spaces at the busiest times .
joanne jones , operational services manager , said : " it 's an important new system because we do n't want to continue with a situation that means patients are left without a space , and with the added stress of missing or being late for their appointments .
departments issuing tokens main outpatients clinic ante-natal clinic paediatric outpatients radiology pathology gynaecology rehabilitation minor injuries unit " while we 've stepped up enforcement against illegitimate users of the car park , we still have many people using the site when they do n't need to .
this is a situation that is unacceptable as it takes spaces from genuine users .
" every car leaving the car park will need a token to open the barrier .
patients will get these when they arrive at their clinic .
" similarly , visitors will need to get a token from a member of our car parking staff and we may ask for evidence that they have had a genuine reason for being at the hospital .
" of course , we want to work closely with the public and make it easy for them to visit singleton .
" we have access to internal systems so we can check as much as possible that the person is genuine , and we hope that visitors will understand that we are trying to ensure that parking is available for legitimate users . "
in april , the hospital threatened to clamp drivers who either parked illegally on double yellow lines or did not have business at the hospital .
staff have their own car park , but will also be allowed to use the visitors ' car park at the weekends under the plans .
but some workers who live close to the hospital and are judged to be able to get to work using alternative methods of transport will no longer be granted permits to park on site , as a method of reducing congestion , abertawe bro morgannwg university nhs trust said .
the welsh assembly government scrapped car parking charges at 120 nhs-owned car parks earlier this year .
a number of hospitals with privately-run car parks will phase charges out as their contracts with the supplier come to an end over the coming years .

advertisement how to dismantle sellafield - a day with the plant 's decommissioning manager in a grand old house on the outskirts of whitehaven in cumbria , a small team of international managers are preparing to take on the task of cleaning up the most intricate nuclear complex in the world .
nuclear management partners -lrb- nmp -rrb- - a consortium representing companies from the us , france and the uk - has been awarded a multi-billion pound contract that could turn into the biggest procurement deal ever signed by the uk government .
nuclear management partners are taking charge of sellafield the task ahead : to sort out the mess left behind after more than half a century of nuclear energy and weapons production at sellafield .
" we want to make a difference , " says nmp 's managing director bob pedde .
" we are committed to reducing site hazards cost-effectively , through clean-up and decommissioning , while maximizing commercial value . "
nmp 's appointment marks the end of british nuclear fuels , better known as bnfl , the monolithic government body that for years was synonymous with the uk nuclear industry .
big clean-up bill currently , neither weapons nor electricity is produced at the sellafield site , though income is earned from reprocessing spent nuclear fuel .
that income partially subsidises the main job at hand , namely the decommissioning of the old nuclear fuel reprocessing plants and nuclear power generators - including the world 's first commercial nuclear power plant , calder hall .
sellafield 's skyline is slowly changing it is just the first in a series of clean-ups of decommissioned nuclear power stations across britain , which could cost between £ 72bn and £ 100bn and take several deades to complete .
most of the uk-wide nuclear cleanup bill will be paid for by tax payers through the government agency nuclear decommissioning authority -lrb- nda -rrb- , which owns the sites .
environmental restoration much has already happened at the sprawling sellafield site .
nuclear management partners urs washington , areva and amec make up the consortium it takes over the management of sellafield on monday 24 november 2008 the contract to dismantle old nuclear power and reprocessing plants lasts five years but could be extended to 17 years the decommissioning costs £ 1.3bn per year to make profits , nmp will have to improve working practices to make savings the company says jobs are safe the distinct cooling towers have been demolished and other high-rise buildings are slowly being picked apart - in some cases , brick by brick - gradually changing the site 's famous skyline .
" sellafield is an environmental restoration project " , insists ian hudson , sellafield programme director at the nda .
these days , much of the work is being carried out by contractors .
nma 's arrival completes a gradual shift from the state to the private sector .
" what people have n't cottoned on to is this huge cultural change in the nuclear industry , " says mr hudson .
taking charge back in nmp 's offices , the light , modern furniture looks out of place in the traditional surroundings .
the shelves contain little other than a few folders .
a few bags of corporate christmas presents are stashed in a corner .
but nmp 's mr pedde will be gone long before christmas .
decommission work is tough and can be dangerous he and his directors are relocating to considerably grittier surroundings at sellafield , where they will replace the current management team and take charge of a 10,000 strong workforce , plus some 2,000 contractors .
the work is challenging , not least because buildings and structures can not simply be demolished until contaminated concrete and other materials have been safely removed .
making matters even trickier is the way age and exposure to acids used to reprocess spent fuel are causing the buildings to crumble .
in many cases buildings and other structures must be strengthened before decommissioning work can start .
long term commitment the decommissioning agency has initially signed up nmp for five years , though the initial £ 6.5bn contract might be extended until 2030 .
the sellafield site is complex and hazardous " the contract is designed to last for 17 years in five-year increments and we intend to be there for the long-term , " says mr pedde .
under the deal , the consortium - which is made up of urs washington from the us , areva from france and amec from the uk - will take over bnfl 's share of and run sellafield ltd .
hence , it is sellafield ltd that will receive the money to pay for the gradual dismantling and clean-up of the facilities on the sellafield , calder hall , windscale and capenhurst sites .
savings from improved working practices will go into a " fee pool " that will be controlled by the nda .
the pool will be used to pay the consortium a fee , based on a broad range of performance targets ranging from training initiatives for staff to safety .
" we incentivise not only what they do but also how they do it , " explains the nda 's mr hudson .
" while it 's a private company , we still have to maintain what the government expects a public body to be . "
the project does not guarantee nmp a profit , though .
to make money , the private management company will have to improve efficiency at the site .
" there is an excellent workforce here .
we are looking forward to partnering them , listening to them and getting their input to discuss what we can do together to maximise efficiencies , " says mr pedde .
" this is not about cutting jobs , it is about maximising the skills at sellafield .
there is more work than this workforce can do in the lifetime plan -lsb- for the site -rsb- . "
no gain , no pay with regards to on-site safety , the consortium and its parent companies ' liability is limited , similar to how the fee structure works , explains mr hudson .
contamination must be removed before the buildings are demolished so if something goes wrong the private operator will only carry the can up to a point , with the government stepping in to bear the bulk of the burden should there be a major disaster .
the indemnity has been controversial , though the government insists it would be wrong to expect a private operator to meet an unlimited - and thus uninsurable - cost .
nmp , for its part , says the risks and rewards are reflected in the pricing and fee structure .
indeed , if nmp 's efforts to change the way sellafield 's workforce operates fails to deliver savings , it will not get paid at all , mr hudson points out .
" if the efficiencies do n't create any fees , they wo n't get it . "
improving industrial relations at the site will therefore be among the first challenges awaiting the new management team .
industrial relations a strike over pay was only just averted in the run-up to the handover , and many on site are apprehensive about their new bosses ' arrival .
it will be nmp 's job to inspire their work ethics while at the same time increase productivity .
part of that process will be to offer them hope of lifelong careers .
" we are on the verge of a global nuclear renaissance and , in the not too distant future the uk government will make some key decisions on potential new nuclear missions , " says mr pedde .
" i want to make sure that sellafield sites and the workforce are in a position to seize whatever potential opportunities these decisions may bring , collectively and as individuals . "

advertisement how to dismantle sellafield - a day with the plant 's decommissioning manager in a grand old house on the outskirts of whitehaven in cumbria , a small team of international managers are preparing to take on the task of cleaning up the most intricate nuclear complex in the world .
nuclear management partners -lrb- nmp -rrb- - a consortium representing companies from the us , france and the uk - has been awarded a multi-billion pound contract that could turn into the biggest procurement deal ever signed by the uk government .
nuclear management partners are taking charge of sellafield the task ahead : to sort out the mess left behind after more than half a century of nuclear energy and weapons production at sellafield .
" we want to make a difference , " says nmp 's managing director bob pedde .
" we are committed to reducing site hazards cost-effectively , through clean-up and decommissioning , while maximizing commercial value . "
nmp 's appointment marks the end of british nuclear fuels , better known as bnfl , the monolithic government body that for years was synonymous with the uk nuclear industry .
big clean-up bill currently , neither weapons nor electricity is produced at the sellafield site , though income is earned from reprocessing spent nuclear fuel .
that income partially subsidises the main job at hand , namely the decommissioning of the old nuclear fuel reprocessing plants and nuclear power generators - including the world 's first commercial nuclear power plant , calder hall .
sellafield 's skyline is slowly changing it is just the first in a series of clean-ups of decommissioned nuclear power stations across britain , which could cost between £ 72bn and £ 100bn and take several deades to complete .
most of the uk-wide nuclear cleanup bill will be paid for by tax payers through the government agency nuclear decommissioning authority -lrb- nda -rrb- , which owns the sites .
environmental restoration much has already happened at the sprawling sellafield site .
nuclear management partners urs washington , areva and amec make up the consortium it takes over the management of sellafield on monday 24 november 2008 the contract to dismantle old nuclear power and reprocessing plants lasts five years but could be extended to 17 years the decommissioning costs £ 1.3bn per year to make profits , nmp will have to improve working practices to make savings the company says jobs are safe the distinct cooling towers have been demolished and other high-rise buildings are slowly being picked apart - in some cases , brick by brick - gradually changing the site 's famous skyline .
" sellafield is an environmental restoration project " , insists ian hudson , sellafield programme director at the nda .
these days , much of the work is being carried out by contractors .
nma 's arrival completes a gradual shift from the state to the private sector .
" what people have n't cottoned on to is this huge cultural change in the nuclear industry , " says mr hudson .
taking charge back in nmp 's offices , the light , modern furniture looks out of place in the traditional surroundings .
the shelves contain little other than a few folders .
a few bags of corporate christmas presents are stashed in a corner .
but nmp 's mr pedde will be gone long before christmas .
decommission work is tough and can be dangerous he and his directors are relocating to considerably grittier surroundings at sellafield , where they will replace the current management team and take charge of a 10,000 strong workforce , plus some 2,000 contractors .
the work is challenging , not least because buildings and structures can not simply be demolished until contaminated concrete and other materials have been safely removed .
making matters even trickier is the way age and exposure to acids used to reprocess spent fuel are causing the buildings to crumble .
in many cases buildings and other structures must be strengthened before decommissioning work can start .
long term commitment the decommissioning agency has initially signed up nmp for five years , though the initial £ 6.5bn contract might be extended until 2030 .
the sellafield site is complex and hazardous " the contract is designed to last for 17 years in five-year increments and we intend to be there for the long-term , " says mr pedde .
under the deal , the consortium - which is made up of urs washington from the us , areva from france and amec from the uk - will take over bnfl 's share of and run sellafield ltd .
hence , it is sellafield ltd that will receive the money to pay for the gradual dismantling and clean-up of the facilities on the sellafield , calder hall , windscale and capenhurst sites .
savings from improved working practices will go into a " fee pool " that will be controlled by the nda .
the pool will be used to pay the consortium a fee , based on a broad range of performance targets ranging from training initiatives for staff to safety .
" we incentivise not only what they do but also how they do it , " explains the nda 's mr hudson .
" while it 's a private company , we still have to maintain what the government expects a public body to be . "
the project does not guarantee nmp a profit , though .
to make money , the private management company will have to improve efficiency at the site .
" there is an excellent workforce here .
we are looking forward to partnering them , listening to them and getting their input to discuss what we can do together to maximise efficiencies , " says mr pedde .
" this is not about cutting jobs , it is about maximising the skills at sellafield .
there is more work than this workforce can do in the lifetime plan -lsb- for the site -rsb- . "
no gain , no pay with regards to on-site safety , the consortium and its parent companies ' liability is limited , similar to how the fee structure works , explains mr hudson .
contamination must be removed before the buildings are demolished so if something goes wrong the private operator will only carry the can up to a point , with the government stepping in to bear the bulk of the burden should there be a major disaster .
the indemnity has been controversial , though the government insists it would be wrong to expect a private operator to meet an unlimited - and thus uninsurable - cost .
nmp , for its part , says the risks and rewards are reflected in the pricing and fee structure .
indeed , if nmp 's efforts to change the way sellafield 's workforce operates fails to deliver savings , it will not get paid at all , mr hudson points out .
" if the efficiencies do n't create any fees , they wo n't get it . "
improving industrial relations at the site will therefore be among the first challenges awaiting the new management team .
industrial relations a strike over pay was only just averted in the run-up to the handover , and many on site are apprehensive about their new bosses ' arrival .
it will be nmp 's job to inspire their work ethics while at the same time increase productivity .
part of that process will be to offer them hope of lifelong careers .
" we are on the verge of a global nuclear renaissance and , in the not too distant future the uk government will make some key decisions on potential new nuclear missions , " says mr pedde .
" i want to make sure that sellafield sites and the workforce are in a position to seize whatever potential opportunities these decisions may bring , collectively and as individuals . "

advertisement how to dismantle sellafield - a day with the plant 's decommissioning manager in a grand old house on the outskirts of whitehaven in cumbria , a small team of international managers are preparing to take on the task of cleaning up the most intricate nuclear complex in the world .
nuclear management partners -lrb- nmp -rrb- - a consortium representing companies from the us , france and the uk - has been awarded a multi-billion pound contract that could turn into the biggest procurement deal ever signed by the uk government .
nuclear management partners are taking charge of sellafield the task ahead : to sort out the mess left behind after more than half a century of nuclear energy and weapons production at sellafield .
" we want to make a difference , " says nmp 's managing director bob pedde .
" we are committed to reducing site hazards cost-effectively , through clean-up and decommissioning , while maximizing commercial value . "
nmp 's appointment marks the end of british nuclear fuels , better known as bnfl , the monolithic government body that for years was synonymous with the uk nuclear industry .
big clean-up bill currently , neither weapons nor electricity is produced at the sellafield site , though income is earned from reprocessing spent nuclear fuel .
that income partially subsidises the main job at hand , namely the decommissioning of the old nuclear fuel reprocessing plants and nuclear power generators - including the world 's first commercial nuclear power plant , calder hall .
sellafield 's skyline is slowly changing it is just the first in a series of clean-ups of decommissioned nuclear power stations across britain , which could cost between £ 72bn and £ 100bn and take several deades to complete .
most of the uk-wide nuclear cleanup bill will be paid for by tax payers through the government agency nuclear decommissioning authority -lrb- nda -rrb- , which owns the sites .
environmental restoration much has already happened at the sprawling sellafield site .
nuclear management partners urs washington , areva and amec make up the consortium it takes over the management of sellafield on monday 24 november 2008 the contract to dismantle old nuclear power and reprocessing plants lasts five years but could be extended to 17 years the decommissioning costs £ 1.3bn per year to make profits , nmp will have to improve working practices to make savings the company says jobs are safe the distinct cooling towers have been demolished and other high-rise buildings are slowly being picked apart - in some cases , brick by brick - gradually changing the site 's famous skyline .
" sellafield is an environmental restoration project " , insists ian hudson , sellafield programme director at the nda .
these days , much of the work is being carried out by contractors .
nma 's arrival completes a gradual shift from the state to the private sector .
" what people have n't cottoned on to is this huge cultural change in the nuclear industry , " says mr hudson .
taking charge back in nmp 's offices , the light , modern furniture looks out of place in the traditional surroundings .
the shelves contain little other than a few folders .
a few bags of corporate christmas presents are stashed in a corner .
but nmp 's mr pedde will be gone long before christmas .
decommission work is tough and can be dangerous he and his directors are relocating to considerably grittier surroundings at sellafield , where they will replace the current management team and take charge of a 10,000 strong workforce , plus some 2,000 contractors .
the work is challenging , not least because buildings and structures can not simply be demolished until contaminated concrete and other materials have been safely removed .
making matters even trickier is the way age and exposure to acids used to reprocess spent fuel are causing the buildings to crumble .
in many cases buildings and other structures must be strengthened before decommissioning work can start .
long term commitment the decommissioning agency has initially signed up nmp for five years , though the initial £ 6.5bn contract might be extended until 2030 .
the sellafield site is complex and hazardous " the contract is designed to last for 17 years in five-year increments and we intend to be there for the long-term , " says mr pedde .
under the deal , the consortium - which is made up of urs washington from the us , areva from france and amec from the uk - will take over bnfl 's share of and run sellafield ltd .
hence , it is sellafield ltd that will receive the money to pay for the gradual dismantling and clean-up of the facilities on the sellafield , calder hall , windscale and capenhurst sites .
savings from improved working practices will go into a " fee pool " that will be controlled by the nda .
the pool will be used to pay the consortium a fee , based on a broad range of performance targets ranging from training initiatives for staff to safety .
" we incentivise not only what they do but also how they do it , " explains the nda 's mr hudson .
" while it 's a private company , we still have to maintain what the government expects a public body to be . "
the project does not guarantee nmp a profit , though .
to make money , the private management company will have to improve efficiency at the site .
" there is an excellent workforce here .
we are looking forward to partnering them , listening to them and getting their input to discuss what we can do together to maximise efficiencies , " says mr pedde .
" this is not about cutting jobs , it is about maximising the skills at sellafield .
there is more work than this workforce can do in the lifetime plan -lsb- for the site -rsb- . "
no gain , no pay with regards to on-site safety , the consortium and its parent companies ' liability is limited , similar to how the fee structure works , explains mr hudson .
contamination must be removed before the buildings are demolished so if something goes wrong the private operator will only carry the can up to a point , with the government stepping in to bear the bulk of the burden should there be a major disaster .
the indemnity has been controversial , though the government insists it would be wrong to expect a private operator to meet an unlimited - and thus uninsurable - cost .
nmp , for its part , says the risks and rewards are reflected in the pricing and fee structure .
indeed , if nmp 's efforts to change the way sellafield 's workforce operates fails to deliver savings , it will not get paid at all , mr hudson points out .
" if the efficiencies do n't create any fees , they wo n't get it . "
improving industrial relations at the site will therefore be among the first challenges awaiting the new management team .
industrial relations a strike over pay was only just averted in the run-up to the handover , and many on site are apprehensive about their new bosses ' arrival .
it will be nmp 's job to inspire their work ethics while at the same time increase productivity .
part of that process will be to offer them hope of lifelong careers .
" we are on the verge of a global nuclear renaissance and , in the not too distant future the uk government will make some key decisions on potential new nuclear missions , " says mr pedde .
" i want to make sure that sellafield sites and the workforce are in a position to seize whatever potential opportunities these decisions may bring , collectively and as individuals . "

" while it 's a private company , we still have to maintain what the government expects a public body to be . "
the project does not guarantee nmp a profit , though .
to make money , the private management company will have to improve efficiency at the site .
" there is an excellent workforce here .
we are looking forward to partnering them , listening to them and getting their input to discuss what we can do together to maximise efficiencies , " says mr pedde .
" this is not about cutting jobs , it is about maximising the skills at sellafield .
there is more work than this workforce can do in the lifetime plan -lsb- for the site -rsb- . "
no gain , no pay with regards to on-site safety , the consortium and its parent companies ' liability is limited , similar to how the fee structure works , explains mr hudson .
so if something goes wrong the private operator will only carry the can up to a point , with the government stepping in to bear the bulk of the burden should there be a major disaster .
the indemnity has been controversial , though the government insists it would be wrong to expect a private operator to meet an unlimited - and thus uninsurable - cost .
nmp , for its part , says the risks and rewards are reflected in the pricing and fee structure .
indeed , if nmp 's efforts to change the way sellafield 's workforce operates fails to deliver savings , it will not get paid at all , mr hudson points out .
" if the efficiencies do n't create any fees , they wo n't get it . "
improving industrial relations at the site will therefore be among the first challenges awaiting the new management team .
industrial relations a strike over pay was only just averted in the run-up to the handover , and many on site are apprehensive about their new bosses ' arrival .
it will be nmp 's job to inspire their work ethics while at the same time increase productivity .
part of that process will be to offer them hope of lifelong careers .
" we are on the verge of a global nuclear renaissance and , in the not too distant future the uk government will make some key decisions on potential new nuclear missions , " says mr pedde .
" i want to make sure that sellafield sites and the workforce are in a position to seize whatever potential opportunities these decisions may bring , collectively and as individuals . "

the project in holland-on-sea was approved by the environment agency after a successful tendring district council bid for a government grant .
the work involves replacing the sea wall and adding a new beach access ramp in the hazelmere road area .
the lower promenade will be closed to the public until the work is completed by easter 2009 .
last year the council carried out emergency works costing £ 400,000 after another part of the sea wall in the town collapsed .
councillor harry shearing said that while the work was important to the sea defences along that particular stretch of coast , it was not a long term solution to the problems along the coastline .
" what is required is a comprehensive major scheme such as the £ 24m project put to defra in 2004 , " he said .
" we will carry on the fight for cash with our residents ... in the meantime i am delighted that this work at hazelmere road is set to begin and help prevent further collapse of the wall at what is a very vulnerable location . "

in this series we pluck a pledge from the archives .
and see what happened next ...
job centres have become more hi-tech in recent years six years ago gordon brown declared war on " unemployability " .
in a speech in birmingham the then chancellor promised a " street-by-street , estate-by-estate " effort to bring the long-term jobless into work .
part of this would involve mobile job centres touring unemployment blackspots , alerting people to the vacancies and offering advice .
mr brown drew attention to tottenham , in north london , where there were 3,500 men were out of work , alongside more than 4,000 registered vacancies .
' destructive culture ' he told the government 's urban summit on 1 november 2002 : " this will be an onslaught against the unacceptable culture of worklessness that grew up in some of our communities in the 1980s and early 1990s .
" because we must break the destructive culture that ' no one around here works ' , we will extend access to the help available through the new deal in those areas .
" but in exchange we will expect the unemployed to take up the jobs that are available . "
if you have a vehicle that pulls up in your area , which could have a level of stigma attached - a bit like a soup kitchen - people tend not to go into it andrew george , lib dem mp conservative work and pensions spokesman david willetts dismissed the whole series of announcements as " one more bogus crackdown on the workshy " .
however , the " street-by-street " attack on the benefits culture was all over the press .
mobile job centres had already been tried in high-unemployment areas of eastern germany , shortly after the reunification of the country in 1990 .
but did they ever take to roads across england ?
it seems not .
when asked about mobile job centres by the bbc , a department for work and pensions spokeswoman did not offer a specific comment on them .
she said : " action teams and ethnic minority outreach initiatives were set up in 2002 and together achieved their key goal of helping over 150,000 people in some of our most deprived communities to move into work .
" having achieved this we wanted to further direct our cash to help those most in need and so we replaced action teams with a new scheme called the deprived areas fund , which pinpoints areas of deprivation and provides help and support to those communities . "
' full potential ' the £ 65m deprived areas fund was announced by the then work and pensions secretary john hutton in june last year .
mr hutton , coincidentally speaking in birmingham like mr brown had five years earlier , said : " we need to develop the right framework to encourage and reward investment and improved performance .
" and we should draw on the full potential of private and voluntary providers - especially the expertise of local organisations to innovate and develop solutions tailored to their local area . "
there appears to have been no mention of men and women in vans travelling to estates , disseminating advice and alerting people to job vacancies .
mobile job centres have been largely forgotten .
the public and commercial services union argues that the plan was never likely to work anyway .
the important thing is to get trained staff to people and advise theme keith wylie , pcs union it says the scheme was never viable after the government announced in 2004 that it intended to cut 30,000 staff in job centres and benefits offices by 2008 .
the union 's work and pensions spokesman , keith wylie , said : " unemployment can be patchy , both by region and by locations within regions .
" it can be high on one estate and much lower on the next .
i do n't think the government ever really did much about using mobile job centres to target problem areas .
" their policy did the opposite .
they made it a priority to axe small job centres and concentrate services in larger offices .
without the smaller centres it is harder for people to access the jobs .
" the important thing is to get trained staff to people and advise them .
with the cuts , job centre employees are under huge strain .
we could have three million people unemployed by christmas , so the need for something is even huger now . "
supermarket screens job centres nowadays use touch-screen computers , rather than cards on boards , to guide people towards vacancies .
under its " outreach " efforts , the government has installed terminals in other public buildings , such as libraries and supermarkets .
mr wylie said : " it is important to get to people .
the problem is that some of the poorest people , who come from a home without a computer , have problems with the level of it literacy needed to operate the screens .
" what they need , if they are using these devices , is someone with them who is trained to help . "
liberal democrat mp andrew george , who has campaigned against the closure of job centres in his st ives seat in cornwall , is not convinced that mobile job centres in vans could ever have worked .
post offices he said : " if you have a vehicle that pulls up in your area , which could have a level of stigma attached - a bit like a soup kitchen - people tend not to go into it even if the service provided is something they need .
" they prefer to go somewhere more anonymous .
rather than send in vans , there should be more use made of post offices to provide these kinds of services .
" i think that the government wanted to sound like something proactive and important was happening , but that this had n't been terribly well thought through . "
there is some good news for advocates of mobile job centres , though , albeit a little further from home .
a scheme has been set up to deal with regional unemployment variations in the former soviet republic of kyrgyzstan .
for work-seekers wanting a mobile job centre to pull up outside their house , getting on a bike - or a plane - and moving 3,500 miles east is probably the best bet .

when asked about mobile job centres by the bbc , a department for work and pensions spokeswoman did not offer a specific comment on them .
she said : " action teams and ethnic minority outreach initiatives were set up in 2002 and together achieved their key goal of helping over 150,000 people in some of our most deprived communities to move into work .
" having achieved this we wanted to further direct our cash to help those most in need and so we replaced action teams with a new scheme called the deprived areas fund , which pinpoints areas of deprivation and provides help and support to those communities . "
' full potential ' the £ 65m deprived areas fund was announced by the then work and pensions secretary john hutton in june last year .
mr hutton , coincidentally speaking in birmingham like mr brown had five years earlier , said : " we need to develop the right framework to encourage and reward investment and improved performance .
" and we should draw on the full potential of private and voluntary providers - especially the expertise of local organisations to innovate and develop solutions tailored to their local area . "
there appears to have been no mention of men and women in vans travelling to estates , disseminating advice and alerting people to job vacancies .
mobile job centres have been largely forgotten .
the public and commercial services union argues that the plan was never likely to work anyway .
the important thing is to get trained staff to people and advise theme keith wylie , pcs union it says the scheme was never viable after the government announced in 2004 that it intended to cut 30,000 staff in job centres and benefits offices by 2008 .
the union 's work and pensions spokesman , keith wylie , said : " unemployment can be patchy , both by region and by locations within regions .
" it can be high on one estate and much lower on the next .
i do n't think the government ever really did much about using mobile job centres to target problem areas .
" their policy did the opposite .
they made it a priority to axe small job centres and concentrate services in larger offices .
without the smaller centres it is harder for people to access the jobs .
" the important thing is to get trained staff to people and advise them .
with the cuts , job centre employees are under huge strain .
we could have three million people unemployed by christmas , so the need for something is even huger now . "
supermarket screens job centres nowadays use touch-screen computers , rather than cards on boards , to guide people towards vacancies .
under its " outreach " efforts , the government has installed terminals in other public buildings , such as libraries and supermarkets .
mr wylie said : " it is important to get to people .
the problem is that some of the poorest people , who come from a home without a computer , have problems with the level of it literacy needed to operate the screens .
" what they need , if they are using these devices , is someone with them who is trained to help . "
liberal democrat mp andrew george , who has campaigned against the closure of job centres in his st ives seat in cornwall , is not convinced that mobile job centres in vans could ever have worked .
post offices he said : " if you have a vehicle that pulls up in your area , which could have a level of stigma attached - a bit like a soup kitchen - people tend not to go into it even if the service provided is something they need .
" they prefer to go somewhere more anonymous .
rather than send in vans , there should be more use made of post offices to provide these kinds of services .
" i think that the government wanted to sound like something proactive and important was happening , but that this had n't been terribly well thought through . "
there is some good news for advocates of mobile job centres , though , albeit a little further from home .
a scheme has been set up to deal with regional unemployment variations in the former soviet republic of kyrgyzstan .
for work-seekers wanting a mobile job centre to pull up outside their house , getting on a bike - or a plane - and moving 3,500 miles east is probably the best bet .

job centres have become more hi-tech in recent years six years ago gordon brown declared war on " unemployability " .
in a speech in birmingham the then chancellor promised a " street-by-street , estate-by-estate " effort to bring the long-term jobless into work .
part of this would involve mobile job centres touring unemployment blackspots , alerting people to the vacancies and offering advice .
mr brown drew attention to tottenham , in north london , where there were 3,500 men were out of work , alongside more than 4,000 registered vacancies .
' destructive culture ' he told the government 's urban summit on 1 november 2002 : " this will be an onslaught against the unacceptable culture of worklessness that grew up in some of our communities in the 1980s and early 1990s .
" because we must break the destructive culture that ' no one around here works ' , we will extend access to the help available through the new deal in those areas .
" but in exchange we will expect the unemployed to take up the jobs that are available . "
if you have a vehicle that pulls up in your area , which could have a level of stigma attached - a bit like a soup kitchen - people tend not to go into it andrew george , lib dem mp conservative work and pensions spokesman david willetts dismissed the whole series of announcements as " one more bogus crackdown on the workshy " .
however , the " street-by-street " attack on the benefits culture was all over the press .

in this series we pluck a pledge from the archives .
and see what happened next ...
six years ago gordon brown declared war on " unemployability " .
in a speech in birmingham the then chancellor promised a " street-by-street , estate-by-estate " effort to bring the long-term jobless into work .
part of this would involve mobile job centres touring unemployment blackspots , alerting people to the vacancies and offering advice .
mr brown drew attention to tottenham , in north london , where there were 3,500 men were out of work , alongside more than 4,000 registered vacancies .
' destructive culture ' he told the government 's urban summit on 1 november 2002 : " this will be an onslaught against the unacceptable culture of worklessness that grew up in some of our communities in the 1980s and early 1990s .
" because we must break the destructive culture that ' no one around here works ' , we will extend access to the help available through the new deal in those areas .
" but in exchange we will expect the unemployed to take up the jobs that are available . "
" if you have a vehicle that pulls up in your area , which could have a level of stigma attached - a bit like a soup kitchen - people tend not to go into it " andrew george , lib dem mp conservative work and pensions spokesman david willetts dismissed the whole series of announcements as " one more bogus crackdown on the workshy " .
however , the " street-by-street " attack on the benefits culture was all over the press .
mobile job centres had already been tried in high-unemployment areas of eastern germany , shortly after the reunification of the country in 1990 .
but did they ever take to roads across england ?
it seems not .
when asked about mobile job centres by the bbc , a department for work and pensions spokeswoman did not offer a specific comment on them .
she said : " action teams and ethnic minority outreach initiatives were set up in 2002 and together achieved their key goal of helping over 150,000 people in some of our most deprived communities to move into work .
" having achieved this we wanted to further direct our cash to help those most in need and so we replaced action teams with a new scheme called the deprived areas fund , which pinpoints areas of deprivation and provides help and support to those communities . "
' full potential ' the £ 65m deprived areas fund was announced by the then work and pensions secretary john hutton in june last year .
mr hutton , coincidentally speaking in birmingham like mr brown had five years earlier , said : " we need to develop the right framework to encourage and reward investment and improved performance .
" and we should draw on the full potential of private and voluntary providers - especially the expertise of local organisations to innovate and develop solutions tailored to their local area . "
there appears to have been no mention of men and women in vans travelling to estates , disseminating advice and alerting people to job vacancies .
mobile job centres have been largely forgotten .
the public and commercial services union argues that the plan was never likely to work anyway . "
the important thing is to get trained staff to people and advise theme " keith wylie , pcs union it says the scheme was never viable after the government announced in 2004 that it intended to cut 30,000 staff in job centres and benefits offices by 2008 .
the union 's work and pensions spokesman , keith wylie , said : " unemployment can be patchy , both by region and by locations within regions .
" it can be high on one estate and much lower on the next .
i do n't think the government ever really did much about using mobile job centres to target problem areas .
" their policy did the opposite .
they made it a priority to axe small job centres and concentrate services in larger offices .
without the smaller centres it is harder for people to access the jobs .
" the important thing is to get trained staff to people and advise them .
with the cuts , job centre employees are under huge strain .
we could have three million people unemployed by christmas , so the need for something is even huger now . "
supermarket screens job centres nowadays use touch-screen computers , rather than cards on boards , to guide people towards vacancies .
under its " outreach " efforts , the government has installed terminals in other public buildings , such as libraries and supermarkets .
mr wylie said : " it is important to get to people .
the problem is that some of the poorest people , who come from a home without a computer , have problems with the level of it literacy needed to operate the screens .
" what they need , if they are using these devices , is someone with them who is trained to help . "
liberal democrat mp andrew george , who has campaigned against the closure of job centres in his st ives seat in cornwall , is not convinced that mobile job centres in vans could ever have worked .
post offices he said : " if you have a vehicle that pulls up in your area , which could have a level of stigma attached - a bit like a soup kitchen - people tend not to go into it even if the service provided is something they need .
" they prefer to go somewhere more anonymous .
rather than send in vans , there should be more use made of post offices to provide these kinds of services .
" i think that the government wanted to sound like something proactive and important was happening , but that this had n't been terribly well thought through . "
there is some good news for advocates of mobile job centres , though , albeit a little further from home .
a scheme has been set up to deal with regional unemployment variations in the former soviet republic of kyrgyzstan .
for work-seekers wanting a mobile job centre to pull up outside their house , getting on a bike - or a plane - and moving 3,500 miles east is probably the best bet .
