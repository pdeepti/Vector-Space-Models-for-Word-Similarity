" basically no one is 100 percent satisfied with this ball , " andreas koepke , germany 's goalkeeper-coach told reporters at the german base camp in tenero , switzerland , on saturday , june 7 .
germany goalkeeper jens lehmann had repeatedly complained that it was difficult to catch and had a tendency to swirl .
co-host austria 's goalkeeper alexander manninger and czech goalie petr cech also expressed their dissatisfaction with the fast ball which is likely to make a goalkeeper 's life very difficult during the three-week tournament .
" this ball is not the keeper 's friend , " manninger said .
players however may see things a little different .
outfield stars eager to get to grips with europass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " look out lads , that thing could go anywhere " " for players , the ball is great , " germany midfielder thorsten frings said .
" there will be many more goals from a greater distance .
if you hit it right , it really goes off . "
yes , for keepers the ball presented a difficulty , frings admitted , but " we 'll get this sorted , " he said optimistically .
one thing field players and goalkeepers seem to agree on : the europass may change the way the game is played at this tournament .
" you have to be more awake with this ball , " koepke said .
the defense , for one , had to be more on the ball - so to speak .
as keepers were more likely to avoid the risk of catching this ball and will rather block it , defenders will have to be fully alert in those potentially risky situations and try to get the ball before the other team 's forwards , he explained .
at the same time , the forwards would of course try and get in their second chance .
germany 's goalies ready to face " tricky customer " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one minute it was there , coach , the next it was n't " using the europass brought some changes for training germany 's goalkeepers , koepke said .
field players were included in goalkeeper training routines to help the keepers adjust to the ball 's properties .
" it is pointless to lament this , " koepke said , adding that his team had tried to make the best of it .
" -lrb- but -rrb- i do n't think we will get more goals because the ball swirls , " koepke said .
adidas , which worked two years on the development of the ball , did not see such problems .
" the ball 's new surface structure allows players to control and direct it perfectly in all weather conditions , " the company said at the ball 's presentation .
its new surface texture on the outer skin guaranteed " optimum grip between ball and boot , " as well as better grip between glove and ball for goalkeepers . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we go into this game confident , full of belief and with a certain degree of boldness , " loew told a news conference after the team 's arrival in the austrian host city of klagenfurt .
germany meet poland on sunday , june 8 .
midfielder torsten frings shared the optimism , saying ahead of the departure from the team 's swiss base camp : " we really believe that we can win the title .
if not we should n't be here . "
germany have not won a euro match since the 1996 final , which adds spice for loew in his biggest match to date as head coach since being promoted from assistant as successor to juergen klinsmann after the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain keep their cards close to their chests but the coach was upbeat that victory will finally come again after six winless matches in first-round exits in 2000 and 2004 .
" we want to end this series as soon as possible , ” loew said .
" i believe that we have a team that is capable of winning this first match .
if we perform to our capabilities then we will have a team that will take charge and dictate the rhythm . "
loew refused to reveal his starting lineup as some uncertainty remains around bayern munich players bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
all that loew was prepared to say was that " schweinsteiger has improved compared to the beginning of the week . "
gomez rumored to partner klose up front it appears that podolski will get the nod on the left wing instead of schweinsteiger and that vfb stuttgart 's high-scoring mario gomez will partner munich 's miroslav klose up front .
this lineup , which features captain michael ballack and frings as key midfielders , only underlines that germany are out to attack from the outset and to spare themselves the nerves they suffered at the world cup two years ago when they required an injury-time winner from oliver neuville to beat the poles .
a good win would also send a clear warning to the other group opponents austria and croatia , and to the other teams as well - looking ahead to the june 29 final in vienna .
loew ultimately has his sights set on the title but also warned that " it is the toughest tournament in the world " with little separating the teams .
loew calls on germany 's twelfth man germany held their final training session later behind closed doors , but loew had earlier appealed to the german fans in an open letter published in several german dailies .
bildunterschrift : germany 's twelfth man : the fans " our team does n't end with the shirt number 23 .
the millions of german fans are also part of it .
we saw at the summer fairy tale 2006 -lrb- germany 's run to third place at the world cup -rrb- what can be possible with enthusiasm and big support , " said loew .
" the euro title must not remain a dream if everyone involved seeks one common goal , ” he added .
" our mountain tour in the alpine countries of austria and switzerland is going to have a happy ending - on june 29 in the vienna final . ”
polish-born strikers germany 's main weapon loew will be hoping polish-born striker klose will be germany ’ s main weapon in that quest . the bayern munich striker , who was born in oppeln , poland , was top scorer at the 2006 world cup and after winning germany 's domestic treble last season he wants to translate domestic success to the european stage . with 39 goals and 75 caps , klose will turn 30 on monday with loew insisting he is in the form of his life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been in consistently good form for germany " miroslav has left a fantastic impression in training , i have never seen him that fit , that agile and strong , " said loew .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 08.06.2008 germany enter euro 2008 campaign with confidence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany coach joachim loew has been keeping his team 's preparations under wraps germany will enter their first euro 2008 match against poland determined to make an impression , coach joachim loew said ahead of the group b clash . " we go into this game confident , full of belief and with a certain degree of boldness , " loew told a news conference after the team 's arrival in the austrian host city of klagenfurt .
germany meet poland on sunday , june 8 .
midfielder torsten frings shared the optimism , saying ahead of the departure from the team 's swiss base camp : " we really believe that we can win the title .
if not we should n't be here . "
germany have not won a euro match since the 1996 final , which adds spice for loew in his biggest match to date as head coach since being promoted from assistant as successor to juergen klinsmann after the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain keep their cards close to their chests but the coach was upbeat that victory will finally come again after six winless matches in first-round exits in 2000 and 2004 .
" we want to end this series as soon as possible , ” loew said .
" i believe that we have a team that is capable of winning this first match .
if we perform to our capabilities then we will have a team that will take charge and dictate the rhythm . "
loew refused to reveal his starting lineup as some uncertainty remains around bayern munich players bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
all that loew was prepared to say was that " schweinsteiger has improved compared to the beginning of the week . "
gomez rumored to partner klose up front it appears that podolski will get the nod on the left wing instead of schweinsteiger and that vfb stuttgart 's high-scoring mario gomez will partner munich 's miroslav klose up front .
this lineup , which features captain michael ballack and frings as key midfielders , only underlines that germany are out to attack from the outset and to spare themselves the nerves they suffered at the world cup two years ago when they required an injury-time winner from oliver neuville to beat the poles .
a good win would also send a clear warning to the other group opponents austria and croatia , and to the other teams as well - looking ahead to the june 29 final in vienna .
loew ultimately has his sights set on the title but also warned that " it is the toughest tournament in the world " with little separating the teams .
loew calls on germany 's twelfth man germany held their final training session later behind closed doors , but loew had earlier appealed to the german fans in an open letter published in several german dailies .
bildunterschrift : germany 's twelfth man : the fans " our team does n't end with the shirt number 23 .
the millions of german fans are also part of it .
we saw at the summer fairy tale 2006 -lrb- germany 's run to third place at the world cup -rrb- what can be possible with enthusiasm and big support , " said loew .
" the euro title must not remain a dream if everyone involved seeks one common goal , ” he added .
" our mountain tour in the alpine countries of austria and switzerland is going to have a happy ending - on june 29 in the vienna final . ”
polish-born strikers germany 's main weapon loew will be hoping polish-born striker klose will be germany ’ s main weapon in that quest . the bayern munich striker , who was born in oppeln , poland , was top scorer at the 2006 world cup and after winning germany 's domestic treble last season he wants to translate domestic success to the european stage . with 39 goals and 75 caps , klose will turn 30 on monday with loew insisting he is in the form of his life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been in consistently good form for germany " miroslav has left a fantastic impression in training , i have never seen him that fit , that agile and strong , " said loew .
" the way he moves in training , you could see his old dynamic self coming back . " podolski , germany ’ s other polish-born striker , said he would treat sunday 's game against poland with the same fierce desire to see his side win in style . the 23-year-old speaks fluent polish and has been helping his team-mates pronounce the names of the opponents they will face in klagenfurt . poldi the polish spy the bayern munich striker still has relatives in poland and watches polish television at home , but he is keeping his fingers crossed that germany coach joachim loew will name him in the starting line-up to add to his 48 caps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi hopes to silence his doubters " things are going well and i am training as if i will be playing ; i 'll find out tomorrow or the day after if i am starting , " said podolski , who has been used as an attacking midfielder by loew in the past . " poland are a compact team with a good coach , but if we play at 100 percent and work hard i am sure we will win , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany meet poland on sunday , june 8 .
midfielder torsten frings shared the optimism , saying ahead of the departure from the team 's swiss base camp : " we really believe that we can win the title .
if not we should n't be here . "
germany have not won a euro match since the 1996 final , which adds spice for loew in his biggest match to date as head coach since being promoted from assistant as successor to juergen klinsmann after the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain keep their cards close to their chests but the coach was upbeat that victory will finally come again after six winless matches in first-round exits in 2000 and 2004 .

" i believe that we have a team that is capable of winning this first match .
if we perform to our capabilities then we will have a team that will take charge and dictate the rhythm . "

that 's a very dangerous tendency , " she added .
statistics collected by the moscow center for human rights indicate that 72 people were killed in connection with racist attacks in the first five months of this year , compared to a total of 50 in 2007 .
center head alexander brod said that there were 126 attacks in total - with 137 injuries also occurring in the course of the violence .
the majority of the incidents took place in moscow and st. petersburg .

citizens from these countries also accounted for a large number of the injuries with 23 tajiks , 10 uzbeks and five people from kyrgyzstan being harmed in racially motivated attacks .

the 8 percent increase marked the biggest ever one-day surge . " if we leave this situation as it is , it could lead to a recession of the world economy , " japan 's energy minister akira amari said on sunday in an opening address .
" ensuring energy security , including stability of the oil market , has become one of the top priorities for every country . " climate change linked to energy amari said the 11 countries meeting in aomori together consume 65 percent of the world 's energy and release 65 percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions . " climate change and energy issues are two sides of the same coin , " he said .
" it is indispensible to solve these problems together . " the participants pledged to launch 20 test projects by 2010 on so-called carbon capture and storage , which involves catching carbon emissions from power plants and injecting them into underground storage areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to phase out nuclear power , but not all g8 powers agree while the technology for carbon capture and storage is not yet fully developed and remains hotly disputed , advocates say it could allow the earth 's abundant supply of coal to be processed without polluting the environment . nuclear energy remains a divider differences of opinion among the participants on the expansion of nuclear energy were not bridged at sunday 's conference . " i think we 're on the verge of a new nuclear age and that will be a positive thing for the world , " said john hutton , british secretary of state for business enterprise and regulatory reform . however , germany 's economics minister , jochen homann , said berlin would stick by its plan to phase out nuclear power completely by 2020 . more efficiency , not more oil nevertheless , the participants seemed in agreement that increasing energy efficiency and investing in alternative technologies , including carbon storage , were essential to taming energy prices . " -lsb- on -rsb- energy efficiency , and energy diversification , we all recognize that tremendous progress has been made but more has to be done , " said gary lunn , canada 's natural resources minister . europe , japan and the us have already discussed the possibility of setting up a framework for exchanging information on energy-saving , called the international partnership for energy efficiency cooperation -lrb- ipeec -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was a very important goal for me , " said pepe .
" i love playing for my country and am delighted that everything went so well for us . " portugal 's only real concern would be that they did not win more comprehensively . no distractions for ronaldo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal fans had a reason to celebrate ronaldo was spasmodically exciting , but the real pluses were deco and joao mouninho , who dominated the center of midfield despite their lack of height . there was a thought that the manchester united winger might be distracted by the ongoing speculation over his future , but portugal coach luiz felipe scolari insisted that he had seen no signs of a diminished performance . " the first 30 minutes of cristiano ronaldo were the normal 30 minutes from him , " the brazilian said . " when turkey play against a great squad like ours , they try to stop them playing the way they want to play .
we expected cristiano to play like he did . " significantly , when nuno gomes came off after 69 minutes , it was to ronaldo that he handed the captain 's armband . " i did that to give him more strength and motivation , " scolari said . real start to euro 2008 petit had a goal ruled out for a marginal offside on 17 minutes , then ronaldo drew a superb fingertip save from demirel as he tipped his trademark free-kick against the upright . gokhan zan then made a fine block to deny moutinho after he had been laid in by deco . the barrage continued after half-time .
gokhan was guilty of an awful foul on simao sabrosa , but as the ball broke to nuno gomes , referee herbert fandel allowed play to continue , only for the forward to jab his shot against the post . the goal settled portugal , but it did n't bring them any great fortune , and nuno gomes again hit the bar with a looping header from a ronaldo cross . the margin may have been the same as the czech republic achieved against hosts switzerland earlier in the day , but this was a far more impressive performance . after a rather bitty first game , this was the match that got the tournament rolling , and portugal did more than enough to justify their position as overwhelming favorites to win the group . # b # dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" basically no one is 100 percent satisfied with this ball , " andreas koepke , germany 's goalkeeper-coach told reporters at the german base camp in tenero , switzerland , on saturday , june 7 .
germany goalkeeper jens lehmann had repeatedly complained that it was difficult to catch and had a tendency to swirl .
co-host austria 's goalkeeper alexander manninger and czech goalie petr cech also expressed their dissatisfaction with the fast ball which is likely to make a goalkeeper 's life very difficult during the three-week tournament .
" this ball is not the keeper 's friend , " manninger said .
players however may see things a little different .
outfield stars eager to get to grips with europass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " look out lads , that thing could go anywhere " " for players , the ball is great , " germany midfielder thorsten frings said .
" there will be many more goals from a greater distance .
if you hit it right , it really goes off . "
yes , for keepers the ball presented a difficulty , frings admitted , but " we 'll get this sorted , " he said optimistically .
one thing field players and goalkeepers seem to agree on : the europass may change the way the game is played at this tournament .
" you have to be more awake with this ball , " koepke said .
the defense , for one , had to be more on the ball - so to speak .
as keepers were more likely to avoid the risk of catching this ball and will rather block it , defenders will have to be fully alert in those potentially risky situations and try to get the ball before the other team 's forwards , he explained .
at the same time , the forwards would of course try and get in their second chance .
germany 's goalies ready to face " tricky customer " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one minute it was there , coach , the next it was n't " using the europass brought some changes for training germany 's goalkeepers , koepke said .
field players were included in goalkeeper training routines to help the keepers adjust to the ball 's properties .
" it is pointless to lament this , " koepke said , adding that his team had tried to make the best of it .
" -lrb- but -rrb- i do n't think we will get more goals because the ball swirls , " koepke said .
adidas , which worked two years on the development of the ball , did not see such problems .
" the ball 's new surface structure allows players to control and direct it perfectly in all weather conditions , " the company said at the ball 's presentation .
its new surface texture on the outer skin guaranteed " optimum grip between ball and boot , " as well as better grip between glove and ball for goalkeepers . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" basically no one is 100 percent satisfied with this ball , " andreas koepke , germany 's goalkeeper-coach told reporters at the german base camp in tenero , switzerland , on saturday , june 7 .
germany goalkeeper jens lehmann had repeatedly complained that it was difficult to catch and had a tendency to swirl .
co-host austria 's goalkeeper alexander manninger and czech goalie petr cech also expressed their dissatisfaction with the fast ball which is likely to make a goalkeeper 's life very difficult during the three-week tournament .
" this ball is not the keeper 's friend , " manninger said .
players however may see things a little different .

the defense , for one , had to be more on the ball - so to speak .
as keepers were more likely to avoid the risk of catching this ball and will rather block it , defenders will have to be fully alert in those potentially risky situations and try to get the ball before the other team 's forwards , he explained .
at the same time , the forwards would of course try and get in their second chance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 08.06.2008 germany enter euro 2008 campaign with confidence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany coach joachim loew has been keeping his team 's preparations under wraps germany will enter their first euro 2008 match against poland determined to make an impression , coach joachim loew said ahead of the group b clash . " we go into this game confident , full of belief and with a certain degree of boldness , " loew told a news conference after the team 's arrival in the austrian host city of klagenfurt .
germany meet poland on sunday , june 8 .
midfielder torsten frings shared the optimism , saying ahead of the departure from the team 's swiss base camp : " we really believe that we can win the title .
if not we should n't be here . "
germany have not won a euro match since the 1996 final , which adds spice for loew in his biggest match to date as head coach since being promoted from assistant as successor to juergen klinsmann after the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain keep their cards close to their chests but the coach was upbeat that victory will finally come again after six winless matches in first-round exits in 2000 and 2004 .
" we want to end this series as soon as possible , ” loew said .
" i believe that we have a team that is capable of winning this first match .
if we perform to our capabilities then we will have a team that will take charge and dictate the rhythm . "
loew refused to reveal his starting lineup as some uncertainty remains around bayern munich players bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
all that loew was prepared to say was that " schweinsteiger has improved compared to the beginning of the week . "
gomez rumored to partner klose up front it appears that podolski will get the nod on the left wing instead of schweinsteiger and that vfb stuttgart 's high-scoring mario gomez will partner munich 's miroslav klose up front .
this lineup , which features captain michael ballack and frings as key midfielders , only underlines that germany are out to attack from the outset and to spare themselves the nerves they suffered at the world cup two years ago when they required an injury-time winner from oliver neuville to beat the poles .
a good win would also send a clear warning to the other group opponents austria and croatia , and to the other teams as well - looking ahead to the june 29 final in vienna .
loew ultimately has his sights set on the title but also warned that " it is the toughest tournament in the world " with little separating the teams .
loew calls on germany 's twelfth man germany held their final training session later behind closed doors , but loew had earlier appealed to the german fans in an open letter published in several german dailies .
bildunterschrift : germany 's twelfth man : the fans " our team does n't end with the shirt number 23 .
the millions of german fans are also part of it .
we saw at the summer fairy tale 2006 -lrb- germany 's run to third place at the world cup -rrb- what can be possible with enthusiasm and big support , " said loew .
" the euro title must not remain a dream if everyone involved seeks one common goal , ” he added .
" our mountain tour in the alpine countries of austria and switzerland is going to have a happy ending - on june 29 in the vienna final . ”
polish-born strikers germany 's main weapon loew will be hoping polish-born striker klose will be germany ’ s main weapon in that quest . the bayern munich striker , who was born in oppeln , poland , was top scorer at the 2006 world cup and after winning germany 's domestic treble last season he wants to translate domestic success to the european stage . with 39 goals and 75 caps , klose will turn 30 on monday with loew insisting he is in the form of his life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been in consistently good form for germany " miroslav has left a fantastic impression in training , i have never seen him that fit , that agile and strong , " said loew .
" the way he moves in training , you could see his old dynamic self coming back . " podolski , germany ’ s other polish-born striker , said he would treat sunday 's game against poland with the same fierce desire to see his side win in style . the 23-year-old speaks fluent polish and has been helping his team-mates pronounce the names of the opponents they will face in klagenfurt . poldi the polish spy the bayern munich striker still has relatives in poland and watches polish television at home , but he is keeping his fingers crossed that germany coach joachim loew will name him in the starting line-up to add to his 48 caps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi hopes to silence his doubters " things are going well and i am training as if i will be playing ; i 'll find out tomorrow or the day after if i am starting , " said podolski , who has been used as an attacking midfielder by loew in the past . " poland are a compact team with a good coach , but if we play at 100 percent and work hard i am sure we will win , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" basically no one is 100 percent satisfied with this ball , " andreas koepke , germany 's goalkeeper-coach told reporters at the german base camp in tenero , switzerland , on saturday , june 7 .
germany goalkeeper jens lehmann had repeatedly complained that it was difficult to catch and had a tendency to swirl .
co-host austria 's goalkeeper alexander manninger and czech goalie petr cech also expressed their dissatisfaction with the fast ball which is likely to make a goalkeeper 's life very difficult during the three-week tournament .
" this ball is not the keeper 's friend , " manninger said .
players however may see things a little different .
outfield stars eager to get to grips with europass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " look out lads , that thing could go anywhere " " for players , the ball is great , " germany midfielder thorsten frings said .
" there will be many more goals from a greater distance .
if you hit it right , it really goes off . "
yes , for keepers the ball presented a difficulty , frings admitted , but " we 'll get this sorted , " he said optimistically .
one thing field players and goalkeepers seem to agree on : the europass may change the way the game is played at this tournament .
" you have to be more awake with this ball , " koepke said .
the defense , for one , had to be more on the ball - so to speak .
as keepers were more likely to avoid the risk of catching this ball and will rather block it , defenders will have to be fully alert in those potentially risky situations and try to get the ball before the other team 's forwards , he explained .
at the same time , the forwards would of course try and get in their second chance .
germany 's goalies ready to face " tricky customer " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one minute it was there , coach , the next it was n't " using the europass brought some changes for training germany 's goalkeepers , koepke said .
field players were included in goalkeeper training routines to help the keepers adjust to the ball 's properties .
" it is pointless to lament this , " koepke said , adding that his team had tried to make the best of it .
" -lrb- but -rrb- i do n't think we will get more goals because the ball swirls , " koepke said .
adidas , which worked two years on the development of the ball , did not see such problems .
" the ball 's new surface structure allows players to control and direct it perfectly in all weather conditions , " the company said at the ball 's presentation .
its new surface texture on the outer skin guaranteed " optimum grip between ball and boot , " as well as better grip between glove and ball for goalkeepers . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 08.06.2008 nuclear power returns despite safety scares and opposition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of nuclear reactors is increasing across the globe despite concerns nuclear power is on the advance worldwide , and a recent safety scare in europe is highly unlikely to stop it .
concerns about energy security are driving the renaissance . nearly 440 nuclear reactors churn out electricity across the globe and more than 30 new plants are being built as the world 's energy appetite grows and oil prices soar .
russia , china and india are leading the way in new construction .
in the european union , a push by eastern nations saddled with soviet- era reactors is fuelling tension with anti-nuclear eu nations .
in western europe , the balance is shifting after prime minister silvio berlusconi 's new government said in may it plans to relaunch nuclear power in italy , 21 years after a referendum sparked by the chernobyl disaster outlawed it .
" only a few years ago , supporters of nuclear energy were viewed as witches , " slovakian prime minister robert fico said last month .
" it is clear ... that without nuclear we will be unable to ensure energy security in europe . "
slovakia , one of europe 's fastest-growing economies , is a case in point . under its deal to enter the eu in 2004 , one communist-era reactor at the jaslovske bohunice plant shut down in 2006 and the other is slated to close by 2009 .
to make up the shortfall and feed economic growth , slovakia wants to get two , possibly three , new nuclear plants online over the next few years .
" a war for access to energy sources has started - a war for investment opportunities , " fico said .
nuclear power seen as greener alternative to oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear is seen as the greener alternative to fossil fuels for ex-communist eastern europe , limiting dependence on russian oil and gas is a big factor .
and as eu governments jointly seek to fight global warming , nuclear power is increasingly attractive because it emits almost no greenhouse gases .
france , which gets more than three-quarters of its electricity from nuclear plants , plans to add another one .
finland wants to build a fifth reactor .
bulgaria shut down four of six units at its soviet-era kozloduy plant under pressure from the eu before joining the bloc last year .
but two new reactors are to be finished by 2014 at belene , across the danube river from romania .
energy fears are particularly strong in the baltics .
lithuania 's hefty 1,185-megawatt ignalina plant , which uses a design similar to chernobyl and supplies nearly 70 per cent of the small nation 's electricity , is slated to close by the end of 2009 .

" we go into this game confident , full of belief and with a certain degree of boldness , " loew told a news conference after the team 's arrival in the austrian host city of klagenfurt .
germany meet poland on sunday , june 8 .
midfielder torsten frings shared the optimism , saying ahead of the departure from the team 's swiss base camp : " we really believe that we can win the title .
if not we should n't be here . "
germany have not won a euro match since the 1996 final , which adds spice for loew in his biggest match to date as head coach since being promoted from assistant as successor to juergen klinsmann after the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain keep their cards close to their chests but the coach was upbeat that victory will finally come again after six winless matches in first-round exits in 2000 and 2004 .
" we want to end this series as soon as possible , ” loew said .
" i believe that we have a team that is capable of winning this first match .
if we perform to our capabilities then we will have a team that will take charge and dictate the rhythm . "
loew refused to reveal his starting lineup as some uncertainty remains around bayern munich players bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
all that loew was prepared to say was that " schweinsteiger has improved compared to the beginning of the week . "
gomez rumored to partner klose up front it appears that podolski will get the nod on the left wing instead of schweinsteiger and that vfb stuttgart 's high-scoring mario gomez will partner munich 's miroslav klose up front .
this lineup , which features captain michael ballack and frings as key midfielders , only underlines that germany are out to attack from the outset and to spare themselves the nerves they suffered at the world cup two years ago when they required an injury-time winner from oliver neuville to beat the poles .
a good win would also send a clear warning to the other group opponents austria and croatia , and to the other teams as well - looking ahead to the june 29 final in vienna .
loew ultimately has his sights set on the title but also warned that " it is the toughest tournament in the world " with little separating the teams .
loew calls on germany 's twelfth man germany held their final training session later behind closed doors , but loew had earlier appealed to the german fans in an open letter published in several german dailies .
bildunterschrift : germany 's twelfth man : the fans " our team does n't end with the shirt number 23 .
the millions of german fans are also part of it .
we saw at the summer fairy tale 2006 -lrb- germany 's run to third place at the world cup -rrb- what can be possible with enthusiasm and big support , " said loew .
" the euro title must not remain a dream if everyone involved seeks one common goal , ” he added .
" our mountain tour in the alpine countries of austria and switzerland is going to have a happy ending - on june 29 in the vienna final . ”
polish-born strikers germany 's main weapon loew will be hoping polish-born striker klose will be germany ’ s main weapon in that quest . the bayern munich striker , who was born in oppeln , poland , was top scorer at the 2006 world cup and after winning germany 's domestic treble last season he wants to translate domestic success to the european stage . with 39 goals and 75 caps , klose will turn 30 on monday with loew insisting he is in the form of his life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been in consistently good form for germany " miroslav has left a fantastic impression in training , i have never seen him that fit , that agile and strong , " said loew .
" the way he moves in training , you could see his old dynamic self coming back . " podolski , germany ’ s other polish-born striker , said he would treat sunday 's game against poland with the same fierce desire to see his side win in style . the 23-year-old speaks fluent polish and has been helping his team-mates pronounce the names of the opponents they will face in klagenfurt . poldi the polish spy the bayern munich striker still has relatives in poland and watches polish television at home , but he is keeping his fingers crossed that germany coach joachim loew will name him in the starting line-up to add to his 48 caps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi hopes to silence his doubters " things are going well and i am training as if i will be playing ; i 'll find out tomorrow or the day after if i am starting , " said podolski , who has been used as an attacking midfielder by loew in the past . " poland are a compact team with a good coach , but if we play at 100 percent and work hard i am sure we will win , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we go into this game confident , full of belief and with a certain degree of boldness , " loew told a news conference after the team 's arrival in the austrian host city of klagenfurt .
germany meet poland on sunday , june 8 .
midfielder torsten frings shared the optimism , saying ahead of the departure from the team 's swiss base camp : " we really believe that we can win the title .
if not we should n't be here . "
germany have not won a euro match since the 1996 final , which adds spice for loew in his biggest match to date as head coach since being promoted from assistant as successor to juergen klinsmann after the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain keep their cards close to their chests but the coach was upbeat that victory will finally come again after six winless matches in first-round exits in 2000 and 2004 .
" we want to end this series as soon as possible , ” loew said .
" i believe that we have a team that is capable of winning this first match .
if we perform to our capabilities then we will have a team that will take charge and dictate the rhythm . "
loew refused to reveal his starting lineup as some uncertainty remains around bayern munich players bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
all that loew was prepared to say was that " schweinsteiger has improved compared to the beginning of the week . "
gomez rumored to partner klose up front it appears that podolski will get the nod on the left wing instead of schweinsteiger and that vfb stuttgart 's high-scoring mario gomez will partner munich 's miroslav klose up front .
this lineup , which features captain michael ballack and frings as key midfielders , only underlines that germany are out to attack from the outset and to spare themselves the nerves they suffered at the world cup two years ago when they required an injury-time winner from oliver neuville to beat the poles .
a good win would also send a clear warning to the other group opponents austria and croatia , and to the other teams as well - looking ahead to the june 29 final in vienna .
loew ultimately has his sights set on the title but also warned that " it is the toughest tournament in the world " with little separating the teams .
loew calls on germany 's twelfth man germany held their final training session later behind closed doors , but loew had earlier appealed to the german fans in an open letter published in several german dailies .
bildunterschrift : germany 's twelfth man : the fans " our team does n't end with the shirt number 23 .
the millions of german fans are also part of it .
we saw at the summer fairy tale 2006 -lrb- germany 's run to third place at the world cup -rrb- what can be possible with enthusiasm and big support , " said loew .
" the euro title must not remain a dream if everyone involved seeks one common goal , ” he added .
" our mountain tour in the alpine countries of austria and switzerland is going to have a happy ending - on june 29 in the vienna final . ”
polish-born strikers germany 's main weapon loew will be hoping polish-born striker klose will be germany ’ s main weapon in that quest . the bayern munich striker , who was born in oppeln , poland , was top scorer at the 2006 world cup and after winning germany 's domestic treble last season he wants to translate domestic success to the european stage . with 39 goals and 75 caps , klose will turn 30 on monday with loew insisting he is in the form of his life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been in consistently good form for germany " miroslav has left a fantastic impression in training , i have never seen him that fit , that agile and strong , " said loew .
" the way he moves in training , you could see his old dynamic self coming back . " podolski , germany ’ s other polish-born striker , said he would treat sunday 's game against poland with the same fierce desire to see his side win in style . the 23-year-old speaks fluent polish and has been helping his team-mates pronounce the names of the opponents they will face in klagenfurt . poldi the polish spy the bayern munich striker still has relatives in poland and watches polish television at home , but he is keeping his fingers crossed that germany coach joachim loew will name him in the starting line-up to add to his 48 caps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi hopes to silence his doubters " things are going well and i am training as if i will be playing ; i 'll find out tomorrow or the day after if i am starting , " said podolski , who has been used as an attacking midfielder by loew in the past . " poland are a compact team with a good coach , but if we play at 100 percent and work hard i am sure we will win , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's always difficult - you never know where you are before the first game of a tournament .
i think we deserved victory .
from the start we were aggressive , " the chelsea star told the bbc . the poles were making their european championship debut , but are still yet to beat germany in 16 meetings between the sides since 1933 with the germans now claiming 12 wins with four draws between the neighbors . beenhakker had opted for five in midfield with ebi smolarek as the lone striker up front for poland . loew had gone for a traditional 4-4-2 formation , keeping midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - a star of the 2006 world cup - on the bench until half-time playing podolski behind the two german strikers . the move paid off as podolski gave germany an extra attacking option supporting front men miroslav klose , the top scorer at the last world cup , who was partnering vfb stuttgart hot-shot mario gomez up front . striking triumverate come up with the goods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski scored both goals from a new midfield role after both sides squandered early chances , the trio combined to give germany the break through they craved on 20 minutes . gomez flicked the ball over the defense for klose to draw the goalkeeper before giving his bayern munich team-mate podolski a simple tap in on 20 minutes past poland 's celtic goalkeeper artur boruc . poland 's best chance of the first half - and ultimately the game - came when midfielder wojciech lobodzinski put in a superb pass , but maciej zurawski pulled his shot wide .
polish striker smolarek picked up the first booking on 40 minutes when he tripped per mertesacker . during the half-time break , beenhakker swapped his captain maciej zurawski for brazilian-born roger guerreiro , but he made little impact and lobodzinski earned poland 's second yellow card on 64 minutes for tripping podolski . poldi 's double comes with little celebration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scorer remains reserved as his team-mates celebrate germany were dominating by this stage and when the ball fell to podolski on 72 minutes he drove his shot into the top corner of the net to give his side some breathing space . as with his first goal , podolski kept his emotions in check as not to celebrate to wildly his goals against his birth nation .
with a large family watching back in poland , poldi 's restraint was well-received by both sets of fans . as the game wore on , german goalkeeper jens lehmann produced a string of saves as poland applied some late pressure , but his defense held . the result means group b 's two unbeaten sides will meet thursday when germany return here to face croatia . ballack said he was looking forward to playing croatia but cautioned : " i think it 's an open game - both teams are very strong .

concerns about energy security are driving the renaissance . nearly 440 nuclear reactors churn out electricity across the globe and more than 30 new plants are being built as the world 's energy appetite grows and oil prices soar .
russia , china and india are leading the way in new construction .
in the european union , a push by eastern nations saddled with soviet- era reactors is fuelling tension with anti-nuclear eu nations .
in western europe , the balance is shifting after prime minister silvio berlusconi 's new government said in may it plans to relaunch nuclear power in italy , 21 years after a referendum sparked by the chernobyl disaster outlawed it .
" only a few years ago , supporters of nuclear energy were viewed as witches , " slovakian prime minister robert fico said last month .
" it is clear ... that without nuclear we will be unable to ensure energy security in europe . "
slovakia , one of europe 's fastest-growing economies , is a case in point . under its deal to enter the eu in 2004 , one communist-era reactor at the jaslovske bohunice plant shut down in 2006 and the other is slated to close by 2009 .

" this technology is so complex that breakdowns are the norm , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel , whose country - europe 's biggest economy - has decided to phase out nuclear power .
austria , where voters rejected nuclear power in a 1978 referendum , slammed slovenia for initially filing a mislabeled accident report to its neighbors .

france , which gets more than three-quarters of its electricity from nuclear plants , plans to add another one .
finland wants to build a fifth reactor .
bulgaria shut down four of six units at its soviet-era kozloduy plant under pressure from the eu before joining the bloc last year .
but two new reactors are to be finished by 2014 at belene , across the danube river from romania .
energy fears are particularly strong in the baltics .
lithuania 's hefty 1,185-megawatt ignalina plant , which uses a design similar to chernobyl and supplies nearly 70 per cent of the small nation 's electricity , is slated to close by the end of 2009 .
lithuania , latvia , estonia and poland are talking about building a new plant together .
not that nuclear power is suddenly getting a free ride .
safety concerns divide opinion but do n't slow return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krsko reactor had to be shut down recently when a coolant leak at slovenia 's krsko plant wednesday led to an alert to all 27 eu nations , rifts between supporters and foes opened up quickly .
" this technology is so complex that breakdowns are the norm , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel , whose country - europe 's biggest economy - has decided to phase out nuclear power .
austria , where voters rejected nuclear power in a 1978 referendum , slammed slovenia for initially filing a mislabeled accident report to its neighbors .
in italy , which also borders slovenia , leaders dismissed the scare as alarmist and said their country 's nuclear revival was firm .
" there will be no turning back , " economic development minister claudio scajola said .
" we have to go forward , because our country , and the entire planet , need energy . "
further north , slovaks and czechs are among the biggest supporters of nuclear power .
yet next-door austria regularly condemns their reactors as safety threats .
europeans want to see less nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of europe are against their governments ' plans one third of eu electricity comes from nuclear energy .
with eu officials saying that half of europe 's power plants need replacement by 2030 , polls show that most europeans want less , not more , nuclear .
a 2007 poll found that while most eu citizens expected energy prices to rise , 61 per cent wanted a smaller share for nuclear power .
yet even slovenia - population 2 million - is considering building a second reactor .
its current western-built unit released no radioactivity during wednesday 's breakdown , which was ranked as a minor mishap .
hans-holger rogner , an expert at the un international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said he doubts the public will long remember .
other factors are set to play a bigger role : the expense and long lead times of building nuclear plants , or possible shortages of uranium , the metal used to make reactor fuel .
" right now , i see the pendulum swinging toward nuclear energy , " rogner told reporters .
" but it can also reverse course . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 08.06.2008 goalkeepers unhappy but strikers have a ball with europass großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europass : " a tricky customer " the ball developed for the euro 2008 divides opinions of players and goalkeepers as the tournament in austria and switzerland kicks . while players hope the light high-tech ball will prove a goal bonanza , goalkeepers from several of the 16 participating teams find exactly those properties of the silver-grey adidas ball extremely worrying .
" basically no one is 100 percent satisfied with this ball , " andreas koepke , germany 's goalkeeper-coach told reporters at the german base camp in tenero , switzerland , on saturday , june 7 .
germany goalkeeper jens lehmann had repeatedly complained that it was difficult to catch and had a tendency to swirl .
co-host austria 's goalkeeper alexander manninger and czech goalie petr cech also expressed their dissatisfaction with the fast ball which is likely to make a goalkeeper 's life very difficult during the three-week tournament .
" this ball is not the keeper 's friend , " manninger said .
players however may see things a little different .
outfield stars eager to get to grips with europass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " look out lads , that thing could go anywhere " " for players , the ball is great , " germany midfielder thorsten frings said .
" there will be many more goals from a greater distance .
if you hit it right , it really goes off . "
yes , for keepers the ball presented a difficulty , frings admitted , but " we 'll get this sorted , " he said optimistically .
one thing field players and goalkeepers seem to agree on : the europass may change the way the game is played at this tournament .
" you have to be more awake with this ball , " koepke said .
the defense , for one , had to be more on the ball - so to speak .
as keepers were more likely to avoid the risk of catching this ball and will rather block it , defenders will have to be fully alert in those potentially risky situations and try to get the ball before the other team 's forwards , he explained .
at the same time , the forwards would of course try and get in their second chance .
germany 's goalies ready to face " tricky customer " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one minute it was there , coach , the next it was n't " using the europass brought some changes for training germany 's goalkeepers , koepke said .
field players were included in goalkeeper training routines to help the keepers adjust to the ball 's properties .
" it is pointless to lament this , " koepke said , adding that his team had tried to make the best of it .
" -lrb- but -rrb- i do n't think we will get more goals because the ball swirls , " koepke said .
adidas , which worked two years on the development of the ball , did not see such problems .
" the ball 's new surface structure allows players to control and direct it perfectly in all weather conditions , " the company said at the ball 's presentation .
its new surface texture on the outer skin guaranteed " optimum grip between ball and boot , " as well as better grip between glove and ball for goalkeepers . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we go into this game confident , full of belief and with a certain degree of boldness , " loew told a news conference after the team 's arrival in the austrian host city of klagenfurt .
germany meet poland on sunday , june 8 .
midfielder torsten frings shared the optimism , saying ahead of the departure from the team 's swiss base camp : " we really believe that we can win the title .
if not we should n't be here . "
germany have not won a euro match since the 1996 final , which adds spice for loew in his biggest match to date as head coach since being promoted from assistant as successor to juergen klinsmann after the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain keep their cards close to their chests but the coach was upbeat that victory will finally come again after six winless matches in first-round exits in 2000 and 2004 .
" we want to end this series as soon as possible , ” loew said .
" i believe that we have a team that is capable of winning this first match .
if we perform to our capabilities then we will have a team that will take charge and dictate the rhythm . "
loew refused to reveal his starting lineup as some uncertainty remains around bayern munich players bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
all that loew was prepared to say was that " schweinsteiger has improved compared to the beginning of the week . "
gomez rumored to partner klose up front it appears that podolski will get the nod on the left wing instead of schweinsteiger and that vfb stuttgart 's high-scoring mario gomez will partner munich 's miroslav klose up front .
this lineup , which features captain michael ballack and frings as key midfielders , only underlines that germany are out to attack from the outset and to spare themselves the nerves they suffered at the world cup two years ago when they required an injury-time winner from oliver neuville to beat the poles .
a good win would also send a clear warning to the other group opponents austria and croatia , and to the other teams as well - looking ahead to the june 29 final in vienna .
loew ultimately has his sights set on the title but also warned that " it is the toughest tournament in the world " with little separating the teams .
loew calls on germany 's twelfth man germany held their final training session later behind closed doors , but loew had earlier appealed to the german fans in an open letter published in several german dailies .
bildunterschrift : germany 's twelfth man : the fans " our team does n't end with the shirt number 23 .
the millions of german fans are also part of it .
we saw at the summer fairy tale 2006 -lrb- germany 's run to third place at the world cup -rrb- what can be possible with enthusiasm and big support , " said loew .
" the euro title must not remain a dream if everyone involved seeks one common goal , ” he added .
" our mountain tour in the alpine countries of austria and switzerland is going to have a happy ending - on june 29 in the vienna final . ”
polish-born strikers germany 's main weapon loew will be hoping polish-born striker klose will be germany ’ s main weapon in that quest . the bayern munich striker , who was born in oppeln , poland , was top scorer at the 2006 world cup and after winning germany 's domestic treble last season he wants to translate domestic success to the european stage . with 39 goals and 75 caps , klose will turn 30 on monday with loew insisting he is in the form of his life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been in consistently good form for germany " miroslav has left a fantastic impression in training , i have never seen him that fit , that agile and strong , " said loew .
" the way he moves in training , you could see his old dynamic self coming back . " podolski , germany ’ s other polish-born striker , said he would treat sunday 's game against poland with the same fierce desire to see his side win in style . the 23-year-old speaks fluent polish and has been helping his team-mates pronounce the names of the opponents they will face in klagenfurt . poldi the polish spy the bayern munich striker still has relatives in poland and watches polish television at home , but he is keeping his fingers crossed that germany coach joachim loew will name him in the starting line-up to add to his 48 caps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi hopes to silence his doubters " things are going well and i am training as if i will be playing ; i 'll find out tomorrow or the day after if i am starting , " said podolski , who has been used as an attacking midfielder by loew in the past .

" basically no one is 100 percent satisfied with this ball , " andreas koepke , germany 's goalkeeper-coach told reporters at the german base camp in tenero , switzerland , on saturday , june 7 .
germany goalkeeper jens lehmann had repeatedly complained that it was difficult to catch and had a tendency to swirl .
co-host austria 's goalkeeper alexander manninger and czech goalie petr cech also expressed their dissatisfaction with the fast ball which is likely to make a goalkeeper 's life very difficult during the three-week tournament .
" this ball is not the keeper 's friend , " manninger said .
players however may see things a little different .
outfield stars eager to get to grips with europass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " look out lads , that thing could go anywhere " " for players , the ball is great , " germany midfielder thorsten frings said .
" there will be many more goals from a greater distance .
if you hit it right , it really goes off . "
yes , for keepers the ball presented a difficulty , frings admitted , but " we 'll get this sorted , " he said optimistically .
one thing field players and goalkeepers seem to agree on : the europass may change the way the game is played at this tournament .
" you have to be more awake with this ball , " koepke said .
the defense , for one , had to be more on the ball - so to speak .
as keepers were more likely to avoid the risk of catching this ball and will rather block it , defenders will have to be fully alert in those potentially risky situations and try to get the ball before the other team 's forwards , he explained .
at the same time , the forwards would of course try and get in their second chance .
germany 's goalies ready to face " tricky customer " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one minute it was there , coach , the next it was n't " using the europass brought some changes for training germany 's goalkeepers , koepke said .
field players were included in goalkeeper training routines to help the keepers adjust to the ball 's properties .
" it is pointless to lament this , " koepke said , adding that his team had tried to make the best of it .
" -lrb- but -rrb- i do n't think we will get more goals because the ball swirls , " koepke said .
adidas , which worked two years on the development of the ball , did not see such problems .
" the ball 's new surface structure allows players to control and direct it perfectly in all weather conditions , " the company said at the ball 's presentation .

" we go into this game confident , full of belief and with a certain degree of boldness , " loew told a news conference after the team 's arrival in the austrian host city of klagenfurt .
germany meet poland on sunday , june 8 .
midfielder torsten frings shared the optimism , saying ahead of the departure from the team 's swiss base camp : " we really believe that we can win the title .
if not we should n't be here . "
germany have not won a euro match since the 1996 final , which adds spice for loew in his biggest match to date as head coach since being promoted from assistant as successor to juergen klinsmann after the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain keep their cards close to their chests but the coach was upbeat that victory will finally come again after six winless matches in first-round exits in 2000 and 2004 .
" we want to end this series as soon as possible , ” loew said .
" i believe that we have a team that is capable of winning this first match .
if we perform to our capabilities then we will have a team that will take charge and dictate the rhythm . "
loew refused to reveal his starting lineup as some uncertainty remains around bayern munich players bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
all that loew was prepared to say was that " schweinsteiger has improved compared to the beginning of the week . "
gomez rumored to partner klose up front it appears that podolski will get the nod on the left wing instead of schweinsteiger and that vfb stuttgart 's high-scoring mario gomez will partner munich 's miroslav klose up front .
this lineup , which features captain michael ballack and frings as key midfielders , only underlines that germany are out to attack from the outset and to spare themselves the nerves they suffered at the world cup two years ago when they required an injury-time winner from oliver neuville to beat the poles .
a good win would also send a clear warning to the other group opponents austria and croatia , and to the other teams as well - looking ahead to the june 29 final in vienna .
loew ultimately has his sights set on the title but also warned that " it is the toughest tournament in the world " with little separating the teams .
loew calls on germany 's twelfth man germany held their final training session later behind closed doors , but loew had earlier appealed to the german fans in an open letter published in several german dailies .
bildunterschrift : germany 's twelfth man : the fans " our team does n't end with the shirt number 23 .
the millions of german fans are also part of it .
we saw at the summer fairy tale 2006 -lrb- germany 's run to third place at the world cup -rrb- what can be possible with enthusiasm and big support , " said loew .
" the euro title must not remain a dream if everyone involved seeks one common goal , ” he added .
" our mountain tour in the alpine countries of austria and switzerland is going to have a happy ending - on june 29 in the vienna final . ”
polish-born strikers germany 's main weapon loew will be hoping polish-born striker klose will be germany ’ s main weapon in that quest . the bayern munich striker , who was born in oppeln , poland , was top scorer at the 2006 world cup and after winning germany 's domestic treble last season he wants to translate domestic success to the european stage . with 39 goals and 75 caps , klose will turn 30 on monday with loew insisting he is in the form of his life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been in consistently good form for germany " miroslav has left a fantastic impression in training , i have never seen him that fit , that agile and strong , " said loew .
" the way he moves in training , you could see his old dynamic self coming back . " podolski , germany ’ s other polish-born striker , said he would treat sunday 's game against poland with the same fierce desire to see his side win in style . the 23-year-old speaks fluent polish and has been helping his team-mates pronounce the names of the opponents they will face in klagenfurt . poldi the polish spy the bayern munich striker still has relatives in poland and watches polish television at home , but he is keeping his fingers crossed that germany coach joachim loew will name him in the starting line-up to add to his 48 caps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi hopes to silence his doubters " things are going well and i am training as if i will be playing ; i 'll find out tomorrow or the day after if i am starting , " said podolski , who has been used as an attacking midfielder by loew in the past .

concerns about energy security are driving the renaissance . nearly 440 nuclear reactors churn out electricity across the globe and more than 30 new plants are being built as the world 's energy appetite grows and oil prices soar .
russia , china and india are leading the way in new construction .
in the european union , a push by eastern nations saddled with soviet- era reactors is fuelling tension with anti-nuclear eu nations .
in western europe , the balance is shifting after prime minister silvio berlusconi 's new government said in may it plans to relaunch nuclear power in italy , 21 years after a referendum sparked by the chernobyl disaster outlawed it .
" only a few years ago , supporters of nuclear energy were viewed as witches , " slovakian prime minister robert fico said last month .
" it is clear ... that without nuclear we will be unable to ensure energy security in europe . "
slovakia , one of europe 's fastest-growing economies , is a case in point . under its deal to enter the eu in 2004 , one communist-era reactor at the jaslovske bohunice plant shut down in 2006 and the other is slated to close by 2009 .
to make up the shortfall and feed economic growth , slovakia wants to get two , possibly three , new nuclear plants online over the next few years .

" this technology is so complex that breakdowns are the norm , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel , whose country - europe 's biggest economy - has decided to phase out nuclear power .
austria , where voters rejected nuclear power in a 1978 referendum , slammed slovenia for initially filing a mislabeled accident report to its neighbors .
in italy , which also borders slovenia , leaders dismissed the scare as alarmist and said their country 's nuclear revival was firm .
" there will be no turning back , " economic development minister claudio scajola said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 08.06.2008 nuclear power returns despite safety scares and opposition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of nuclear reactors is increasing across the globe despite concerns nuclear power is on the advance worldwide , and a recent safety scare in europe is highly unlikely to stop it .
concerns about energy security are driving the renaissance . nearly 440 nuclear reactors churn out electricity across the globe and more than 30 new plants are being built as the world 's energy appetite grows and oil prices soar .
russia , china and india are leading the way in new construction .
in the european union , a push by eastern nations saddled with soviet- era reactors is fuelling tension with anti-nuclear eu nations .
in western europe , the balance is shifting after prime minister silvio berlusconi 's new government said in may it plans to relaunch nuclear power in italy , 21 years after a referendum sparked by the chernobyl disaster outlawed it .
" only a few years ago , supporters of nuclear energy were viewed as witches , " slovakian prime minister robert fico said last month .
" it is clear ... that without nuclear we will be unable to ensure energy security in europe . "
slovakia , one of europe 's fastest-growing economies , is a case in point . under its deal to enter the eu in 2004 , one communist-era reactor at the jaslovske bohunice plant shut down in 2006 and the other is slated to close by 2009 .
to make up the shortfall and feed economic growth , slovakia wants to get two , possibly three , new nuclear plants online over the next few years .
" a war for access to energy sources has started - a war for investment opportunities , " fico said .
nuclear power seen as greener alternative to oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear is seen as the greener alternative to fossil fuels for ex-communist eastern europe , limiting dependence on russian oil and gas is a big factor .
and as eu governments jointly seek to fight global warming , nuclear power is increasingly attractive because it emits almost no greenhouse gases .
france , which gets more than three-quarters of its electricity from nuclear plants , plans to add another one .
finland wants to build a fifth reactor .
bulgaria shut down four of six units at its soviet-era kozloduy plant under pressure from the eu before joining the bloc last year .
but two new reactors are to be finished by 2014 at belene , across the danube river from romania .
energy fears are particularly strong in the baltics .
lithuania 's hefty 1,185-megawatt ignalina plant , which uses a design similar to chernobyl and supplies nearly 70 per cent of the small nation 's electricity , is slated to close by the end of 2009 .
lithuania , latvia , estonia and poland are talking about building a new plant together .
not that nuclear power is suddenly getting a free ride .
safety concerns divide opinion but do n't slow return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krsko reactor had to be shut down recently when a coolant leak at slovenia 's krsko plant wednesday led to an alert to all 27 eu nations , rifts between supporters and foes opened up quickly .
" this technology is so complex that breakdowns are the norm , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel , whose country - europe 's biggest economy - has decided to phase out nuclear power .
austria , where voters rejected nuclear power in a 1978 referendum , slammed slovenia for initially filing a mislabeled accident report to its neighbors .
in italy , which also borders slovenia , leaders dismissed the scare as alarmist and said their country 's nuclear revival was firm .
" there will be no turning back , " economic development minister claudio scajola said .
" we have to go forward , because our country , and the entire planet , need energy . "
further north , slovaks and czechs are among the biggest supporters of nuclear power .
yet next-door austria regularly condemns their reactors as safety threats .
europeans want to see less nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of europe are against their governments ' plans one third of eu electricity comes from nuclear energy .
with eu officials saying that half of europe 's power plants need replacement by 2030 , polls show that most europeans want less , not more , nuclear .
a 2007 poll found that while most eu citizens expected energy prices to rise , 61 per cent wanted a smaller share for nuclear power .
yet even slovenia - population 2 million - is considering building a second reactor .
its current western-built unit released no radioactivity during wednesday 's breakdown , which was ranked as a minor mishap .
hans-holger rogner , an expert at the un international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said he doubts the public will long remember .
other factors are set to play a bigger role : the expense and long lead times of building nuclear plants , or possible shortages of uranium , the metal used to make reactor fuel .
" right now , i see the pendulum swinging toward nuclear energy , " rogner told reporters .
" but it can also reverse course . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de slovenia says nuclear incident was not dangerous slovenia reassured eu nations on thursday that a water leak at its krsko nuclear plant , which sparked alarm across the bloc , posed no danger and that the plant would resume operations next week .

the 8 percent increase marked the biggest ever one-day surge . " if we leave this situation as it is , it could lead to a recession of the world economy , " japan 's energy minister akira amari said on sunday in an opening address .
" ensuring energy security , including stability of the oil market , has become one of the top priorities for every country . " climate change linked to energy amari said the 11 countries meeting in aomori together consume 65 percent of the world 's energy and release 65 percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions . " climate change and energy issues are two sides of the same coin , " he said .
" it is indispensible to solve these problems together . " the participants pledged to launch 20 test projects by 2010 on so-called carbon capture and storage , which involves catching carbon emissions from power plants and injecting them into underground storage areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to phase out nuclear power , but not all g8 powers agree while the technology for carbon capture and storage is not yet fully developed and remains hotly disputed , advocates say it could allow the earth 's abundant supply of coal to be processed without polluting the environment . nuclear energy remains a divider differences of opinion among the participants on the expansion of nuclear energy were not bridged at sunday 's conference .

14 -rrb- spot-kick did not bring the flood of goals some commentators expected luka modric 's fourth minute penalty gave croatia victory over austria in vienna sunday , june 8 but slaven bilic 's much-fancied side had to survive long periods of austrian dominance before the win was theirs . euro 2008 co-hosts austria kicked off their campaign with an undeserved 1-0 defeat at home in vienna to croatia on sunday , in the first group b game . croatia were technically superior to josef hickersberger 's team , but were relieved to hear the final whistle after surviving a spirited second-half austrian frontal assault . austria made a nervous start , as if overwhelmed by the responsibility of being hosts - and aware of their own technical inferiority . hickerersberger started with a cautious 5-4-1 formation . penalty adds to austrian nerves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia failed to add to their early opener however , his plans went up in smoke after just four minutes , when luka modric opened the scoring from the penalty spot after rene aufhauser had clumsily clattered into croatia striker ivica olic . croatia should have put austria out of their misery in the first half , but olic and mladen petric squandered good chances . austria slowly came out of their defensive shell but could only create danger with free-kicks and high centers . austria continued their direct assault in the second half , livening up the capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion with a series of corners and goalmouth scrambles . the ageless ivica vastic came off the bench in the second half to finally give the austrian attack a touch of quality . fellow sub umit korkmaz forced a sharp save out of croatia keeper stipe pletikosa with just four minutes left . chances come thick and fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far from imploding , austria pushed croatia all the way in stoppage time , with tired croatia desperate to hear the whistle , roman kienast glanced a high header just wide of pletikosa 's far post . a draw would have been a fairer result than a croatia win . austrian defender martin stranzl said that they still believed they stood a chance to advance to the next round .
" we played very well after starting poorly . " we were very nervous at first , but then came into the game .

concerns about energy security are driving the renaissance . nearly 440 nuclear reactors churn out electricity across the globe and more than 30 new plants are being built as the world 's energy appetite grows and oil prices soar .
russia , china and india are leading the way in new construction .
in the european union , a push by eastern nations saddled with soviet- era reactors is fuelling tension with anti-nuclear eu nations .
in western europe , the balance is shifting after prime minister silvio berlusconi 's new government said in may it plans to relaunch nuclear power in italy , 21 years after a referendum sparked by the chernobyl disaster outlawed it .
" only a few years ago , supporters of nuclear energy were viewed as witches , " slovakian prime minister robert fico said last month .
" it is clear ... that without nuclear we will be unable to ensure energy security in europe . "
slovakia , one of europe 's fastest-growing economies , is a case in point . under its deal to enter the eu in 2004 , one communist-era reactor at the jaslovske bohunice plant shut down in 2006 and the other is slated to close by 2009 .
to make up the shortfall and feed economic growth , slovakia wants to get two , possibly three , new nuclear plants online over the next few years .
" a war for access to energy sources has started - a war for investment opportunities , " fico said .
nuclear power seen as greener alternative to oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear is seen as the greener alternative to fossil fuels for ex-communist eastern europe , limiting dependence on russian oil and gas is a big factor .
and as eu governments jointly seek to fight global warming , nuclear power is increasingly attractive because it emits almost no greenhouse gases .
france , which gets more than three-quarters of its electricity from nuclear plants , plans to add another one .
finland wants to build a fifth reactor .
bulgaria shut down four of six units at its soviet-era kozloduy plant under pressure from the eu before joining the bloc last year .
but two new reactors are to be finished by 2014 at belene , across the danube river from romania .
energy fears are particularly strong in the baltics .
lithuania 's hefty 1,185-megawatt ignalina plant , which uses a design similar to chernobyl and supplies nearly 70 per cent of the small nation 's electricity , is slated to close by the end of 2009 .
lithuania , latvia , estonia and poland are talking about building a new plant together .
not that nuclear power is suddenly getting a free ride .
safety concerns divide opinion but do n't slow return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krsko reactor had to be shut down recently when a coolant leak at slovenia 's krsko plant wednesday led to an alert to all 27 eu nations , rifts between supporters and foes opened up quickly .
" this technology is so complex that breakdowns are the norm , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel , whose country - europe 's biggest economy - has decided to phase out nuclear power .
austria , where voters rejected nuclear power in a 1978 referendum , slammed slovenia for initially filing a mislabeled accident report to its neighbors .
in italy , which also borders slovenia , leaders dismissed the scare as alarmist and said their country 's nuclear revival was firm .
" there will be no turning back , " economic development minister claudio scajola said .
" we have to go forward , because our country , and the entire planet , need energy . "
further north , slovaks and czechs are among the biggest supporters of nuclear power .
yet next-door austria regularly condemns their reactors as safety threats .
europeans want to see less nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of europe are against their governments ' plans one third of eu electricity comes from nuclear energy .
with eu officials saying that half of europe 's power plants need replacement by 2030 , polls show that most europeans want less , not more , nuclear .
a 2007 poll found that while most eu citizens expected energy prices to rise , 61 per cent wanted a smaller share for nuclear power .
yet even slovenia - population 2 million - is considering building a second reactor .
its current western-built unit released no radioactivity during wednesday 's breakdown , which was ranked as a minor mishap .
hans-holger rogner , an expert at the un international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said he doubts the public will long remember .
other factors are set to play a bigger role : the expense and long lead times of building nuclear plants , or possible shortages of uranium , the metal used to make reactor fuel .

" basically no one is 100 percent satisfied with this ball , " andreas koepke , germany 's goalkeeper-coach told reporters at the german base camp in tenero , switzerland , on saturday , june 7 .
germany goalkeeper jens lehmann had repeatedly complained that it was difficult to catch and had a tendency to swirl .
co-host austria 's goalkeeper alexander manninger and czech goalie petr cech also expressed their dissatisfaction with the fast ball which is likely to make a goalkeeper 's life very difficult during the three-week tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 08.06.2008 germany enter euro 2008 campaign with confidence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany coach joachim loew has been keeping his team 's preparations under wraps germany will enter their first euro 2008 match against poland determined to make an impression , coach joachim loew said ahead of the group b clash . " we go into this game confident , full of belief and with a certain degree of boldness , " loew told a news conference after the team 's arrival in the austrian host city of klagenfurt .
germany meet poland on sunday , june 8 .
midfielder torsten frings shared the optimism , saying ahead of the departure from the team 's swiss base camp : " we really believe that we can win the title .
if not we should n't be here . "
germany have not won a euro match since the 1996 final , which adds spice for loew in his biggest match to date as head coach since being promoted from assistant as successor to juergen klinsmann after the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain keep their cards close to their chests but the coach was upbeat that victory will finally come again after six winless matches in first-round exits in 2000 and 2004 .
" we want to end this series as soon as possible , ” loew said .
" i believe that we have a team that is capable of winning this first match .
if we perform to our capabilities then we will have a team that will take charge and dictate the rhythm . "
loew refused to reveal his starting lineup as some uncertainty remains around bayern munich players bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
all that loew was prepared to say was that " schweinsteiger has improved compared to the beginning of the week . "
gomez rumored to partner klose up front it appears that podolski will get the nod on the left wing instead of schweinsteiger and that vfb stuttgart 's high-scoring mario gomez will partner munich 's miroslav klose up front .
this lineup , which features captain michael ballack and frings as key midfielders , only underlines that germany are out to attack from the outset and to spare themselves the nerves they suffered at the world cup two years ago when they required an injury-time winner from oliver neuville to beat the poles .

" we go into this game confident , full of belief and with a certain degree of boldness , " loew told a news conference after the team 's arrival in the austrian host city of klagenfurt .
germany meet poland on sunday , june 8 .
midfielder torsten frings shared the optimism , saying ahead of the departure from the team 's swiss base camp : " we really believe that we can win the title .
if not we should n't be here . "
germany have not won a euro match since the 1996 final , which adds spice for loew in his biggest match to date as head coach since being promoted from assistant as successor to juergen klinsmann after the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain keep their cards close to their chests but the coach was upbeat that victory will finally come again after six winless matches in first-round exits in 2000 and 2004 .
" we want to end this series as soon as possible , ” loew said .
" i believe that we have a team that is capable of winning this first match .
if we perform to our capabilities then we will have a team that will take charge and dictate the rhythm . "
loew refused to reveal his starting lineup as some uncertainty remains around bayern munich players bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
all that loew was prepared to say was that " schweinsteiger has improved compared to the beginning of the week . "
gomez rumored to partner klose up front it appears that podolski will get the nod on the left wing instead of schweinsteiger and that vfb stuttgart 's high-scoring mario gomez will partner munich 's miroslav klose up front .
this lineup , which features captain michael ballack and frings as key midfielders , only underlines that germany are out to attack from the outset and to spare themselves the nerves they suffered at the world cup two years ago when they required an injury-time winner from oliver neuville to beat the poles .
a good win would also send a clear warning to the other group opponents austria and croatia , and to the other teams as well - looking ahead to the june 29 final in vienna .
loew ultimately has his sights set on the title but also warned that " it is the toughest tournament in the world " with little separating the teams .
loew calls on germany 's twelfth man germany held their final training session later behind closed doors , but loew had earlier appealed to the german fans in an open letter published in several german dailies .

" we go into this game confident , full of belief and with a certain degree of boldness , " loew told a news conference after the team 's arrival in the austrian host city of klagenfurt .
germany meet poland on sunday , june 8 .
midfielder torsten frings shared the optimism , saying ahead of the departure from the team 's swiss base camp : " we really believe that we can win the title .
if not we should n't be here . "
germany have not won a euro match since the 1996 final , which adds spice for loew in his biggest match to date as head coach since being promoted from assistant as successor to juergen klinsmann after the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain keep their cards close to their chests but the coach was upbeat that victory will finally come again after six winless matches in first-round exits in 2000 and 2004 .
" we want to end this series as soon as possible , ” loew said .
" i believe that we have a team that is capable of winning this first match .
if we perform to our capabilities then we will have a team that will take charge and dictate the rhythm . "
loew refused to reveal his starting lineup as some uncertainty remains around bayern munich players bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
all that loew was prepared to say was that " schweinsteiger has improved compared to the beginning of the week . "
gomez rumored to partner klose up front it appears that podolski will get the nod on the left wing instead of schweinsteiger and that vfb stuttgart 's high-scoring mario gomez will partner munich 's miroslav klose up front .
this lineup , which features captain michael ballack and frings as key midfielders , only underlines that germany are out to attack from the outset and to spare themselves the nerves they suffered at the world cup two years ago when they required an injury-time winner from oliver neuville to beat the poles .
a good win would also send a clear warning to the other group opponents austria and croatia , and to the other teams as well - looking ahead to the june 29 final in vienna .
loew ultimately has his sights set on the title but also warned that " it is the toughest tournament in the world " with little separating the teams .
loew calls on germany 's twelfth man germany held their final training session later behind closed doors , but loew had earlier appealed to the german fans in an open letter published in several german dailies .
bildunterschrift : germany 's twelfth man : the fans " our team does n't end with the shirt number 23 .
the millions of german fans are also part of it .
we saw at the summer fairy tale 2006 -lrb- germany 's run to third place at the world cup -rrb- what can be possible with enthusiasm and big support , " said loew .
" the euro title must not remain a dream if everyone involved seeks one common goal , ” he added .
" our mountain tour in the alpine countries of austria and switzerland is going to have a happy ending - on june 29 in the vienna final . ”
polish-born strikers germany 's main weapon loew will be hoping polish-born striker klose will be germany ’ s main weapon in that quest . the bayern munich striker , who was born in oppeln , poland , was top scorer at the 2006 world cup and after winning germany 's domestic treble last season he wants to translate domestic success to the european stage . with 39 goals and 75 caps , klose will turn 30 on monday with loew insisting he is in the form of his life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been in consistently good form for germany " miroslav has left a fantastic impression in training , i have never seen him that fit , that agile and strong , " said loew .
" the way he moves in training , you could see his old dynamic self coming back . " podolski , germany ’ s other polish-born striker , said he would treat sunday 's game against poland with the same fierce desire to see his side win in style . the 23-year-old speaks fluent polish and has been helping his team-mates pronounce the names of the opponents they will face in klagenfurt . poldi the polish spy the bayern munich striker still has relatives in poland and watches polish television at home , but he is keeping his fingers crossed that germany coach joachim loew will name him in the starting line-up to add to his 48 caps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi hopes to silence his doubters " things are going well and i am training as if i will be playing ; i 'll find out tomorrow or the day after if i am starting , " said podolski , who has been used as an attacking midfielder by loew in the past . " poland are a compact team with a good coach , but if we play at 100 percent and work hard i am sure we will win , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we go into this game confident , full of belief and with a certain degree of boldness , " loew told a news conference after the team 's arrival in the austrian host city of klagenfurt .
germany meet poland on sunday , june 8 .
midfielder torsten frings shared the optimism , saying ahead of the departure from the team 's swiss base camp : " we really believe that we can win the title .
if not we should n't be here . "
germany have not won a euro match since the 1996 final , which adds spice for loew in his biggest match to date as head coach since being promoted from assistant as successor to juergen klinsmann after the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain keep their cards close to their chests but the coach was upbeat that victory will finally come again after six winless matches in first-round exits in 2000 and 2004 .
" we want to end this series as soon as possible , ” loew said .
" i believe that we have a team that is capable of winning this first match .
if we perform to our capabilities then we will have a team that will take charge and dictate the rhythm . "
loew refused to reveal his starting lineup as some uncertainty remains around bayern munich players bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
all that loew was prepared to say was that " schweinsteiger has improved compared to the beginning of the week . "
gomez rumored to partner klose up front it appears that podolski will get the nod on the left wing instead of schweinsteiger and that vfb stuttgart 's high-scoring mario gomez will partner munich 's miroslav klose up front .
this lineup , which features captain michael ballack and frings as key midfielders , only underlines that germany are out to attack from the outset and to spare themselves the nerves they suffered at the world cup two years ago when they required an injury-time winner from oliver neuville to beat the poles .
a good win would also send a clear warning to the other group opponents austria and croatia , and to the other teams as well - looking ahead to the june 29 final in vienna .
loew ultimately has his sights set on the title but also warned that " it is the toughest tournament in the world " with little separating the teams .
loew calls on germany 's twelfth man germany held their final training session later behind closed doors , but loew had earlier appealed to the german fans in an open letter published in several german dailies .
bildunterschrift : germany 's twelfth man : the fans " our team does n't end with the shirt number 23 .
the millions of german fans are also part of it .
we saw at the summer fairy tale 2006 -lrb- germany 's run to third place at the world cup -rrb- what can be possible with enthusiasm and big support , " said loew .
" the euro title must not remain a dream if everyone involved seeks one common goal , ” he added .
" our mountain tour in the alpine countries of austria and switzerland is going to have a happy ending - on june 29 in the vienna final . ”
polish-born strikers germany 's main weapon loew will be hoping polish-born striker klose will be germany ’ s main weapon in that quest . the bayern munich striker , who was born in oppeln , poland , was top scorer at the 2006 world cup and after winning germany 's domestic treble last season he wants to translate domestic success to the european stage . with 39 goals and 75 caps , klose will turn 30 on monday with loew insisting he is in the form of his life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been in consistently good form for germany " miroslav has left a fantastic impression in training , i have never seen him that fit , that agile and strong , " said loew .
" the way he moves in training , you could see his old dynamic self coming back . " podolski , germany ’ s other polish-born striker , said he would treat sunday 's game against poland with the same fierce desire to see his side win in style . the 23-year-old speaks fluent polish and has been helping his team-mates pronounce the names of the opponents they will face in klagenfurt . poldi the polish spy the bayern munich striker still has relatives in poland and watches polish television at home , but he is keeping his fingers crossed that germany coach joachim loew will name him in the starting line-up to add to his 48 caps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi hopes to silence his doubters " things are going well and i am training as if i will be playing ; i 'll find out tomorrow or the day after if i am starting , " said podolski , who has been used as an attacking midfielder by loew in the past . " poland are a compact team with a good coach , but if we play at 100 percent and work hard i am sure we will win , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 08.06.2008 germany enter euro 2008 campaign with confidence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany coach joachim loew has been keeping his team 's preparations under wraps germany will enter their first euro 2008 match against poland determined to make an impression , coach joachim loew said ahead of the group b clash . " we go into this game confident , full of belief and with a certain degree of boldness , " loew told a news conference after the team 's arrival in the austrian host city of klagenfurt .
germany meet poland on sunday , june 8 .
midfielder torsten frings shared the optimism , saying ahead of the departure from the team 's swiss base camp : " we really believe that we can win the title .
if not we should n't be here . "
germany have not won a euro match since the 1996 final , which adds spice for loew in his biggest match to date as head coach since being promoted from assistant as successor to juergen klinsmann after the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain keep their cards close to their chests but the coach was upbeat that victory will finally come again after six winless matches in first-round exits in 2000 and 2004 .
" we want to end this series as soon as possible , ” loew said .
" i believe that we have a team that is capable of winning this first match .
if we perform to our capabilities then we will have a team that will take charge and dictate the rhythm . "
loew refused to reveal his starting lineup as some uncertainty remains around bayern munich players bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
all that loew was prepared to say was that " schweinsteiger has improved compared to the beginning of the week . "
gomez rumored to partner klose up front it appears that podolski will get the nod on the left wing instead of schweinsteiger and that vfb stuttgart 's high-scoring mario gomez will partner munich 's miroslav klose up front .
this lineup , which features captain michael ballack and frings as key midfielders , only underlines that germany are out to attack from the outset and to spare themselves the nerves they suffered at the world cup two years ago when they required an injury-time winner from oliver neuville to beat the poles .
a good win would also send a clear warning to the other group opponents austria and croatia , and to the other teams as well - looking ahead to the june 29 final in vienna .
loew ultimately has his sights set on the title but also warned that " it is the toughest tournament in the world " with little separating the teams .
loew calls on germany 's twelfth man germany held their final training session later behind closed doors , but loew had earlier appealed to the german fans in an open letter published in several german dailies .
bildunterschrift : germany 's twelfth man : the fans " our team does n't end with the shirt number 23 .
the millions of german fans are also part of it .
we saw at the summer fairy tale 2006 -lrb- germany 's run to third place at the world cup -rrb- what can be possible with enthusiasm and big support , " said loew .
" the euro title must not remain a dream if everyone involved seeks one common goal , ” he added .
" our mountain tour in the alpine countries of austria and switzerland is going to have a happy ending - on june 29 in the vienna final . ”
polish-born strikers germany 's main weapon loew will be hoping polish-born striker klose will be germany ’ s main weapon in that quest . the bayern munich striker , who was born in oppeln , poland , was top scorer at the 2006 world cup and after winning germany 's domestic treble last season he wants to translate domestic success to the european stage . with 39 goals and 75 caps , klose will turn 30 on monday with loew insisting he is in the form of his life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been in consistently good form for germany " miroslav has left a fantastic impression in training , i have never seen him that fit , that agile and strong , " said loew .
" the way he moves in training , you could see his old dynamic self coming back . " podolski , germany ’ s other polish-born striker , said he would treat sunday 's game against poland with the same fierce desire to see his side win in style . the 23-year-old speaks fluent polish and has been helping his team-mates pronounce the names of the opponents they will face in klagenfurt . poldi the polish spy the bayern munich striker still has relatives in poland and watches polish television at home , but he is keeping his fingers crossed that germany coach joachim loew will name him in the starting line-up to add to his 48 caps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi hopes to silence his doubters " things are going well and i am training as if i will be playing ; i 'll find out tomorrow or the day after if i am starting , " said podolski , who has been used as an attacking midfielder by loew in the past . " poland are a compact team with a good coach , but if we play at 100 percent and work hard i am sure we will win , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 08.06.2008 nuclear power returns despite safety scares and opposition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of nuclear reactors is increasing across the globe despite concerns nuclear power is on the advance worldwide , and a recent safety scare in europe is highly unlikely to stop it .
concerns about energy security are driving the renaissance . nearly 440 nuclear reactors churn out electricity across the globe and more than 30 new plants are being built as the world 's energy appetite grows and oil prices soar .
russia , china and india are leading the way in new construction .
in the european union , a push by eastern nations saddled with soviet- era reactors is fuelling tension with anti-nuclear eu nations .
in western europe , the balance is shifting after prime minister silvio berlusconi 's new government said in may it plans to relaunch nuclear power in italy , 21 years after a referendum sparked by the chernobyl disaster outlawed it .
" only a few years ago , supporters of nuclear energy were viewed as witches , " slovakian prime minister robert fico said last month .
" it is clear ... that without nuclear we will be unable to ensure energy security in europe . "
slovakia , one of europe 's fastest-growing economies , is a case in point . under its deal to enter the eu in 2004 , one communist-era reactor at the jaslovske bohunice plant shut down in 2006 and the other is slated to close by 2009 .
to make up the shortfall and feed economic growth , slovakia wants to get two , possibly three , new nuclear plants online over the next few years .
" a war for access to energy sources has started - a war for investment opportunities , " fico said .
nuclear power seen as greener alternative to oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear is seen as the greener alternative to fossil fuels for ex-communist eastern europe , limiting dependence on russian oil and gas is a big factor .
and as eu governments jointly seek to fight global warming , nuclear power is increasingly attractive because it emits almost no greenhouse gases .
france , which gets more than three-quarters of its electricity from nuclear plants , plans to add another one .
finland wants to build a fifth reactor .
bulgaria shut down four of six units at its soviet-era kozloduy plant under pressure from the eu before joining the bloc last year .
but two new reactors are to be finished by 2014 at belene , across the danube river from romania .
energy fears are particularly strong in the baltics .
lithuania 's hefty 1,185-megawatt ignalina plant , which uses a design similar to chernobyl and supplies nearly 70 per cent of the small nation 's electricity , is slated to close by the end of 2009 .
lithuania , latvia , estonia and poland are talking about building a new plant together .
not that nuclear power is suddenly getting a free ride .
safety concerns divide opinion but do n't slow return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krsko reactor had to be shut down recently when a coolant leak at slovenia 's krsko plant wednesday led to an alert to all 27 eu nations , rifts between supporters and foes opened up quickly .
" this technology is so complex that breakdowns are the norm , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel , whose country - europe 's biggest economy - has decided to phase out nuclear power .
austria , where voters rejected nuclear power in a 1978 referendum , slammed slovenia for initially filing a mislabeled accident report to its neighbors .
in italy , which also borders slovenia , leaders dismissed the scare as alarmist and said their country 's nuclear revival was firm .
" there will be no turning back , " economic development minister claudio scajola said .
" we have to go forward , because our country , and the entire planet , need energy . "
further north , slovaks and czechs are among the biggest supporters of nuclear power .
yet next-door austria regularly condemns their reactors as safety threats .
europeans want to see less nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of europe are against their governments ' plans one third of eu electricity comes from nuclear energy .
with eu officials saying that half of europe 's power plants need replacement by 2030 , polls show that most europeans want less , not more , nuclear .
a 2007 poll found that while most eu citizens expected energy prices to rise , 61 per cent wanted a smaller share for nuclear power .
yet even slovenia - population 2 million - is considering building a second reactor .

the 8 percent increase marked the biggest ever one-day surge . " if we leave this situation as it is , it could lead to a recession of the world economy , " japan 's energy minister akira amari said on sunday in an opening address .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 08.06.2008 nuclear power returns despite safety scares and opposition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of nuclear reactors is increasing across the globe despite concerns nuclear power is on the advance worldwide , and a recent safety scare in europe is highly unlikely to stop it .
concerns about energy security are driving the renaissance . nearly 440 nuclear reactors churn out electricity across the globe and more than 30 new plants are being built as the world 's energy appetite grows and oil prices soar .
russia , china and india are leading the way in new construction .
in the european union , a push by eastern nations saddled with soviet- era reactors is fuelling tension with anti-nuclear eu nations .
in western europe , the balance is shifting after prime minister silvio berlusconi 's new government said in may it plans to relaunch nuclear power in italy , 21 years after a referendum sparked by the chernobyl disaster outlawed it .
" only a few years ago , supporters of nuclear energy were viewed as witches , " slovakian prime minister robert fico said last month .
" it is clear ... that without nuclear we will be unable to ensure energy security in europe . "
slovakia , one of europe 's fastest-growing economies , is a case in point . under its deal to enter the eu in 2004 , one communist-era reactor at the jaslovske bohunice plant shut down in 2006 and the other is slated to close by 2009 .
to make up the shortfall and feed economic growth , slovakia wants to get two , possibly three , new nuclear plants online over the next few years .
" a war for access to energy sources has started - a war for investment opportunities , " fico said .
nuclear power seen as greener alternative to oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear is seen as the greener alternative to fossil fuels for ex-communist eastern europe , limiting dependence on russian oil and gas is a big factor .
and as eu governments jointly seek to fight global warming , nuclear power is increasingly attractive because it emits almost no greenhouse gases .
france , which gets more than three-quarters of its electricity from nuclear plants , plans to add another one .
finland wants to build a fifth reactor .
bulgaria shut down four of six units at its soviet-era kozloduy plant under pressure from the eu before joining the bloc last year .
but two new reactors are to be finished by 2014 at belene , across the danube river from romania .
energy fears are particularly strong in the baltics .
lithuania 's hefty 1,185-megawatt ignalina plant , which uses a design similar to chernobyl and supplies nearly 70 per cent of the small nation 's electricity , is slated to close by the end of 2009 .
lithuania , latvia , estonia and poland are talking about building a new plant together .
not that nuclear power is suddenly getting a free ride .
safety concerns divide opinion but do n't slow return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krsko reactor had to be shut down recently when a coolant leak at slovenia 's krsko plant wednesday led to an alert to all 27 eu nations , rifts between supporters and foes opened up quickly .
" this technology is so complex that breakdowns are the norm , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel , whose country - europe 's biggest economy - has decided to phase out nuclear power .
austria , where voters rejected nuclear power in a 1978 referendum , slammed slovenia for initially filing a mislabeled accident report to its neighbors .
in italy , which also borders slovenia , leaders dismissed the scare as alarmist and said their country 's nuclear revival was firm .
" there will be no turning back , " economic development minister claudio scajola said .
" we have to go forward , because our country , and the entire planet , need energy . "
further north , slovaks and czechs are among the biggest supporters of nuclear power .
yet next-door austria regularly condemns their reactors as safety threats .
europeans want to see less nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of europe are against their governments ' plans one third of eu electricity comes from nuclear energy .
with eu officials saying that half of europe 's power plants need replacement by 2030 , polls show that most europeans want less , not more , nuclear .
a 2007 poll found that while most eu citizens expected energy prices to rise , 61 per cent wanted a smaller share for nuclear power .
yet even slovenia - population 2 million - is considering building a second reactor .
its current western-built unit released no radioactivity during wednesday 's breakdown , which was ranked as a minor mishap .
hans-holger rogner , an expert at the un international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said he doubts the public will long remember .
other factors are set to play a bigger role : the expense and long lead times of building nuclear plants , or possible shortages of uranium , the metal used to make reactor fuel .
" right now , i see the pendulum swinging toward nuclear energy , " rogner told reporters .
" but it can also reverse course . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de slovenia says nuclear incident was not dangerous slovenia reassured eu nations on thursday that a water leak at its krsko nuclear plant , which sparked alarm across the bloc , posed no danger and that the plant would resume operations next week .
-lrb- 05.06.2008 -rrb- turkey 's nuclear power plans draw outrage plans to build several new nuclear power plants have come up against hefty protest in turkey , which is still suffering the effects of the 1986 chernobyl meltdown .
turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility .
-lrb- 23.05.2008 -rrb- europeans split over nuclear power and energy strategy ahead of a two-day european nuclear energy forum meeting , dw-world.de spoke to both sides of the debate over whether germany should stick to its total phase-out of nuclear power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 08.06.2008 nuclear power returns despite safety scares and opposition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of nuclear reactors is increasing across the globe despite concerns nuclear power is on the advance worldwide , and a recent safety scare in europe is highly unlikely to stop it .
concerns about energy security are driving the renaissance . nearly 440 nuclear reactors churn out electricity across the globe and more than 30 new plants are being built as the world 's energy appetite grows and oil prices soar .
russia , china and india are leading the way in new construction .
in the european union , a push by eastern nations saddled with soviet- era reactors is fuelling tension with anti-nuclear eu nations .
in western europe , the balance is shifting after prime minister silvio berlusconi 's new government said in may it plans to relaunch nuclear power in italy , 21 years after a referendum sparked by the chernobyl disaster outlawed it .
" only a few years ago , supporters of nuclear energy were viewed as witches , " slovakian prime minister robert fico said last month .
" it is clear ... that without nuclear we will be unable to ensure energy security in europe . "
slovakia , one of europe 's fastest-growing economies , is a case in point . under its deal to enter the eu in 2004 , one communist-era reactor at the jaslovske bohunice plant shut down in 2006 and the other is slated to close by 2009 .
to make up the shortfall and feed economic growth , slovakia wants to get two , possibly three , new nuclear plants online over the next few years .
" a war for access to energy sources has started - a war for investment opportunities , " fico said .
nuclear power seen as greener alternative to oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear is seen as the greener alternative to fossil fuels for ex-communist eastern europe , limiting dependence on russian oil and gas is a big factor .
and as eu governments jointly seek to fight global warming , nuclear power is increasingly attractive because it emits almost no greenhouse gases .
france , which gets more than three-quarters of its electricity from nuclear plants , plans to add another one .
finland wants to build a fifth reactor .
bulgaria shut down four of six units at its soviet-era kozloduy plant under pressure from the eu before joining the bloc last year .
but two new reactors are to be finished by 2014 at belene , across the danube river from romania .
energy fears are particularly strong in the baltics .
lithuania 's hefty 1,185-megawatt ignalina plant , which uses a design similar to chernobyl and supplies nearly 70 per cent of the small nation 's electricity , is slated to close by the end of 2009 .
lithuania , latvia , estonia and poland are talking about building a new plant together .
not that nuclear power is suddenly getting a free ride .
safety concerns divide opinion but do n't slow return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krsko reactor had to be shut down recently when a coolant leak at slovenia 's krsko plant wednesday led to an alert to all 27 eu nations , rifts between supporters and foes opened up quickly .
" this technology is so complex that breakdowns are the norm , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel , whose country - europe 's biggest economy - has decided to phase out nuclear power .
austria , where voters rejected nuclear power in a 1978 referendum , slammed slovenia for initially filing a mislabeled accident report to its neighbors .
in italy , which also borders slovenia , leaders dismissed the scare as alarmist and said their country 's nuclear revival was firm .
" there will be no turning back , " economic development minister claudio scajola said .
" we have to go forward , because our country , and the entire planet , need energy . "
further north , slovaks and czechs are among the biggest supporters of nuclear power .
yet next-door austria regularly condemns their reactors as safety threats .
europeans want to see less nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of europe are against their governments ' plans one third of eu electricity comes from nuclear energy .
with eu officials saying that half of europe 's power plants need replacement by 2030 , polls show that most europeans want less , not more , nuclear .
a 2007 poll found that while most eu citizens expected energy prices to rise , 61 per cent wanted a smaller share for nuclear power .
yet even slovenia - population 2 million - is considering building a second reactor .
its current western-built unit released no radioactivity during wednesday 's breakdown , which was ranked as a minor mishap .
hans-holger rogner , an expert at the un international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said he doubts the public will long remember .
other factors are set to play a bigger role : the expense and long lead times of building nuclear plants , or possible shortages of uranium , the metal used to make reactor fuel .
" right now , i see the pendulum swinging toward nuclear energy , " rogner told reporters .
" but it can also reverse course . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de slovenia says nuclear incident was not dangerous slovenia reassured eu nations on thursday that a water leak at its krsko nuclear plant , which sparked alarm across the bloc , posed no danger and that the plant would resume operations next week .
-lrb- 05.06.2008 -rrb- turkey 's nuclear power plans draw outrage plans to build several new nuclear power plants have come up against hefty protest in turkey , which is still suffering the effects of the 1986 chernobyl meltdown .
turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility .

concerns about energy security are driving the renaissance . nearly 440 nuclear reactors churn out electricity across the globe and more than 30 new plants are being built as the world 's energy appetite grows and oil prices soar .
russia , china and india are leading the way in new construction .
in the european union , a push by eastern nations saddled with soviet- era reactors is fuelling tension with anti-nuclear eu nations .
in western europe , the balance is shifting after prime minister silvio berlusconi 's new government said in may it plans to relaunch nuclear power in italy , 21 years after a referendum sparked by the chernobyl disaster outlawed it .
" only a few years ago , supporters of nuclear energy were viewed as witches , " slovakian prime minister robert fico said last month .
" it is clear ... that without nuclear we will be unable to ensure energy security in europe . "
slovakia , one of europe 's fastest-growing economies , is a case in point . under its deal to enter the eu in 2004 , one communist-era reactor at the jaslovske bohunice plant shut down in 2006 and the other is slated to close by 2009 .
to make up the shortfall and feed economic growth , slovakia wants to get two , possibly three , new nuclear plants online over the next few years .
" a war for access to energy sources has started - a war for investment opportunities , " fico said .
nuclear power seen as greener alternative to oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear is seen as the greener alternative to fossil fuels for ex-communist eastern europe , limiting dependence on russian oil and gas is a big factor .
and as eu governments jointly seek to fight global warming , nuclear power is increasingly attractive because it emits almost no greenhouse gases .
france , which gets more than three-quarters of its electricity from nuclear plants , plans to add another one .
finland wants to build a fifth reactor .
bulgaria shut down four of six units at its soviet-era kozloduy plant under pressure from the eu before joining the bloc last year .
but two new reactors are to be finished by 2014 at belene , across the danube river from romania .
energy fears are particularly strong in the baltics .
lithuania 's hefty 1,185-megawatt ignalina plant , which uses a design similar to chernobyl and supplies nearly 70 per cent of the small nation 's electricity , is slated to close by the end of 2009 .
lithuania , latvia , estonia and poland are talking about building a new plant together .
not that nuclear power is suddenly getting a free ride .
safety concerns divide opinion but do n't slow return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krsko reactor had to be shut down recently when a coolant leak at slovenia 's krsko plant wednesday led to an alert to all 27 eu nations , rifts between supporters and foes opened up quickly .
" this technology is so complex that breakdowns are the norm , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel , whose country - europe 's biggest economy - has decided to phase out nuclear power .
austria , where voters rejected nuclear power in a 1978 referendum , slammed slovenia for initially filing a mislabeled accident report to its neighbors .
in italy , which also borders slovenia , leaders dismissed the scare as alarmist and said their country 's nuclear revival was firm .
" there will be no turning back , " economic development minister claudio scajola said .
" we have to go forward , because our country , and the entire planet , need energy . "
further north , slovaks and czechs are among the biggest supporters of nuclear power .
yet next-door austria regularly condemns their reactors as safety threats .
europeans want to see less nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of europe are against their governments ' plans one third of eu electricity comes from nuclear energy .
with eu officials saying that half of europe 's power plants need replacement by 2030 , polls show that most europeans want less , not more , nuclear .
a 2007 poll found that while most eu citizens expected energy prices to rise , 61 per cent wanted a smaller share for nuclear power .
yet even slovenia - population 2 million - is considering building a second reactor .
its current western-built unit released no radioactivity during wednesday 's breakdown , which was ranked as a minor mishap .
hans-holger rogner , an expert at the un international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said he doubts the public will long remember .
other factors are set to play a bigger role : the expense and long lead times of building nuclear plants , or possible shortages of uranium , the metal used to make reactor fuel .
" right now , i see the pendulum swinging toward nuclear energy , " rogner told reporters .

" we played very well after starting poorly . " we were very nervous at first , but then came into the game .

concerns about energy security are driving the renaissance . nearly 440 nuclear reactors churn out electricity across the globe and more than 30 new plants are being built as the world 's energy appetite grows and oil prices soar .
russia , china and india are leading the way in new construction .
in the european union , a push by eastern nations saddled with soviet- era reactors is fuelling tension with anti-nuclear eu nations .
in western europe , the balance is shifting after prime minister silvio berlusconi 's new government said in may it plans to relaunch nuclear power in italy , 21 years after a referendum sparked by the chernobyl disaster outlawed it .
" only a few years ago , supporters of nuclear energy were viewed as witches , " slovakian prime minister robert fico said last month .
" it is clear ... that without nuclear we will be unable to ensure energy security in europe . "
slovakia , one of europe 's fastest-growing economies , is a case in point . under its deal to enter the eu in 2004 , one communist-era reactor at the jaslovske bohunice plant shut down in 2006 and the other is slated to close by 2009 .
to make up the shortfall and feed economic growth , slovakia wants to get two , possibly three , new nuclear plants online over the next few years .
" a war for access to energy sources has started - a war for investment opportunities , " fico said .
nuclear power seen as greener alternative to oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear is seen as the greener alternative to fossil fuels for ex-communist eastern europe , limiting dependence on russian oil and gas is a big factor .
and as eu governments jointly seek to fight global warming , nuclear power is increasingly attractive because it emits almost no greenhouse gases .
france , which gets more than three-quarters of its electricity from nuclear plants , plans to add another one .
finland wants to build a fifth reactor .
bulgaria shut down four of six units at its soviet-era kozloduy plant under pressure from the eu before joining the bloc last year .
but two new reactors are to be finished by 2014 at belene , across the danube river from romania .
energy fears are particularly strong in the baltics .
lithuania 's hefty 1,185-megawatt ignalina plant , which uses a design similar to chernobyl and supplies nearly 70 per cent of the small nation 's electricity , is slated to close by the end of 2009 .
lithuania , latvia , estonia and poland are talking about building a new plant together .
not that nuclear power is suddenly getting a free ride .
safety concerns divide opinion but do n't slow return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krsko reactor had to be shut down recently when a coolant leak at slovenia 's krsko plant wednesday led to an alert to all 27 eu nations , rifts between supporters and foes opened up quickly .
" this technology is so complex that breakdowns are the norm , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel , whose country - europe 's biggest economy - has decided to phase out nuclear power .
austria , where voters rejected nuclear power in a 1978 referendum , slammed slovenia for initially filing a mislabeled accident report to its neighbors .
in italy , which also borders slovenia , leaders dismissed the scare as alarmist and said their country 's nuclear revival was firm .
" there will be no turning back , " economic development minister claudio scajola said .
" we have to go forward , because our country , and the entire planet , need energy . "
further north , slovaks and czechs are among the biggest supporters of nuclear power .
yet next-door austria regularly condemns their reactors as safety threats .
europeans want to see less nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of europe are against their governments ' plans one third of eu electricity comes from nuclear energy .
with eu officials saying that half of europe 's power plants need replacement by 2030 , polls show that most europeans want less , not more , nuclear .
a 2007 poll found that while most eu citizens expected energy prices to rise , 61 per cent wanted a smaller share for nuclear power .
yet even slovenia - population 2 million - is considering building a second reactor .
its current western-built unit released no radioactivity during wednesday 's breakdown , which was ranked as a minor mishap .
hans-holger rogner , an expert at the un international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said he doubts the public will long remember .
other factors are set to play a bigger role : the expense and long lead times of building nuclear plants , or possible shortages of uranium , the metal used to make reactor fuel .
" right now , i see the pendulum swinging toward nuclear energy , " rogner told reporters .

concerns about energy security are driving the renaissance . nearly 440 nuclear reactors churn out electricity across the globe and more than 30 new plants are being built as the world 's energy appetite grows and oil prices soar .
russia , china and india are leading the way in new construction .
in the european union , a push by eastern nations saddled with soviet- era reactors is fuelling tension with anti-nuclear eu nations .
in western europe , the balance is shifting after prime minister silvio berlusconi 's new government said in may it plans to relaunch nuclear power in italy , 21 years after a referendum sparked by the chernobyl disaster outlawed it .
" only a few years ago , supporters of nuclear energy were viewed as witches , " slovakian prime minister robert fico said last month .
" it is clear ... that without nuclear we will be unable to ensure energy security in europe . "
slovakia , one of europe 's fastest-growing economies , is a case in point . under its deal to enter the eu in 2004 , one communist-era reactor at the jaslovske bohunice plant shut down in 2006 and the other is slated to close by 2009 .

14 -rrb- spot-kick did not bring the flood of goals some commentators expected luka modric 's fourth minute penalty gave croatia victory over austria in vienna sunday , june 8 but slaven bilic 's much-fancied side had to survive long periods of austrian dominance before the win was theirs . euro 2008 co-hosts austria kicked off their campaign with an undeserved 1-0 defeat at home in vienna to croatia on sunday , in the first group b game . croatia were technically superior to josef hickersberger 's team , but were relieved to hear the final whistle after surviving a spirited second-half austrian frontal assault . austria made a nervous start , as if overwhelmed by the responsibility of being hosts - and aware of their own technical inferiority . hickerersberger started with a cautious 5-4-1 formation . penalty adds to austrian nerves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia failed to add to their early opener however , his plans went up in smoke after just four minutes , when luka modric opened the scoring from the penalty spot after rene aufhauser had clumsily clattered into croatia striker ivica olic . croatia should have put austria out of their misery in the first half , but olic and mladen petric squandered good chances . austria slowly came out of their defensive shell but could only create danger with free-kicks and high centers . austria continued their direct assault in the second half , livening up the capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion with a series of corners and goalmouth scrambles . the ageless ivica vastic came off the bench in the second half to finally give the austrian attack a touch of quality . fellow sub umit korkmaz forced a sharp save out of croatia keeper stipe pletikosa with just four minutes left . chances come thick and fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far from imploding , austria pushed croatia all the way in stoppage time , with tired croatia desperate to hear the whistle , roman kienast glanced a high header just wide of pletikosa 's far post . a draw would have been a fairer result than a croatia win . austrian defender martin stranzl said that they still believed they stood a chance to advance to the next round .

14 -rrb- spot-kick did not bring the flood of goals some commentators expected luka modric 's fourth minute penalty gave croatia victory over austria in vienna sunday , june 8 but slaven bilic 's much-fancied side had to survive long periods of austrian dominance before the win was theirs . euro 2008 co-hosts austria kicked off their campaign with an undeserved 1-0 defeat at home in vienna to croatia on sunday , in the first group b game . croatia were technically superior to josef hickersberger 's team , but were relieved to hear the final whistle after surviving a spirited second-half austrian frontal assault . austria made a nervous start , as if overwhelmed by the responsibility of being hosts - and aware of their own technical inferiority . hickerersberger started with a cautious 5-4-1 formation . penalty adds to austrian nerves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia failed to add to their early opener however , his plans went up in smoke after just four minutes , when luka modric opened the scoring from the penalty spot after rene aufhauser had clumsily clattered into croatia striker ivica olic . croatia should have put austria out of their misery in the first half , but olic and mladen petric squandered good chances . austria slowly came out of their defensive shell but could only create danger with free-kicks and high centers . austria continued their direct assault in the second half , livening up the capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion with a series of corners and goalmouth scrambles . the ageless ivica vastic came off the bench in the second half to finally give the austrian attack a touch of quality . fellow sub umit korkmaz forced a sharp save out of croatia keeper stipe pletikosa with just four minutes left . chances come thick and fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far from imploding , austria pushed croatia all the way in stoppage time , with tired croatia desperate to hear the whistle , roman kienast glanced a high header just wide of pletikosa 's far post . a draw would have been a fairer result than a croatia win . austrian defender martin stranzl said that they still believed they stood a chance to advance to the next round .
" we played very well after starting poorly . " we were very nervous at first , but then came into the game .

" basically no one is 100 percent satisfied with this ball , " andreas koepke , germany 's goalkeeper-coach told reporters at the german base camp in tenero , switzerland , on saturday , june 7 .
germany goalkeeper jens lehmann had repeatedly complained that it was difficult to catch and had a tendency to swirl .
co-host austria 's goalkeeper alexander manninger and czech goalie petr cech also expressed their dissatisfaction with the fast ball which is likely to make a goalkeeper 's life very difficult during the three-week tournament .

in this year alone , 72 people have died in incidents of this kind .
sociologists also blame the media in part for the trend . a study by the information and analysis center sowa revealed that one in two russians is concerned about the number of immigrants in russian cities .
in the past , citizens from the caucasus were the primary targets of hostility , but now immigrants from central asian countries are increasingly being victimized . the sowa researchers partly blame the country 's media for this development .
the investigation showed that reporting about immigrants was almost entirely negative .

" but over the last two years media reports about immigrants have been hostile .
that 's a very dangerous tendency , " she added .
statistics collected by the moscow center for human rights indicate that 72 people were killed in connection with racist attacks in the first five months of this year , compared to a total of 50 in 2007 .
center head alexander brod said that there were 126 attacks in total - with 137 injuries also occurring in the course of the violence .
the majority of the incidents took place in moscow and st. petersburg .
rise in central asian victims immigrants from central asian states were most frequently the target of attack .
this year 's fatalities included 12 uzbek , 9 kyrgyz and six tajik nationals .
citizens from these countries also accounted for a large number of the injuries with 23 tajiks , 10 uzbeks and five people from kyrgyzstan being harmed in racially motivated attacks .
six people from the caucasus republic of azerbaijan were also killed this year .

it 's always difficult - you never know where you are before the first game of a tournament .
i think we deserved victory .
from the start we were aggressive , " the chelsea star told the bbc . the poles were making their european championship debut , but are still yet to beat germany in 16 meetings between the sides since 1933 with the germans now claiming 12 wins with four draws between the neighbors . beenhakker had opted for five in midfield with ebi smolarek as the lone striker up front for poland . loew had gone for a traditional 4-4-2 formation , keeping midfielder bastian schweinsteiger - a star of the 2006 world cup - on the bench until half-time playing podolski behind the two german strikers . the move paid off as podolski gave germany an extra attacking option supporting front men miroslav klose , the top scorer at the last world cup , who was partnering vfb stuttgart hot-shot mario gomez up front . striking triumverate come up with the goods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski scored both goals from a new midfield role after both sides squandered early chances , the trio combined to give germany the break through they craved on 20 minutes . gomez flicked the ball over the defense for klose to draw the goalkeeper before giving his bayern munich team-mate podolski a simple tap in on 20 minutes past poland 's celtic goalkeeper artur boruc . poland 's best chance of the first half - and ultimately the game - came when midfielder wojciech lobodzinski put in a superb pass , but maciej zurawski pulled his shot wide .
polish striker smolarek picked up the first booking on 40 minutes when he tripped per mertesacker . during the half-time break , beenhakker swapped his captain maciej zurawski for brazilian-born roger guerreiro , but he made little impact and lobodzinski earned poland 's second yellow card on 64 minutes for tripping podolski . poldi 's double comes with little celebration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scorer remains reserved as his team-mates celebrate germany were dominating by this stage and when the ball fell to podolski on 72 minutes he drove his shot into the top corner of the net to give his side some breathing space . as with his first goal , podolski kept his emotions in check as not to celebrate to wildly his goals against his birth nation .
with a large family watching back in poland , poldi 's restraint was well-received by both sets of fans . as the game wore on , german goalkeeper jens lehmann produced a string of saves as poland applied some late pressure , but his defense held . the result means group b 's two unbeaten sides will meet thursday when germany return here to face croatia . ballack said he was looking forward to playing croatia but cautioned : " i think it 's an open game - both teams are very strong .

" we want to end this series as soon as possible , ” loew said .
" i believe that we have a team that is capable of winning this first match .
if we perform to our capabilities then we will have a team that will take charge and dictate the rhythm . "
loew refused to reveal his starting lineup as some uncertainty remains around bayern munich players bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski .
all that loew was prepared to say was that " schweinsteiger has improved compared to the beginning of the week . "

this lineup , which features captain michael ballack and frings as key midfielders , only underlines that germany are out to attack from the outset and to spare themselves the nerves they suffered at the world cup two years ago when they required an injury-time winner from oliver neuville to beat the poles .
a good win would also send a clear warning to the other group opponents austria and croatia , and to the other teams as well - looking ahead to the june 29 final in vienna .
loew ultimately has his sights set on the title but also warned that " it is the toughest tournament in the world " with little separating the teams .

polish-born strikers germany 's main weapon loew will be hoping polish-born striker klose will be germany ’ s main weapon in that quest . the bayern munich striker , who was born in oppeln , poland , was top scorer at the 2006 world cup and after winning germany 's domestic treble last season he wants to translate domestic success to the european stage . with 39 goals and 75 caps , klose will turn 30 on monday with loew insisting he is in the form of his life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been in consistently good form for germany " miroslav has left a fantastic impression in training , i have never seen him that fit , that agile and strong , " said loew .

concerns about energy security are driving the renaissance . nearly 440 nuclear reactors churn out electricity across the globe and more than 30 new plants are being built as the world 's energy appetite grows and oil prices soar .
russia , china and india are leading the way in new construction .
in the european union , a push by eastern nations saddled with soviet- era reactors is fuelling tension with anti-nuclear eu nations .
in western europe , the balance is shifting after prime minister silvio berlusconi 's new government said in may it plans to relaunch nuclear power in italy , 21 years after a referendum sparked by the chernobyl disaster outlawed it .
" only a few years ago , supporters of nuclear energy were viewed as witches , " slovakian prime minister robert fico said last month .
" it is clear ... that without nuclear we will be unable to ensure energy security in europe . "
slovakia , one of europe 's fastest-growing economies , is a case in point . under its deal to enter the eu in 2004 , one communist-era reactor at the jaslovske bohunice plant shut down in 2006 and the other is slated to close by 2009 .
to make up the shortfall and feed economic growth , slovakia wants to get two , possibly three , new nuclear plants online over the next few years .
" a war for access to energy sources has started - a war for investment opportunities , " fico said .

energy fears are particularly strong in the baltics .
lithuania 's hefty 1,185-megawatt ignalina plant , which uses a design similar to chernobyl and supplies nearly 70 per cent of the small nation 's electricity , is slated to close by the end of 2009 .

" this technology is so complex that breakdowns are the norm , " said german environment minister sigmar gabriel , whose country - europe 's biggest economy - has decided to phase out nuclear power .
austria , where voters rejected nuclear power in a 1978 referendum , slammed slovenia for initially filing a mislabeled accident report to its neighbors .
in italy , which also borders slovenia , leaders dismissed the scare as alarmist and said their country 's nuclear revival was firm .
" there will be no turning back , " economic development minister claudio scajola said .
" we have to go forward , because our country , and the entire planet , need energy . "
further north , slovaks and czechs are among the biggest supporters of nuclear power .

" basically no one is 100 percent satisfied with this ball , " andreas koepke , germany 's goalkeeper-coach told reporters at the german base camp in tenero , switzerland , on saturday , june 7 .
germany goalkeeper jens lehmann had repeatedly complained that it was difficult to catch and had a tendency to swirl .
co-host austria 's goalkeeper alexander manninger and czech goalie petr cech also expressed their dissatisfaction with the fast ball which is likely to make a goalkeeper 's life very difficult during the three-week tournament .
" this ball is not the keeper 's friend , " manninger said .
players however may see things a little different .
outfield stars eager to get to grips with europass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " look out lads , that thing could go anywhere " " for players , the ball is great , " germany midfielder thorsten frings said .
" there will be many more goals from a greater distance .
if you hit it right , it really goes off . "
yes , for keepers the ball presented a difficulty , frings admitted , but " we 'll get this sorted , " he said optimistically .
one thing field players and goalkeepers seem to agree on : the europass may change the way the game is played at this tournament .
" you have to be more awake with this ball , " koepke said .
the defense , for one , had to be more on the ball - so to speak .
as keepers were more likely to avoid the risk of catching this ball and will rather block it , defenders will have to be fully alert in those potentially risky situations and try to get the ball before the other team 's forwards , he explained .
at the same time , the forwards would of course try and get in their second chance .
germany 's goalies ready to face " tricky customer " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one minute it was there , coach , the next it was n't " using the europass brought some changes for training germany 's goalkeepers , koepke said .
field players were included in goalkeeper training routines to help the keepers adjust to the ball 's properties .
" it is pointless to lament this , " koepke said , adding that his team had tried to make the best of it .
" -lrb- but -rrb- i do n't think we will get more goals because the ball swirls , " koepke said .
adidas , which worked two years on the development of the ball , did not see such problems .
" the ball 's new surface structure allows players to control and direct it perfectly in all weather conditions , " the company said at the ball 's presentation .
its new surface texture on the outer skin guaranteed " optimum grip between ball and boot , " as well as better grip between glove and ball for goalkeepers . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mark hannaby the politics show wales cardiff bay : in danger of acquiring slum status ?
will the area housing wales ' national assembly and millennium centre become a ' slum of the future ' ?
cardiff bay 's redevelopment symbolised growth and success .
however , fears are mounting that the area has been overdeveloped .
it contains hundreds of empty flats proving very difficult to sell or rent and with over 9,000 more apartments on the way across the city , that situation could get worse .
academic view professor john punter is professor of urban design at cardiff university .
he said : " there are an enormous number of apartments in the bay at the moment which are unlet and unoccupied .
" we know we 've been building something like 1250 apartments a year .
i would suggest that probably one third to one half of those are unoccupied .
" i think some of them could be the slums of the future , especially the ones which are more remote , more poorly designed . "
limited services it is not only empty properties that work against community development .
professor punter argues planners did not incorporate vital amenities .
people have to drive to access services .
he says much of the accommodation is not affordable housing and is not ideal for families , despite 4,500 families in cardiff being on housing waiting lists .
many of professor punter 's concerns are echoed by labour am for cardiff south and penarth lorraine barrett .
she said : " i 've got real concerns about no community being built up over the years and i think that can bring with it that sort of ghost town sort of feel .
" i think we could be looking at the slums of the future . "
social problems ?
the fear is that when flats lie empty , the value and condition of properties declines .
in the absence of amenities and a strong sense of community , it is argued the conditions are in place for social problems to proliferate .
lorraine barrett said : " i 'm concerned that when you 've got empty properties , the landlords may well just rent them out to a wide range of people who may not be suited to that type of living .
" i think we could be storing up some social problems for the future . "
prices falling current falls in property values are all too apparent in cardiff bay .
cardiff estate agent michael jones says selling or renting property there is now extremely difficult .
those who do manage to offload their apartments sustain extraordinary losses .
mr jones said he knows of one bay property bought for £ 260,000 two years ago which recently sold for £ 180,000 .
new developments but some developers remain confident that , once current economic gloom lifts , cardiff bay will grow and prosper .
chris hamilton is managing director of the bay pointe development , a plan to build wales ' tallest development in cardiff bay 's sports village .
it will be completed by 2016 and will feature 1800 apartments in ten buildings , including two towers - one of them 403 feet high .
mr hamilton said : " i think cardiff bay was a blot on the landscape in the past .
it is certainly not going to be in the future . "
the leader of cardiff council , cllr rodney berman , will appear on sunday 's politics show , on bbc1 wales at 12 noon , to discuss this issue .

the home affairs select committee called for proper safeguards on the plans for compulsory id cards to stop " function creep " threatening privacy .
it wants a guarantee the scheme will not be expanded without mps ' approval .
the ministry of justice said it had to balance protecting the public with protecting a right to privacy .
the home secretary jacqui smith told bbc one 's andrew marr show that many people welcomed the use of devices such as cctv cameras .
" i know that when as it was then , the labour-controlled council in my constituency , funded cctv cameras in the town centre to help to protect people when they wanted to go out and have a night out without being blighted by anti-social behaviour , people supported it .
" so i know for example with the dna database that tens of thousands of crimes have been solved because of the use of the dna database . "
' ambiguity ' the national identity scheme is due to start rolling out later this year , and will eventually hold details on everyone in britain over the age of 16 .
the select committee said in a report : " it should collect only what is essential , to be stored only for as long as is necessary .
" we are concerned ... about the potential for ' function creep ' in terms of the surveillance potential of the national identity scheme .
" any ambiguity about the objectives of the scheme puts in jeopardy the public 's trust in the scheme itself and in the government 's ability to run it . "
the committee said it accepted the government 's assurance that the scheme would not be used as a surveillance tool .
however , " we seek the further assurance that any initiative to broaden the scope of the scheme will only be proposed after consulting the information commissioner and on the basis that proposals will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny in draft form , " it said .
committee chairman keith vaz said there could be " potentially disastrous consequences " if data was mishandled .
have your say " id cards are not a problem in my opinion .
the main problem is the government spying on people who have n't done anything . "
fj , gloucestershire send us your comments therefore , he said , the government should draw up a " broad outline of contingency plans " to deal with potential security breaches in the id cards programme .
the report referred to the loss of two discs containing the personal details of 25m people last year .
" the minister 's assurances that the government has learned lessons , though welcome , are not sufficient to reassure us or , we suspect , the public , " it said .
the report also urged the government to set up new controls on the national dna database to prevent " unnecessary invasions of privacy " .
it said the system should be changed to make it easier for people whose dna is on the system to challenge its retention .
' public trust ' mr vaz said : " what we are calling for is an overall principle of ' least data , for least time ' .
" the public do n't have much choice over the data held on them by public bodies so they must be confident about how it is being collected , stored and used , otherwise we are in danger of becoming a surveillance society . "
" the government takes the protection of personal data extremely seriously " ministry of justice spokesman information commissioner richard thomas said he welcomed the report .
" it is essential that positive action is taken to ensure the potential risks of a surveillance society never manifest themselves in this country , " mr thomas said .
" every possible step must be taken to ensure public trust in the way that personal information is collected and stored . "
the report also called for a public consultation on the powers of public bodies , such as councils , to use surveillance powers .

by ben wright bbc news political correspondent mr brown is dealing with labour opponents on several fronts rebellion .
it 's the word of the moment in westminster .
in this world of tightly whipped discipline , any deviation from the party line is seen as a courageous act of career-crushing defiance .
but rebels are everywhere right now .
well , actually , they are everywhere in the labour party .
the rebels do not want to overthrow the government but they do want to change its policies .
their great recent triumph was the 10 pence tax u-turn and their pin-up is frank field , the labour mp who showed what could be done with a good argument and a clever campaign .
and now the rebels have organised on other issues : the government 's plan to increase vehicle excise duty -lrb- retrospectively -rrb- on the most polluting cars ; its proposals to reform the planning system ; and of course its plans to increase detention without charge for terror suspects up to 42 days .
and , they reason , if the government is in the mood to appease bolshie backbenchers on the issue of 10p tax , why not these ?
pile-up potential when gordon brown 's working majority is 66 and poll ratings are plunging , he can not afford damaging defeats in the commons .
this coming week had pile-up potential , with one controversial policy shunting into the next .
i certainly hope it -lsb- gets through -rsb- , because i believe it is the right thing to do jacqui smith on terror detention plan mi5 ' has not asked for 42 days ' labour rebel watch monday promised a key vote on the planning bill - a dull-sounding piece of legislation but with big significance .
many labour mps are angry about what they see as a lack of political accountability in the government 's plans for a new planning system .
but last week the bill was suddenly pulled from the parliamentary schedule .
one of the potential rebels , john grogan , said : " either the government does n't want two controversial votes in one week or it 's preparing concessions to meet backbench concerns .
it 's got to be one or the other . "
anxiety would-be rebels tend to reveal their identities by signing early day motions , in-house parliamentary petitions that do not have any power to change policy but do reveal what mps are getting cross about .
ronnie campbell started one asking the government to reconsider its vehicle excise duty policy and 53 mps have signed it .
mr campbell has got a meeting with the chancellor next week to talk though his concerns .
it is a rebellion the government is anxious to stall .
but the proposal that is really getting rebel watchers excited is contained in the counter-terrorism bill .
the house of commons votes on wednesday on extending 28-day detention limit to 42 days - and the result remains impossible to call a flurry of new amendments that beef up the safeguards and stress the exceptional circumstances in which the power could be used has won over some labour mps such as keith vaz and martin salter .
but an unknown number of others remain opposed to the central principle of the plan .
of course , some of labour 's disgruntled mp are serial rebels , left-wingers who habitually vote against the government .
for others this is a bigger line to cross , particularly on a vote that - though not a confidence issue - carries the tag of being a major test of gordon brown 's authority .
a rebellion is one thing .
a rebellion that could dangerously wound an embattled prime minister is quite another .

by ben wright bbc news political correspondent mr brown is dealing with labour opponents on several fronts rebellion .
it 's the word of the moment in westminster .
in this world of tightly whipped discipline , any deviation from the party line is seen as a courageous act of career-crushing defiance .
but rebels are everywhere right now .
well , actually , they are everywhere in the labour party .
the rebels do not want to overthrow the government but they do want to change its policies .
their great recent triumph was the 10 pence tax u-turn and their pin-up is frank field , the labour mp who showed what could be done with a good argument and a clever campaign .
and now the rebels have organised on other issues : the government 's plan to increase vehicle excise duty -lrb- retrospectively -rrb- on the most polluting cars ; its proposals to reform the planning system ; and of course its plans to increase detention without charge for terror suspects up to 42 days .
and , they reason , if the government is in the mood to appease bolshie backbenchers on the issue of 10p tax , why not these ?
pile-up potential when gordon brown 's working majority is 66 and poll ratings are plunging , he can not afford damaging defeats in the commons .
this coming week had pile-up potential , with one controversial policy shunting into the next .
i certainly hope it -lsb- gets through -rsb- , because i believe it is the right thing to do jacqui smith on terror detention plan mi5 ' has not asked for 42 days ' labour rebel watch monday promised a key vote on the planning bill - a dull-sounding piece of legislation but with big significance .
many labour mps are angry about what they see as a lack of political accountability in the government 's plans for a new planning system .
but last week the bill was suddenly pulled from the parliamentary schedule .
one of the potential rebels , john grogan , said : " either the government does n't want two controversial votes in one week or it 's preparing concessions to meet backbench concerns .
it 's got to be one or the other . "
anxiety would-be rebels tend to reveal their identities by signing early day motions , in-house parliamentary petitions that do not have any power to change policy but do reveal what mps are getting cross about .
ronnie campbell started one asking the government to reconsider its vehicle excise duty policy and 53 mps have signed it .
mr campbell has got a meeting with the chancellor next week to talk though his concerns .
it is a rebellion the government is anxious to stall .
but the proposal that is really getting rebel watchers excited is contained in the counter-terrorism bill .
the house of commons votes on wednesday on extending 28-day detention limit to 42 days - and the result remains impossible to call a flurry of new amendments that beef up the safeguards and stress the exceptional circumstances in which the power could be used has won over some labour mps such as keith vaz and martin salter .
but an unknown number of others remain opposed to the central principle of the plan .
of course , some of labour 's disgruntled mp are serial rebels , left-wingers who habitually vote against the government .
for others this is a bigger line to cross , particularly on a vote that - though not a confidence issue - carries the tag of being a major test of gordon brown 's authority .
a rebellion is one thing .
a rebellion that could dangerously wound an embattled prime minister is quite another .

by ben wright bbc news political correspondent mr brown is dealing with labour opponents on several fronts rebellion .
it 's the word of the moment in westminster .
in this world of tightly whipped discipline , any deviation from the party line is seen as a courageous act of career-crushing defiance .
but rebels are everywhere right now .
well , actually , they are everywhere in the labour party .
the rebels do not want to overthrow the government but they do want to change its policies .
their great recent triumph was the 10 pence tax u-turn and their pin-up is frank field , the labour mp who showed what could be done with a good argument and a clever campaign .
and now the rebels have organised on other issues : the government 's plan to increase vehicle excise duty -lrb- retrospectively -rrb- on the most polluting cars ; its proposals to reform the planning system ; and of course its plans to increase detention without charge for terror suspects up to 42 days .
and , they reason , if the government is in the mood to appease bolshie backbenchers on the issue of 10p tax , why not these ?
pile-up potential when gordon brown 's working majority is 66 and poll ratings are plunging , he can not afford damaging defeats in the commons .
this coming week had pile-up potential , with one controversial policy shunting into the next .
i certainly hope it -lsb- gets through -rsb- , because i believe it is the right thing to do jacqui smith on terror detention plan mi5 ' has not asked for 42 days ' labour rebel watch monday promised a key vote on the planning bill - a dull-sounding piece of legislation but with big significance .
many labour mps are angry about what they see as a lack of political accountability in the government 's plans for a new planning system .
but last week the bill was suddenly pulled from the parliamentary schedule .
one of the potential rebels , john grogan , said : " either the government does n't want two controversial votes in one week or it 's preparing concessions to meet backbench concerns .
it 's got to be one or the other . "
anxiety would-be rebels tend to reveal their identities by signing early day motions , in-house parliamentary petitions that do not have any power to change policy but do reveal what mps are getting cross about .
ronnie campbell started one asking the government to reconsider its vehicle excise duty policy and 53 mps have signed it .
mr campbell has got a meeting with the chancellor next week to talk though his concerns .
it is a rebellion the government is anxious to stall .
but the proposal that is really getting rebel watchers excited is contained in the counter-terrorism bill .
the house of commons votes on wednesday on extending 28-day detention limit to 42 days - and the result remains impossible to call a flurry of new amendments that beef up the safeguards and stress the exceptional circumstances in which the power could be used has won over some labour mps such as keith vaz and martin salter .
but an unknown number of others remain opposed to the central principle of the plan .
of course , some of labour 's disgruntled mp are serial rebels , left-wingers who habitually vote against the government .
for others this is a bigger line to cross , particularly on a vote that - though not a confidence issue - carries the tag of being a major test of gordon brown 's authority .
a rebellion is one thing .
a rebellion that could dangerously wound an embattled prime minister is quite another .

but all that could be about to change , if you believe communities secretary hazel blears .
with representation comes taxation she is heralding an era of ' parish power ' and wants to see new town and parish councils established across the country as a means of re-invigorating local democracy .
with representation though - as many people are finding out - comes taxation .
in some areas , parish councils are taking on more and more responsibilities , and in turn , they are pushing up their part of the council tax - the parish precept .
no cap unlike other tiers of local government , parish and town councils are not capped , and so can put up the precept by as much as they like .
and some have done just that .
thurston parish council , in suffolk , put its council tax bill up 214 % .
it says this was a one off rise and designed largely to boost its cash reserves on the orders of the district auditor .
burnham parish council , in buckinghamshire , almost doubled its precept two years ago - largely as a one off charge to help finance its plans to refurbish or rebuild burnham park hall .
in letchworth garden city , in hertfordshire , the parish precept for this financial year has leapt by 206 % .
electorate upset and so upset are some residents that they want to see letchworth " de-parished " - that is the town council abolished , even though it was only established in 2005 .
a group of residents have now set up the organisation help - or help eliminate letchworth parish council - to rid themselves of what they see as an expensive and unnecessary extra layer of government .
matthew heaton , from help said : " everything is already covered by the district council and the county council .
" we 're paying for those services and they 're providing them perfectly well and we 're not keen to pay for another tier that will charge us again for the same services .
" we also see it as another layer of bureaucracy , and putting in another layer of bureaucracy is just unworkable . "
value for money the town council itself says it is good value for money and has many plans that will improve letchworth .
but it also needs funds - and time - to establish itself .
" we are a pennies , not a pounds council .
we are where democracy begins , not ends .
if you believe in community you have to take a leap of faith and handover money and power to our neighbourhoods " , says mayor philip ross .
many parish and town councils also argue that they are being forced to push up precepts to meet the extra obligations that are being placed on them by other councils further up the food chain - councils constrained in their spending by capping levels set by central government .
national examples in northumberland , several parish councils are considering taking over the running of their local libraries , currently owned and staffed by the county council .
in kirkham , in lancashire , the parish council there is looking at ways it can save the local swimming pool , which the district council says it may no longer be able to afford to keep open .
one option being considered is using parish council funds to help set up a community trust that would eventually run the pool .
bishop 's stortford town council , in hertfordshire , has already taken on services once provided at district level .
it runs one lot of public toilets in the town , and while the district council does provide some funding , the town council puts in money from the precept rather than risk them having to be closed due to a lack of cash .
funding should match function justin griggs , from the national association of local councils , admits that in some instances precepts have risen sharply , but points out that parish and town councils are doing much more , and need the funding to match their growing responsibilities .
" we 've seen 191 new parish councils created in the last 10 years in response to community demand .
" these are local people that are seeing gaps in service provision , seeing gaps in the representation and voice that 's provided to them , and they want an institution of local government that 's close to them to provide services , to respond to community needs and be their voice " , he said .

but all that could be about to change , if you believe communities secretary hazel blears .
with representation comes taxation she is heralding an era of ' parish power ' and wants to see new town and parish councils established across the country as a means of re-invigorating local democracy .
with representation though - as many people are finding out - comes taxation .
in some areas , parish councils are taking on more and more responsibilities , and in turn , they are pushing up their part of the council tax - the parish precept .
no cap unlike other tiers of local government , parish and town councils are not capped , and so can put up the precept by as much as they like .
and some have done just that .
thurston parish council , in suffolk , put its council tax bill up 214 % .
it says this was a one off rise and designed largely to boost its cash reserves on the orders of the district auditor .
burnham parish council , in buckinghamshire , almost doubled its precept two years ago - largely as a one off charge to help finance its plans to refurbish or rebuild burnham park hall .
in letchworth garden city , in hertfordshire , the parish precept for this financial year has leapt by 206 % .
electorate upset and so upset are some residents that they want to see letchworth " de-parished " - that is the town council abolished , even though it was only established in 2005 .
a group of residents have now set up the organisation help - or help eliminate letchworth parish council - to rid themselves of what they see as an expensive and unnecessary extra layer of government .
matthew heaton , from help said : " everything is already covered by the district council and the county council .
" we 're paying for those services and they 're providing them perfectly well and we 're not keen to pay for another tier that will charge us again for the same services .
" we also see it as another layer of bureaucracy , and putting in another layer of bureaucracy is just unworkable . "
value for money the town council itself says it is good value for money and has many plans that will improve letchworth .
but it also needs funds - and time - to establish itself .
" we are a pennies , not a pounds council .
we are where democracy begins , not ends .
if you believe in community you have to take a leap of faith and handover money and power to our neighbourhoods " , says mayor philip ross .
many parish and town councils also argue that they are being forced to push up precepts to meet the extra obligations that are being placed on them by other councils further up the food chain - councils constrained in their spending by capping levels set by central government .
national examples in northumberland , several parish councils are considering taking over the running of their local libraries , currently owned and staffed by the county council .
in kirkham , in lancashire , the parish council there is looking at ways it can save the local swimming pool , which the district council says it may no longer be able to afford to keep open .
one option being considered is using parish council funds to help set up a community trust that would eventually run the pool .
bishop 's stortford town council , in hertfordshire , has already taken on services once provided at district level .
it runs one lot of public toilets in the town , and while the district council does provide some funding , the town council puts in money from the precept rather than risk them having to be closed due to a lack of cash .
funding should match function justin griggs , from the national association of local councils , admits that in some instances precepts have risen sharply , but points out that parish and town councils are doing much more , and need the funding to match their growing responsibilities .
" we 've seen 191 new parish councils created in the last 10 years in response to community demand .
" these are local people that are seeing gaps in service provision , seeing gaps in the representation and voice that 's provided to them , and they want an institution of local government that 's close to them to provide services , to respond to community needs and be their voice " , he said .

a statement on the military 's website said jets hit a kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- target " effectively " , in the zap region , on saturday night .
a pkk spokesman said the strike hit empty bases , causing no casualties .
turkey has launched a number of attacks against alleged pkk bases in recent months , several of them across the border in iraq .
" the fighters do not have fixed bases .
that is why such air strikes are useless because they do not have any effect on us , " pkk spokesman ahmad danas told the associated press news agency .
the pkk , which is seeking autonomy for kurds in south-eastern turkey , is designated as a terrorist organisation by turkey , the us and eu .
more than 30,000 people have been killed since the group began its armed campaign in 1984 .
turkey has accused iraq of failing to stop the rebels using its territory as a safe haven .
