about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "
soft landing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian farmers said they 'd rather give their milk for free than at bargain prices since the eu has decided to scrap all milk quotas in 2015 , it proposes raising the quotas every year until 2014 in an effort to provide a " soft landing " for milk farmers .
as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .
the protest organizers - the latvian dairy farmers union - warned that more protests may follow .
in the 1990s , latvians stood in long lines outside grocery stores for a loaf of bread as the small baltic nation struggled for its independence from the soviet union . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in moscow , however , the city authorities denied a pro-gay group a permit to march on saturday for the third year in a row .
in the past , gay pride has prompted savage backlashes in the three countries , with marches banned by the authorities and attacked by religious extremists , ultra-nationalists and communists .
in 2005 and 2006 , pro-gay activists in riga were attacked by anti-gay demonstrators who pelted them with eggs , fruit and excrement .
in 2007 , several hundred police , including heavily-armored riot squads , formed a human barrier at the vermanes park in central riga as up to 500 gay activists staged a peaceful " march for equality " inside .
in moscow , organizers have appealed to russian president dmitry medvedev to override the city administration 's ban on the parade .
up to 100 volunteers from amnesty international 's british and scandinavian groups are set to attend events in latvia on saturday , amnesty researcher anders dahlbeck said .
concern over latvian failures latvia 's failure to protect sexual minorities " has been very concerning , and we believe our presence at the march will ensure that the latvian authorities feel obliged to protect the march , including both latvian and international participants , " he told dpa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay rights supporters bring " love " to moscow 's streets members of the danish parliament also plan to act as observers .
" i hope our being there will give the right signal to the troublemakers , " the danish social democrat flemmin moeller mortensen told a danish radio station this week .
the troublemakers are mostly church leaders and politicians that frequently accuse gay activists of being pedophiles , perverts , criminals , drug addicts and mentally ill .
" i do n't think we should allow a small percentage of society to spread their perversion " , " the latvian capital 's deputy mayor andris argalis told leta news agency on wednesday .
" otherwise , we will have to give equal rights to other groups of people with sexual deviances . "
riga 's roman catholic archbishop , janis pujats , issued a letter this week condemning the parade as " unlawful , " saying it is immoral .
the archbishop condemned homosexuality as going " against the natural order and therefore again the laws of god . "
poland 's tensions still lurking tensions in predominantly catholic poland appeared to have abated after the country 's right-wing government lost elections last year , but they did n't disappear .

warsaw 's gay pride march is planned for june 7 .
in the baltics , homosexuality was outlawed throughout the soviet occupation .
it was decriminalized only after independence in 1991 , but public attitudes have been slow to change .
amnesty international also weighed in on lithuania for failing to respect the rights of homosexuals .
lithuania criticized in amnesty report in its 2008 report on the state of human rights worldwide , amnesty said : " lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -lrb- lgbt -rrb- peoples ' human rights were not respected and several lgbt events were cancelled in a discriminatory manner .

it also noted that sexual minorities were refused the right to put social advertising on public transport buses based on imbrasas 's decision to give " priority to the traditional family " and his disapproval for the public display of homosexual ideas in the city .
romanian march goes ahead unhindered despite the seething undercurrent of intolerance still prevalent in eastern europe , public displays of solidarity continue against a backdrop of resentment and threats of violence .
around 200 gay activists marched through bucharest last weekend in a heavily policed pride parade that defied efforts by romanian religious and far-right groups to have the annual event banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers were injured in budapest 's pride march in 2007 romania 's fifth annual gay festival went ahead despite an attempt by anti-gay groups to get a court to rule against the march .
before the pride march took place , two counter-demonstrations were held , including one by a far-right group whose members chanted " romania does not want you " in a protest they said was " against sin . "
romania decriminalized homosexuality in 2001 , but gay people often face hostility in this largely conservative country of 22 million where the powerful orthodox church views homosexuality as a sin and a disease .
there were no reports of violence in contrast to the event in 2007 , when around 1,200 riot police faced an angry mob and detained dozens of protesters who tried to break up the march . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , right , with gesine schwan , the spd 's candidate for german president " there is no question of forming a government with -lrb- the left -rrb- , nor any acceptance of support from it , because this party is totally at odds with our basic convictions , " beck said .
flirting with the left the spd , a member of angela merkel 's ruling left-right coalition , is grappling with a huge popularity slump amid internal bickering over economic policy and the party 's future course .
on friday , an opinion poll showed only 21 percent of germans would vote for the party in next year 's general election , the lowest score since taking office with chancellor angela merkel 's christian union in november 2005 .
merkel 's conservatives were at 42 percent .
leading spd officials have flirted with the left party , which has seats in 10 of germany 's state parliaments and is seen as a growing force on the political scene , turning off many mainstream voters , angering centrist social democrats and risking its credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the left party who have shaken up the political scene beck himself sparked a massive row in february when he sanctioned state-level cooperation with the left , which opposes economic reform and german troop deployments abroad and is in favor of renationalization .
on saturday , in an attempt to draw a line under the disputes , beck vowed the spd would not entertain any notion of cooperating with the left .
" after 2009 , there can not be any formation of a government with or toleration of this grouping -lrb- the left -rrb- , " beck said , adding there were huge policy differences from foreign affairs to economics .
on saturday , beck railed against the left 's planned " spending orgy " in social policies , saying the party promised voters everything .
the spd wants to lower the social security contributions of low-earners and make up for the budgetary shortfall by raising taxes for the wealthy .
looking for a " new direction " on saturday , beck indicated his preference for the free democrats , a traditional coalition partner of the spd , who are also being courted by merkel 's party .
" we are not closing any doors , we are deliberately opening them , " beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant of the spd party congress turned up in a show-stopping hairstyle media reports say the spd has also agreed that it will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and not beck who will be the spd candidate for chancellor against merkel in the september 2009 elections .
this week , the spd put forward its own candidate for german president , a move that has worsened relations with merkel 's conservatives who want a second term for horst koehler .
" it is clear to us all that we must not have a repetition of the last weeks and months , " spd general-secretary hubertus heil told n-24 television .

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "

as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .
the protest organizers - the latvian dairy farmers union - warned that more protests may follow .

in moscow , however , the city authorities denied a pro-gay group a permit to march on saturday for the third year in a row .
in the past , gay pride has prompted savage backlashes in the three countries , with marches banned by the authorities and attacked by religious extremists , ultra-nationalists and communists .
in 2005 and 2006 , pro-gay activists in riga were attacked by anti-gay demonstrators who pelted them with eggs , fruit and excrement .
in 2007 , several hundred police , including heavily-armored riot squads , formed a human barrier at the vermanes park in central riga as up to 500 gay activists staged a peaceful " march for equality " inside .
in moscow , organizers have appealed to russian president dmitry medvedev to override the city administration 's ban on the parade .
up to 100 volunteers from amnesty international 's british and scandinavian groups are set to attend events in latvia on saturday , amnesty researcher anders dahlbeck said .

the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .

gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .

gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was satisfied with the outcome of the conference the un convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was " alive again and back on the international political agenda , " gabriel said . but environmental organizations greenpeace and the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- expressed scepticism .
the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .
greenpeace and the wwf cast doubt on whether the goal of significantly cutting species loss by 2010 could be reached .
but both organizations welcomed additional funding promised by germany , norway and finland .
a de facto moratorium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gene-manipulated trees were a particular concern for environmental activists gabriel said the conference had secured a " de facto moratorium " on marine fertilization , the controversial practice of seeding the seas with iron filings to promote algae blooms in the hope of absorbing carbon dioxide .
cbd officials warn research is lacking on the impact on marine ecosystems .
gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .
poorer countries with unique natural resources are concerned at the patenting of indigenous remedies by the pharmaceutical industry without payments to the countries where they originate .
greenpeace and the wwf also saw the abs deal as significant progress .
life web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community still has a lot to do to protect endangered species cbd officials applauded significant progress on protected areas , including the initiative put forward by host country germany to set up an internet-based " life web " to link countries offering protected areas with countries prepared to fund them .
" this has been a major step forward , " gabriel said .
more than 30 countries had proposed a total area over land and sea of 68 million hectares - equivalent to one-and-a-half times the area of germany , he said , singling out indonesia , mexico and democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
biofuel still controversial gabriel said that while there had been no substantive agreement on the controversial issue of biofuels , a work programme on the issue had been set up for the two years leading to the nagoya conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .
significant announcements the conference also saw significant announcements from participating countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalist activists made sure their protest was visible brazilian environment minister carlos minc announced four new protected areas , three of them in the amazon basin and stressed his commitment to zero net deforestation by 2020 .
and environment minister jose endundo bononge said drc planned a huge new conservation area of up to 15 billion hectares - or the size of greece .
at a final plenary session continuing into friday evening , conference delegates reached consensus agreement on dozens of changes to the final text , with gabriel finding it necessary to call on some delegations to show flexibility .
the conference is the ninth meeting of the 191 countries participating in the cbd , which was agreed at the 1992 rio earth summit and given added impetus at the johannesburg sustainable development summit a decade later . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .

as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , right , with gesine schwan , the spd 's candidate for german president " there is no question of forming a government with -lrb- the left -rrb- , nor any acceptance of support from it , because this party is totally at odds with our basic convictions , " beck said .
flirting with the left the spd , a member of angela merkel 's ruling left-right coalition , is grappling with a huge popularity slump amid internal bickering over economic policy and the party 's future course .
on friday , an opinion poll showed only 21 percent of germans would vote for the party in next year 's general election , the lowest score since taking office with chancellor angela merkel 's christian union in november 2005 .
merkel 's conservatives were at 42 percent .
leading spd officials have flirted with the left party , which has seats in 10 of germany 's state parliaments and is seen as a growing force on the political scene , turning off many mainstream voters , angering centrist social democrats and risking its credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the left party who have shaken up the political scene beck himself sparked a massive row in february when he sanctioned state-level cooperation with the left , which opposes economic reform and german troop deployments abroad and is in favor of renationalization .
on saturday , in an attempt to draw a line under the disputes , beck vowed the spd would not entertain any notion of cooperating with the left .
" after 2009 , there can not be any formation of a government with or toleration of this grouping -lrb- the left -rrb- , " beck said , adding there were huge policy differences from foreign affairs to economics .
on saturday , beck railed against the left 's planned " spending orgy " in social policies , saying the party promised voters everything .
the spd wants to lower the social security contributions of low-earners and make up for the budgetary shortfall by raising taxes for the wealthy .
looking for a " new direction " on saturday , beck indicated his preference for the free democrats , a traditional coalition partner of the spd , who are also being courted by merkel 's party .
" we are not closing any doors , we are deliberately opening them , " beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant of the spd party congress turned up in a show-stopping hairstyle media reports say the spd has also agreed that it will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and not beck who will be the spd candidate for chancellor against merkel in the september 2009 elections .
this week , the spd put forward its own candidate for german president , a move that has worsened relations with merkel 's conservatives who want a second term for horst koehler .
" it is clear to us all that we must not have a repetition of the last weeks and months , " spd general-secretary hubertus heil told n-24 television .
" now we are looking ahead , the new direction starts here in nuremberg . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : preserving biodiversity merkel pledges funds at un biodiversity talks merkel warns of extinction threat to life on earth progress at mid-way point for un biodiversity conference biodiversity loss can dent world economy , study warns environment -pipe- 31.05.2008 biodiversity conference ends with mixed results großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf activitsts were not impressed by the outcome of the un biodiversity conference the organizers of the un biodiversity conference that ended in bonn on friday evening claimed success in securing funding to protect wildlife , while activists voiced disappointment over what they saw as slow progress . german environment minister sigmar gabriel , the conference president , said " greater consensus than hoped for at the start " had been reached .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was satisfied with the outcome of the conference the un convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was " alive again and back on the international political agenda , " gabriel said . but environmental organizations greenpeace and the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- expressed scepticism .
the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .
greenpeace and the wwf cast doubt on whether the goal of significantly cutting species loss by 2010 could be reached .
but both organizations welcomed additional funding promised by germany , norway and finland .
a de facto moratorium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gene-manipulated trees were a particular concern for environmental activists gabriel said the conference had secured a " de facto moratorium " on marine fertilization , the controversial practice of seeding the seas with iron filings to promote algae blooms in the hope of absorbing carbon dioxide .
cbd officials warn research is lacking on the impact on marine ecosystems .
gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .
poorer countries with unique natural resources are concerned at the patenting of indigenous remedies by the pharmaceutical industry without payments to the countries where they originate .
greenpeace and the wwf also saw the abs deal as significant progress .
life web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community still has a lot to do to protect endangered species cbd officials applauded significant progress on protected areas , including the initiative put forward by host country germany to set up an internet-based " life web " to link countries offering protected areas with countries prepared to fund them .
" this has been a major step forward , " gabriel said .
more than 30 countries had proposed a total area over land and sea of 68 million hectares - equivalent to one-and-a-half times the area of germany , he said , singling out indonesia , mexico and democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
biofuel still controversial gabriel said that while there had been no substantive agreement on the controversial issue of biofuels , a work programme on the issue had been set up for the two years leading to the nagoya conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .
significant announcements the conference also saw significant announcements from participating countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalist activists made sure their protest was visible brazilian environment minister carlos minc announced four new protected areas , three of them in the amazon basin and stressed his commitment to zero net deforestation by 2020 .
and environment minister jose endundo bononge said drc planned a huge new conservation area of up to 15 billion hectares - or the size of greece .
at a final plenary session continuing into friday evening , conference delegates reached consensus agreement on dozens of changes to the final text , with gabriel finding it necessary to call on some delegations to show flexibility .
the conference is the ninth meeting of the 191 countries participating in the cbd , which was agreed at the 1992 rio earth summit and given added impetus at the johannesburg sustainable development summit a decade later . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government made intense efforts to secure the release of the german national and managed to reach agreement with the us , " a spokesman of the ministry said .
the man was detained at the beginning of january this year in a kabul supermarket on a us base after american officials apparently found him acting suspiciously .
the man , who lives in the city of wuppertal , was visiting relatives at the time .
wrong place at the wrong time the german ambassador to afghanistan , hans-ulrich seidt , who was allowed by us authorities to visit the man in prison months after his capture , had said the ghaus had seemed disoriented .
ghaus ' release on saturday , may 31 , came after months of diplomatic efforts by the german government to get him freed .
german security officials , who investigated ghaus ' family and friends , suspect he was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time and that he at no stage posed a security risk .
the case sparked comparisons with a german of turkish origin , murat kuraz , who was held in the us military 's guantanamo bay camp on cuba for more than four years without ever being charged .
kurnaz was just 19 at the time of his arrest in afghanistan . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 31.05.2008 pride season pits pro-gay groups against intolerance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay pride supporters in latvia and poland have been given the green light to march as cold european air gives way to a warmer front , the season of eastern european gay pride parades is at hand to remind authorities of tolerance toward sexual minorities . groups in latvia and poland received permission to stage gay pride parades in their respective capitals , arguing that it 's their right under european union law .
in moscow , however , the city authorities denied a pro-gay group a permit to march on saturday for the third year in a row .
in the past , gay pride has prompted savage backlashes in the three countries , with marches banned by the authorities and attacked by religious extremists , ultra-nationalists and communists .
in 2005 and 2006 , pro-gay activists in riga were attacked by anti-gay demonstrators who pelted them with eggs , fruit and excrement .
in 2007 , several hundred police , including heavily-armored riot squads , formed a human barrier at the vermanes park in central riga as up to 500 gay activists staged a peaceful " march for equality " inside .
in moscow , organizers have appealed to russian president dmitry medvedev to override the city administration 's ban on the parade .
up to 100 volunteers from amnesty international 's british and scandinavian groups are set to attend events in latvia on saturday , amnesty researcher anders dahlbeck said .
concern over latvian failures latvia 's failure to protect sexual minorities " has been very concerning , and we believe our presence at the march will ensure that the latvian authorities feel obliged to protect the march , including both latvian and international participants , " he told dpa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay rights supporters bring " love " to moscow 's streets members of the danish parliament also plan to act as observers .
" i hope our being there will give the right signal to the troublemakers , " the danish social democrat flemmin moeller mortensen told a danish radio station this week .
the troublemakers are mostly church leaders and politicians that frequently accuse gay activists of being pedophiles , perverts , criminals , drug addicts and mentally ill .
" i do n't think we should allow a small percentage of society to spread their perversion " , " the latvian capital 's deputy mayor andris argalis told leta news agency on wednesday .
" otherwise , we will have to give equal rights to other groups of people with sexual deviances . "
riga 's roman catholic archbishop , janis pujats , issued a letter this week condemning the parade as " unlawful , " saying it is immoral .
the archbishop condemned homosexuality as going " against the natural order and therefore again the laws of god . "
poland 's tensions still lurking tensions in predominantly catholic poland appeared to have abated after the country 's right-wing government lost elections last year , but they did n't disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent opposition to gays is still evident in some nations pro-gay groups and amnesty international say discrimination based on sexual orientation persists .
warsaw 's gay pride march is planned for june 7 .
in the baltics , homosexuality was outlawed throughout the soviet occupation .
it was decriminalized only after independence in 1991 , but public attitudes have been slow to change .
amnesty international also weighed in on lithuania for failing to respect the rights of homosexuals .
lithuania criticized in amnesty report in its 2008 report on the state of human rights worldwide , amnesty said : " lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -lrb- lgbt -rrb- peoples ' human rights were not respected and several lgbt events were cancelled in a discriminatory manner .
-lrb- the lithuanian -rrb- parliament also discussed banning information which would put homosexuality in a positive light to minors . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international 's barbara lochbihler with the report the report also highlighted the decision of vilnius mayor juozas imbrasas to ban an eu-sponsored anti-discrimination truck from coming to the lithuanian capital and to refuse permission for a tolerance campaign rally by homosexuals last may .
it also noted that sexual minorities were refused the right to put social advertising on public transport buses based on imbrasas 's decision to give " priority to the traditional family " and his disapproval for the public display of homosexual ideas in the city .
romanian march goes ahead unhindered despite the seething undercurrent of intolerance still prevalent in eastern europe , public displays of solidarity continue against a backdrop of resentment and threats of violence .
around 200 gay activists marched through bucharest last weekend in a heavily policed pride parade that defied efforts by romanian religious and far-right groups to have the annual event banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers were injured in budapest 's pride march in 2007 romania 's fifth annual gay festival went ahead despite an attempt by anti-gay groups to get a court to rule against the march .
before the pride march took place , two counter-demonstrations were held , including one by a far-right group whose members chanted " romania does not want you " in a protest they said was " against sin . "
romania decriminalized homosexuality in 2001 , but gay people often face hostility in this largely conservative country of 22 million where the powerful orthodox church views homosexuality as a sin and a disease .
there were no reports of violence in contrast to the event in 2007 , when around 1,200 riot police faced an angry mob and detained dozens of protesters who tried to break up the march . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poorer countries with unique natural resources are concerned at the patenting of indigenous remedies by the pharmaceutical industry without payments to the countries where they originate .
greenpeace and the wwf also saw the abs deal as significant progress .
life web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community still has a lot to do to protect endangered species cbd officials applauded significant progress on protected areas , including the initiative put forward by host country germany to set up an internet-based " life web " to link countries offering protected areas with countries prepared to fund them .
" this has been a major step forward , " gabriel said .
more than 30 countries had proposed a total area over land and sea of 68 million hectares - equivalent to one-and-a-half times the area of germany , he said , singling out indonesia , mexico and democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
biofuel still controversial gabriel said that while there had been no substantive agreement on the controversial issue of biofuels , a work programme on the issue had been set up for the two years leading to the nagoya conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .
significant announcements the conference also saw significant announcements from participating countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalist activists made sure their protest was visible brazilian environment minister carlos minc announced four new protected areas , three of them in the amazon basin and stressed his commitment to zero net deforestation by 2020 .
and environment minister jose endundo bononge said drc planned a huge new conservation area of up to 15 billion hectares - or the size of greece .
at a final plenary session continuing into friday evening , conference delegates reached consensus agreement on dozens of changes to the final text , with gabriel finding it necessary to call on some delegations to show flexibility .
the conference is the ninth meeting of the 191 countries participating in the cbd , which was agreed at the 1992 rio earth summit and given added impetus at the johannesburg sustainable development summit a decade later . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government made intense efforts to secure the release of the german national and managed to reach agreement with the us , " a spokesman of the ministry said .
the man was detained at the beginning of january this year in a kabul supermarket on a us base after american officials apparently found him acting suspiciously .
the man , who lives in the city of wuppertal , was visiting relatives at the time .
wrong place at the wrong time the german ambassador to afghanistan , hans-ulrich seidt , who was allowed by us authorities to visit the man in prison months after his capture , had said the ghaus had seemed disoriented .
ghaus ' release on saturday , may 31 , came after months of diplomatic efforts by the german government to get him freed .
german security officials , who investigated ghaus ' family and friends , suspect he was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time and that he at no stage posed a security risk .
the case sparked comparisons with a german of turkish origin , murat kuraz , who was held in the us military 's guantanamo bay camp on cuba for more than four years without ever being charged .

in moscow , however , the city authorities denied a pro-gay group a permit to march on saturday for the third year in a row .
in the past , gay pride has prompted savage backlashes in the three countries , with marches banned by the authorities and attacked by religious extremists , ultra-nationalists and communists .
in 2005 and 2006 , pro-gay activists in riga were attacked by anti-gay demonstrators who pelted them with eggs , fruit and excrement .
in 2007 , several hundred police , including heavily-armored riot squads , formed a human barrier at the vermanes park in central riga as up to 500 gay activists staged a peaceful " march for equality " inside .
in moscow , organizers have appealed to russian president dmitry medvedev to override the city administration 's ban on the parade .
up to 100 volunteers from amnesty international 's british and scandinavian groups are set to attend events in latvia on saturday , amnesty researcher anders dahlbeck said .
concern over latvian failures latvia 's failure to protect sexual minorities " has been very concerning , and we believe our presence at the march will ensure that the latvian authorities feel obliged to protect the march , including both latvian and international participants , " he told dpa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay rights supporters bring " love " to moscow 's streets members of the danish parliament also plan to act as observers .
" i hope our being there will give the right signal to the troublemakers , " the danish social democrat flemmin moeller mortensen told a danish radio station this week .
the troublemakers are mostly church leaders and politicians that frequently accuse gay activists of being pedophiles , perverts , criminals , drug addicts and mentally ill .
" i do n't think we should allow a small percentage of society to spread their perversion " , " the latvian capital 's deputy mayor andris argalis told leta news agency on wednesday .
" otherwise , we will have to give equal rights to other groups of people with sexual deviances . "
riga 's roman catholic archbishop , janis pujats , issued a letter this week condemning the parade as " unlawful , " saying it is immoral .
the archbishop condemned homosexuality as going " against the natural order and therefore again the laws of god . "
poland 's tensions still lurking tensions in predominantly catholic poland appeared to have abated after the country 's right-wing government lost elections last year , but they did n't disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent opposition to gays is still evident in some nations pro-gay groups and amnesty international say discrimination based on sexual orientation persists .
warsaw 's gay pride march is planned for june 7 .
in the baltics , homosexuality was outlawed throughout the soviet occupation .
it was decriminalized only after independence in 1991 , but public attitudes have been slow to change .
amnesty international also weighed in on lithuania for failing to respect the rights of homosexuals .
lithuania criticized in amnesty report in its 2008 report on the state of human rights worldwide , amnesty said : " lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -lrb- lgbt -rrb- peoples ' human rights were not respected and several lgbt events were cancelled in a discriminatory manner .
-lrb- the lithuanian -rrb- parliament also discussed banning information which would put homosexuality in a positive light to minors . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international 's barbara lochbihler with the report the report also highlighted the decision of vilnius mayor juozas imbrasas to ban an eu-sponsored anti-discrimination truck from coming to the lithuanian capital and to refuse permission for a tolerance campaign rally by homosexuals last may .
it also noted that sexual minorities were refused the right to put social advertising on public transport buses based on imbrasas 's decision to give " priority to the traditional family " and his disapproval for the public display of homosexual ideas in the city .
romanian march goes ahead unhindered despite the seething undercurrent of intolerance still prevalent in eastern europe , public displays of solidarity continue against a backdrop of resentment and threats of violence .
around 200 gay activists marched through bucharest last weekend in a heavily policed pride parade that defied efforts by romanian religious and far-right groups to have the annual event banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers were injured in budapest 's pride march in 2007 romania 's fifth annual gay festival went ahead despite an attempt by anti-gay groups to get a court to rule against the march .
before the pride march took place , two counter-demonstrations were held , including one by a far-right group whose members chanted " romania does not want you " in a protest they said was " against sin . "
romania decriminalized homosexuality in 2001 , but gay people often face hostility in this largely conservative country of 22 million where the powerful orthodox church views homosexuality as a sin and a disease .
there were no reports of violence in contrast to the event in 2007 , when around 1,200 riot police faced an angry mob and detained dozens of protesters who tried to break up the march . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , right , with gesine schwan , the spd 's candidate for german president " there is no question of forming a government with -lrb- the left -rrb- , nor any acceptance of support from it , because this party is totally at odds with our basic convictions , " beck said .
flirting with the left the spd , a member of angela merkel 's ruling left-right coalition , is grappling with a huge popularity slump amid internal bickering over economic policy and the party 's future course .
on friday , an opinion poll showed only 21 percent of germans would vote for the party in next year 's general election , the lowest score since taking office with chancellor angela merkel 's christian union in november 2005 .
merkel 's conservatives were at 42 percent .
leading spd officials have flirted with the left party , which has seats in 10 of germany 's state parliaments and is seen as a growing force on the political scene , turning off many mainstream voters , angering centrist social democrats and risking its credibility .

on saturday , in an attempt to draw a line under the disputes , beck vowed the spd would not entertain any notion of cooperating with the left .
" after 2009 , there can not be any formation of a government with or toleration of this grouping -lrb- the left -rrb- , " beck said , adding there were huge policy differences from foreign affairs to economics .
on saturday , beck railed against the left 's planned " spending orgy " in social policies , saying the party promised voters everything .
the spd wants to lower the social security contributions of low-earners and make up for the budgetary shortfall by raising taxes for the wealthy .
looking for a " new direction " on saturday , beck indicated his preference for the free democrats , a traditional coalition partner of the spd , who are also being courted by merkel 's party .
" we are not closing any doors , we are deliberately opening them , " beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant of the spd party congress turned up in a show-stopping hairstyle media reports say the spd has also agreed that it will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and not beck who will be the spd candidate for chancellor against merkel in the september 2009 elections .
this week , the spd put forward its own candidate for german president , a move that has worsened relations with merkel 's conservatives who want a second term for horst koehler .

" ballack electrifies everyone ... he can lead us to the title , " the bild am sonntag sunday paper said in praise of the chelsea midfielder . serbia takes lead serbia , who failed to qualify for euro 2008 , proved an awkward opponent in gelsenkirchen for germany eight days before joachim loew 's side kick off their euro 2008 campaign against poland .
the home crowd were silenced in the 19th minute when an exchange of passes in midfield allowed sasa ilic to split the back four with a pass to bosko jankovic who raced clear to slide the ball between the legs of jens lehmann in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuville scores in the 74th minute , bringing much-needed relief to the german side it was the first chance of the game for serbia , with ilic 's pass exposing exactly the area of defense which had been a concern in tuesday 's 2-2 draw with belarus .
neuville breaks deadlock loew made four changes from the team which drew 2-2 with belarus on tuesday , bringing in marcell jansen at left-back , clemens fritz on the right of midfield and kevin kuranyi and mario gomez in attack .
christoph metzelder , who had played only nine games for real madrid this season because of a foot injury , was given another chance to prove his fitness .
germany began strongly and serbia central defender nemanja vidic had to clear off the line from a ballack header in the 14th minute .
gomez was unfortunate not to equalize 10 minutes before the break when he failed to connect properly in front of goal from a jansen cross .
germany also had a strong penalty appeal turned down after torsten frings appeared to be tripped in the box by ilic .
podolski came on at half-time for philipp lahm , moving to the left of midfield as germany pressed for an equalizer , but it was serbia who came closest when jankovic crashed the ball against the bar from close range in the 54th minute .
arne friedrich replaced per mertesacker in central defence at half-time , and further substitutions followed , with simon rolfes coming on for torsten frings , neuville replacing kuranyi in the 70th minute , and bastian schweinsteiger later making way for odonkor .
it was neuville who finally broke the deadlock when he came off the bench in the 70th minute to score from close range four minutes later . ballack in top form after jansen was fouled on the edge of the area by branislav ivanovic , who earned a yellow card , the free-kick was touched to rolfes who teed up ballack to strike a right-foot shot into the corner of the net .
germany coach joachim loew heaped praise on his key player . " michael ballack permanently led the team on the attack .
he is in great shape .
he scored a deciding goal .

in moscow , however , the city authorities denied a pro-gay group a permit to march on saturday for the third year in a row .
in the past , gay pride has prompted savage backlashes in the three countries , with marches banned by the authorities and attacked by religious extremists , ultra-nationalists and communists .
in 2005 and 2006 , pro-gay activists in riga were attacked by anti-gay demonstrators who pelted them with eggs , fruit and excrement .
in 2007 , several hundred police , including heavily-armored riot squads , formed a human barrier at the vermanes park in central riga as up to 500 gay activists staged a peaceful " march for equality " inside .
in moscow , organizers have appealed to russian president dmitry medvedev to override the city administration 's ban on the parade .
up to 100 volunteers from amnesty international 's british and scandinavian groups are set to attend events in latvia on saturday , amnesty researcher anders dahlbeck said .
concern over latvian failures latvia 's failure to protect sexual minorities " has been very concerning , and we believe our presence at the march will ensure that the latvian authorities feel obliged to protect the march , including both latvian and international participants , " he told dpa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay rights supporters bring " love " to moscow 's streets members of the danish parliament also plan to act as observers .
" i hope our being there will give the right signal to the troublemakers , " the danish social democrat flemmin moeller mortensen told a danish radio station this week .
the troublemakers are mostly church leaders and politicians that frequently accuse gay activists of being pedophiles , perverts , criminals , drug addicts and mentally ill .
" i do n't think we should allow a small percentage of society to spread their perversion " , " the latvian capital 's deputy mayor andris argalis told leta news agency on wednesday .
" otherwise , we will have to give equal rights to other groups of people with sexual deviances . "
riga 's roman catholic archbishop , janis pujats , issued a letter this week condemning the parade as " unlawful , " saying it is immoral .
the archbishop condemned homosexuality as going " against the natural order and therefore again the laws of god . "
poland 's tensions still lurking tensions in predominantly catholic poland appeared to have abated after the country 's right-wing government lost elections last year , but they did n't disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent opposition to gays is still evident in some nations pro-gay groups and amnesty international say discrimination based on sexual orientation persists .
warsaw 's gay pride march is planned for june 7 .
in the baltics , homosexuality was outlawed throughout the soviet occupation .
it was decriminalized only after independence in 1991 , but public attitudes have been slow to change .
amnesty international also weighed in on lithuania for failing to respect the rights of homosexuals .
lithuania criticized in amnesty report in its 2008 report on the state of human rights worldwide , amnesty said : " lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -lrb- lgbt -rrb- peoples ' human rights were not respected and several lgbt events were cancelled in a discriminatory manner .
-lrb- the lithuanian -rrb- parliament also discussed banning information which would put homosexuality in a positive light to minors . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international 's barbara lochbihler with the report the report also highlighted the decision of vilnius mayor juozas imbrasas to ban an eu-sponsored anti-discrimination truck from coming to the lithuanian capital and to refuse permission for a tolerance campaign rally by homosexuals last may .
it also noted that sexual minorities were refused the right to put social advertising on public transport buses based on imbrasas 's decision to give " priority to the traditional family " and his disapproval for the public display of homosexual ideas in the city .
romanian march goes ahead unhindered despite the seething undercurrent of intolerance still prevalent in eastern europe , public displays of solidarity continue against a backdrop of resentment and threats of violence .
around 200 gay activists marched through bucharest last weekend in a heavily policed pride parade that defied efforts by romanian religious and far-right groups to have the annual event banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers were injured in budapest 's pride march in 2007 romania 's fifth annual gay festival went ahead despite an attempt by anti-gay groups to get a court to rule against the march .
before the pride march took place , two counter-demonstrations were held , including one by a far-right group whose members chanted " romania does not want you " in a protest they said was " against sin . "
romania decriminalized homosexuality in 2001 , but gay people often face hostility in this largely conservative country of 22 million where the powerful orthodox church views homosexuality as a sin and a disease .
there were no reports of violence in contrast to the event in 2007 , when around 1,200 riot police faced an angry mob and detained dozens of protesters who tried to break up the march . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de poland : homophobia spreads with government backing poland has recently shocked the eu by introducing regulations to stop what it called the “ promotion of homosexuality in schools ” .

" ballack electrifies everyone ... he can lead us to the title , " the bild am sonntag sunday paper said in praise of the chelsea midfielder . serbia takes lead serbia , who failed to qualify for euro 2008 , proved an awkward opponent in gelsenkirchen for germany eight days before joachim loew 's side kick off their euro 2008 campaign against poland .
the home crowd were silenced in the 19th minute when an exchange of passes in midfield allowed sasa ilic to split the back four with a pass to bosko jankovic who raced clear to slide the ball between the legs of jens lehmann in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuville scores in the 74th minute , bringing much-needed relief to the german side it was the first chance of the game for serbia , with ilic 's pass exposing exactly the area of defense which had been a concern in tuesday 's 2-2 draw with belarus .
neuville breaks deadlock loew made four changes from the team which drew 2-2 with belarus on tuesday , bringing in marcell jansen at left-back , clemens fritz on the right of midfield and kevin kuranyi and mario gomez in attack .
christoph metzelder , who had played only nine games for real madrid this season because of a foot injury , was given another chance to prove his fitness .
germany began strongly and serbia central defender nemanja vidic had to clear off the line from a ballack header in the 14th minute .
gomez was unfortunate not to equalize 10 minutes before the break when he failed to connect properly in front of goal from a jansen cross .
germany also had a strong penalty appeal turned down after torsten frings appeared to be tripped in the box by ilic .
podolski came on at half-time for philipp lahm , moving to the left of midfield as germany pressed for an equalizer , but it was serbia who came closest when jankovic crashed the ball against the bar from close range in the 54th minute .
arne friedrich replaced per mertesacker in central defence at half-time , and further substitutions followed , with simon rolfes coming on for torsten frings , neuville replacing kuranyi in the 70th minute , and bastian schweinsteiger later making way for odonkor .

" ballack electrifies everyone ... he can lead us to the title , " the bild am sonntag sunday paper said in praise of the chelsea midfielder . serbia takes lead serbia , who failed to qualify for euro 2008 , proved an awkward opponent in gelsenkirchen for germany eight days before joachim loew 's side kick off their euro 2008 campaign against poland .
the home crowd were silenced in the 19th minute when an exchange of passes in midfield allowed sasa ilic to split the back four with a pass to bosko jankovic who raced clear to slide the ball between the legs of jens lehmann in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuville scores in the 74th minute , bringing much-needed relief to the german side it was the first chance of the game for serbia , with ilic 's pass exposing exactly the area of defense which had been a concern in tuesday 's 2-2 draw with belarus .
neuville breaks deadlock loew made four changes from the team which drew 2-2 with belarus on tuesday , bringing in marcell jansen at left-back , clemens fritz on the right of midfield and kevin kuranyi and mario gomez in attack .
christoph metzelder , who had played only nine games for real madrid this season because of a foot injury , was given another chance to prove his fitness .
germany began strongly and serbia central defender nemanja vidic had to clear off the line from a ballack header in the 14th minute .
gomez was unfortunate not to equalize 10 minutes before the break when he failed to connect properly in front of goal from a jansen cross .
germany also had a strong penalty appeal turned down after torsten frings appeared to be tripped in the box by ilic .
podolski came on at half-time for philipp lahm , moving to the left of midfield as germany pressed for an equalizer , but it was serbia who came closest when jankovic crashed the ball against the bar from close range in the 54th minute .
arne friedrich replaced per mertesacker in central defence at half-time , and further substitutions followed , with simon rolfes coming on for torsten frings , neuville replacing kuranyi in the 70th minute , and bastian schweinsteiger later making way for odonkor .
it was neuville who finally broke the deadlock when he came off the bench in the 70th minute to score from close range four minutes later . ballack in top form after jansen was fouled on the edge of the area by branislav ivanovic , who earned a yellow card , the free-kick was touched to rolfes who teed up ballack to strike a right-foot shot into the corner of the net .
germany coach joachim loew heaped praise on his key player . " michael ballack permanently led the team on the attack .
he is in great shape .
he scored a deciding goal .
he had a strong presence on the field , " said loew . ballack , who is still in search of his firsdt major trophy , could make the difference for the three-time champion germany at the june 7-29 tournament in austria and switzerland . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "
soft landing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian farmers said they 'd rather give their milk for free than at bargain prices since the eu has decided to scrap all milk quotas in 2015 , it proposes raising the quotas every year until 2014 in an effort to provide a " soft landing " for milk farmers .
as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .
the protest organizers - the latvian dairy farmers union - warned that more protests may follow .
in the 1990s , latvians stood in long lines outside grocery stores for a loaf of bread as the small baltic nation struggled for its independence from the soviet union . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .

the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .
significant announcements the conference also saw significant announcements from participating countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalist activists made sure their protest was visible brazilian environment minister carlos minc announced four new protected areas , three of them in the amazon basin and stressed his commitment to zero net deforestation by 2020 .
and environment minister jose endundo bononge said drc planned a huge new conservation area of up to 15 billion hectares - or the size of greece .
at a final plenary session continuing into friday evening , conference delegates reached consensus agreement on dozens of changes to the final text , with gabriel finding it necessary to call on some delegations to show flexibility .
the conference is the ninth meeting of the 191 countries participating in the cbd , which was agreed at the 1992 rio earth summit and given added impetus at the johannesburg sustainable development summit a decade later . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was satisfied with the outcome of the conference the un convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was " alive again and back on the international political agenda , " gabriel said . but environmental organizations greenpeace and the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- expressed scepticism .
the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .
greenpeace and the wwf cast doubt on whether the goal of significantly cutting species loss by 2010 could be reached .
but both organizations welcomed additional funding promised by germany , norway and finland .
a de facto moratorium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gene-manipulated trees were a particular concern for environmental activists gabriel said the conference had secured a " de facto moratorium " on marine fertilization , the controversial practice of seeding the seas with iron filings to promote algae blooms in the hope of absorbing carbon dioxide .
cbd officials warn research is lacking on the impact on marine ecosystems .
gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .
poorer countries with unique natural resources are concerned at the patenting of indigenous remedies by the pharmaceutical industry without payments to the countries where they originate .
greenpeace and the wwf also saw the abs deal as significant progress .
life web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community still has a lot to do to protect endangered species cbd officials applauded significant progress on protected areas , including the initiative put forward by host country germany to set up an internet-based " life web " to link countries offering protected areas with countries prepared to fund them .
" this has been a major step forward , " gabriel said .
more than 30 countries had proposed a total area over land and sea of 68 million hectares - equivalent to one-and-a-half times the area of germany , he said , singling out indonesia , mexico and democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
biofuel still controversial gabriel said that while there had been no substantive agreement on the controversial issue of biofuels , a work programme on the issue had been set up for the two years leading to the nagoya conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .
significant announcements the conference also saw significant announcements from participating countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalist activists made sure their protest was visible brazilian environment minister carlos minc announced four new protected areas , three of them in the amazon basin and stressed his commitment to zero net deforestation by 2020 .
and environment minister jose endundo bononge said drc planned a huge new conservation area of up to 15 billion hectares - or the size of greece .
at a final plenary session continuing into friday evening , conference delegates reached consensus agreement on dozens of changes to the final text , with gabriel finding it necessary to call on some delegations to show flexibility .
the conference is the ninth meeting of the 191 countries participating in the cbd , which was agreed at the 1992 rio earth summit and given added impetus at the johannesburg sustainable development summit a decade later . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "

as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , right , with gesine schwan , the spd 's candidate for german president " there is no question of forming a government with -lrb- the left -rrb- , nor any acceptance of support from it , because this party is totally at odds with our basic convictions , " beck said .
flirting with the left the spd , a member of angela merkel 's ruling left-right coalition , is grappling with a huge popularity slump amid internal bickering over economic policy and the party 's future course .
on friday , an opinion poll showed only 21 percent of germans would vote for the party in next year 's general election , the lowest score since taking office with chancellor angela merkel 's christian union in november 2005 .
merkel 's conservatives were at 42 percent .
leading spd officials have flirted with the left party , which has seats in 10 of germany 's state parliaments and is seen as a growing force on the political scene , turning off many mainstream voters , angering centrist social democrats and risking its credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the left party who have shaken up the political scene beck himself sparked a massive row in february when he sanctioned state-level cooperation with the left , which opposes economic reform and german troop deployments abroad and is in favor of renationalization .
on saturday , in an attempt to draw a line under the disputes , beck vowed the spd would not entertain any notion of cooperating with the left .
" after 2009 , there can not be any formation of a government with or toleration of this grouping -lrb- the left -rrb- , " beck said , adding there were huge policy differences from foreign affairs to economics .
on saturday , beck railed against the left 's planned " spending orgy " in social policies , saying the party promised voters everything .
the spd wants to lower the social security contributions of low-earners and make up for the budgetary shortfall by raising taxes for the wealthy .
looking for a " new direction " on saturday , beck indicated his preference for the free democrats , a traditional coalition partner of the spd , who are also being courted by merkel 's party .
" we are not closing any doors , we are deliberately opening them , " beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant of the spd party congress turned up in a show-stopping hairstyle media reports say the spd has also agreed that it will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and not beck who will be the spd candidate for chancellor against merkel in the september 2009 elections .
this week , the spd put forward its own candidate for german president , a move that has worsened relations with merkel 's conservatives who want a second term for horst koehler .
" it is clear to us all that we must not have a repetition of the last weeks and months , " spd general-secretary hubertus heil told n-24 television .

in moscow , however , the city authorities denied a pro-gay group a permit to march on saturday for the third year in a row .
in the past , gay pride has prompted savage backlashes in the three countries , with marches banned by the authorities and attacked by religious extremists , ultra-nationalists and communists .
in 2005 and 2006 , pro-gay activists in riga were attacked by anti-gay demonstrators who pelted them with eggs , fruit and excrement .
in 2007 , several hundred police , including heavily-armored riot squads , formed a human barrier at the vermanes park in central riga as up to 500 gay activists staged a peaceful " march for equality " inside .
in moscow , organizers have appealed to russian president dmitry medvedev to override the city administration 's ban on the parade .
up to 100 volunteers from amnesty international 's british and scandinavian groups are set to attend events in latvia on saturday , amnesty researcher anders dahlbeck said .
concern over latvian failures latvia 's failure to protect sexual minorities " has been very concerning , and we believe our presence at the march will ensure that the latvian authorities feel obliged to protect the march , including both latvian and international participants , " he told dpa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay rights supporters bring " love " to moscow 's streets members of the danish parliament also plan to act as observers .
" i hope our being there will give the right signal to the troublemakers , " the danish social democrat flemmin moeller mortensen told a danish radio station this week .
the troublemakers are mostly church leaders and politicians that frequently accuse gay activists of being pedophiles , perverts , criminals , drug addicts and mentally ill .
" i do n't think we should allow a small percentage of society to spread their perversion " , " the latvian capital 's deputy mayor andris argalis told leta news agency on wednesday .
" otherwise , we will have to give equal rights to other groups of people with sexual deviances . "
riga 's roman catholic archbishop , janis pujats , issued a letter this week condemning the parade as " unlawful , " saying it is immoral .
the archbishop condemned homosexuality as going " against the natural order and therefore again the laws of god . "
poland 's tensions still lurking tensions in predominantly catholic poland appeared to have abated after the country 's right-wing government lost elections last year , but they did n't disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent opposition to gays is still evident in some nations pro-gay groups and amnesty international say discrimination based on sexual orientation persists .
warsaw 's gay pride march is planned for june 7 .
in the baltics , homosexuality was outlawed throughout the soviet occupation .
it was decriminalized only after independence in 1991 , but public attitudes have been slow to change .
amnesty international also weighed in on lithuania for failing to respect the rights of homosexuals .
lithuania criticized in amnesty report in its 2008 report on the state of human rights worldwide , amnesty said : " lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -lrb- lgbt -rrb- peoples ' human rights were not respected and several lgbt events were cancelled in a discriminatory manner .
-lrb- the lithuanian -rrb- parliament also discussed banning information which would put homosexuality in a positive light to minors . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international 's barbara lochbihler with the report the report also highlighted the decision of vilnius mayor juozas imbrasas to ban an eu-sponsored anti-discrimination truck from coming to the lithuanian capital and to refuse permission for a tolerance campaign rally by homosexuals last may .
it also noted that sexual minorities were refused the right to put social advertising on public transport buses based on imbrasas 's decision to give " priority to the traditional family " and his disapproval for the public display of homosexual ideas in the city .
romanian march goes ahead unhindered despite the seething undercurrent of intolerance still prevalent in eastern europe , public displays of solidarity continue against a backdrop of resentment and threats of violence .
around 200 gay activists marched through bucharest last weekend in a heavily policed pride parade that defied efforts by romanian religious and far-right groups to have the annual event banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers were injured in budapest 's pride march in 2007 romania 's fifth annual gay festival went ahead despite an attempt by anti-gay groups to get a court to rule against the march .

in moscow , however , the city authorities denied a pro-gay group a permit to march on saturday for the third year in a row .
in the past , gay pride has prompted savage backlashes in the three countries , with marches banned by the authorities and attacked by religious extremists , ultra-nationalists and communists .
in 2005 and 2006 , pro-gay activists in riga were attacked by anti-gay demonstrators who pelted them with eggs , fruit and excrement .
in 2007 , several hundred police , including heavily-armored riot squads , formed a human barrier at the vermanes park in central riga as up to 500 gay activists staged a peaceful " march for equality " inside .
in moscow , organizers have appealed to russian president dmitry medvedev to override the city administration 's ban on the parade .
up to 100 volunteers from amnesty international 's british and scandinavian groups are set to attend events in latvia on saturday , amnesty researcher anders dahlbeck said .
concern over latvian failures latvia 's failure to protect sexual minorities " has been very concerning , and we believe our presence at the march will ensure that the latvian authorities feel obliged to protect the march , including both latvian and international participants , " he told dpa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay rights supporters bring " love " to moscow 's streets members of the danish parliament also plan to act as observers .
" i hope our being there will give the right signal to the troublemakers , " the danish social democrat flemmin moeller mortensen told a danish radio station this week .
the troublemakers are mostly church leaders and politicians that frequently accuse gay activists of being pedophiles , perverts , criminals , drug addicts and mentally ill .
" i do n't think we should allow a small percentage of society to spread their perversion " , " the latvian capital 's deputy mayor andris argalis told leta news agency on wednesday .
" otherwise , we will have to give equal rights to other groups of people with sexual deviances . "
riga 's roman catholic archbishop , janis pujats , issued a letter this week condemning the parade as " unlawful , " saying it is immoral .
the archbishop condemned homosexuality as going " against the natural order and therefore again the laws of god . "
poland 's tensions still lurking tensions in predominantly catholic poland appeared to have abated after the country 's right-wing government lost elections last year , but they did n't disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent opposition to gays is still evident in some nations pro-gay groups and amnesty international say discrimination based on sexual orientation persists .
warsaw 's gay pride march is planned for june 7 .
in the baltics , homosexuality was outlawed throughout the soviet occupation .
it was decriminalized only after independence in 1991 , but public attitudes have been slow to change .

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "
soft landing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian farmers said they 'd rather give their milk for free than at bargain prices since the eu has decided to scrap all milk quotas in 2015 , it proposes raising the quotas every year until 2014 in an effort to provide a " soft landing " for milk farmers .
as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , right , with gesine schwan , the spd 's candidate for german president " there is no question of forming a government with -lrb- the left -rrb- , nor any acceptance of support from it , because this party is totally at odds with our basic convictions , " beck said .
flirting with the left the spd , a member of angela merkel 's ruling left-right coalition , is grappling with a huge popularity slump amid internal bickering over economic policy and the party 's future course .
on friday , an opinion poll showed only 21 percent of germans would vote for the party in next year 's general election , the lowest score since taking office with chancellor angela merkel 's christian union in november 2005 .
merkel 's conservatives were at 42 percent .
leading spd officials have flirted with the left party , which has seats in 10 of germany 's state parliaments and is seen as a growing force on the political scene , turning off many mainstream voters , angering centrist social democrats and risking its credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the left party who have shaken up the political scene beck himself sparked a massive row in february when he sanctioned state-level cooperation with the left , which opposes economic reform and german troop deployments abroad and is in favor of renationalization .
on saturday , in an attempt to draw a line under the disputes , beck vowed the spd would not entertain any notion of cooperating with the left .
" after 2009 , there can not be any formation of a government with or toleration of this grouping -lrb- the left -rrb- , " beck said , adding there were huge policy differences from foreign affairs to economics .
on saturday , beck railed against the left 's planned " spending orgy " in social policies , saying the party promised voters everything .
the spd wants to lower the social security contributions of low-earners and make up for the budgetary shortfall by raising taxes for the wealthy .
looking for a " new direction " on saturday , beck indicated his preference for the free democrats , a traditional coalition partner of the spd , who are also being courted by merkel 's party .
" we are not closing any doors , we are deliberately opening them , " beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant of the spd party congress turned up in a show-stopping hairstyle media reports say the spd has also agreed that it will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and not beck who will be the spd candidate for chancellor against merkel in the september 2009 elections .
this week , the spd put forward its own candidate for german president , a move that has worsened relations with merkel 's conservatives who want a second term for horst koehler .
" it is clear to us all that we must not have a repetition of the last weeks and months , " spd general-secretary hubertus heil told n-24 television .

in moscow , however , the city authorities denied a pro-gay group a permit to march on saturday for the third year in a row .
in the past , gay pride has prompted savage backlashes in the three countries , with marches banned by the authorities and attacked by religious extremists , ultra-nationalists and communists .
in 2005 and 2006 , pro-gay activists in riga were attacked by anti-gay demonstrators who pelted them with eggs , fruit and excrement .
in 2007 , several hundred police , including heavily-armored riot squads , formed a human barrier at the vermanes park in central riga as up to 500 gay activists staged a peaceful " march for equality " inside .
in moscow , organizers have appealed to russian president dmitry medvedev to override the city administration 's ban on the parade .
up to 100 volunteers from amnesty international 's british and scandinavian groups are set to attend events in latvia on saturday , amnesty researcher anders dahlbeck said .
concern over latvian failures latvia 's failure to protect sexual minorities " has been very concerning , and we believe our presence at the march will ensure that the latvian authorities feel obliged to protect the march , including both latvian and international participants , " he told dpa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay rights supporters bring " love " to moscow 's streets members of the danish parliament also plan to act as observers .
" i hope our being there will give the right signal to the troublemakers , " the danish social democrat flemmin moeller mortensen told a danish radio station this week .
the troublemakers are mostly church leaders and politicians that frequently accuse gay activists of being pedophiles , perverts , criminals , drug addicts and mentally ill .
" i do n't think we should allow a small percentage of society to spread their perversion " , " the latvian capital 's deputy mayor andris argalis told leta news agency on wednesday .
" otherwise , we will have to give equal rights to other groups of people with sexual deviances . "
riga 's roman catholic archbishop , janis pujats , issued a letter this week condemning the parade as " unlawful , " saying it is immoral .
the archbishop condemned homosexuality as going " against the natural order and therefore again the laws of god . "
poland 's tensions still lurking tensions in predominantly catholic poland appeared to have abated after the country 's right-wing government lost elections last year , but they did n't disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent opposition to gays is still evident in some nations pro-gay groups and amnesty international say discrimination based on sexual orientation persists .
warsaw 's gay pride march is planned for june 7 .
in the baltics , homosexuality was outlawed throughout the soviet occupation .
it was decriminalized only after independence in 1991 , but public attitudes have been slow to change .
amnesty international also weighed in on lithuania for failing to respect the rights of homosexuals .
lithuania criticized in amnesty report in its 2008 report on the state of human rights worldwide , amnesty said : " lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -lrb- lgbt -rrb- peoples ' human rights were not respected and several lgbt events were cancelled in a discriminatory manner .
-lrb- the lithuanian -rrb- parliament also discussed banning information which would put homosexuality in a positive light to minors . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international 's barbara lochbihler with the report the report also highlighted the decision of vilnius mayor juozas imbrasas to ban an eu-sponsored anti-discrimination truck from coming to the lithuanian capital and to refuse permission for a tolerance campaign rally by homosexuals last may .
it also noted that sexual minorities were refused the right to put social advertising on public transport buses based on imbrasas 's decision to give " priority to the traditional family " and his disapproval for the public display of homosexual ideas in the city .
romanian march goes ahead unhindered despite the seething undercurrent of intolerance still prevalent in eastern europe , public displays of solidarity continue against a backdrop of resentment and threats of violence .
around 200 gay activists marched through bucharest last weekend in a heavily policed pride parade that defied efforts by romanian religious and far-right groups to have the annual event banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers were injured in budapest 's pride march in 2007 romania 's fifth annual gay festival went ahead despite an attempt by anti-gay groups to get a court to rule against the march .
before the pride march took place , two counter-demonstrations were held , including one by a far-right group whose members chanted " romania does not want you " in a protest they said was " against sin . "
romania decriminalized homosexuality in 2001 , but gay people often face hostility in this largely conservative country of 22 million where the powerful orthodox church views homosexuality as a sin and a disease .
there were no reports of violence in contrast to the event in 2007 , when around 1,200 riot police faced an angry mob and detained dozens of protesters who tried to break up the march . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was satisfied with the outcome of the conference the un convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was " alive again and back on the international political agenda , " gabriel said . but environmental organizations greenpeace and the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- expressed scepticism .
the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .
greenpeace and the wwf cast doubt on whether the goal of significantly cutting species loss by 2010 could be reached .
but both organizations welcomed additional funding promised by germany , norway and finland .
a de facto moratorium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gene-manipulated trees were a particular concern for environmental activists gabriel said the conference had secured a " de facto moratorium " on marine fertilization , the controversial practice of seeding the seas with iron filings to promote algae blooms in the hope of absorbing carbon dioxide .
cbd officials warn research is lacking on the impact on marine ecosystems .
gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .
poorer countries with unique natural resources are concerned at the patenting of indigenous remedies by the pharmaceutical industry without payments to the countries where they originate .
greenpeace and the wwf also saw the abs deal as significant progress .
life web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community still has a lot to do to protect endangered species cbd officials applauded significant progress on protected areas , including the initiative put forward by host country germany to set up an internet-based " life web " to link countries offering protected areas with countries prepared to fund them .
" this has been a major step forward , " gabriel said .
more than 30 countries had proposed a total area over land and sea of 68 million hectares - equivalent to one-and-a-half times the area of germany , he said , singling out indonesia , mexico and democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
biofuel still controversial gabriel said that while there had been no substantive agreement on the controversial issue of biofuels , a work programme on the issue had been set up for the two years leading to the nagoya conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .
significant announcements the conference also saw significant announcements from participating countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalist activists made sure their protest was visible brazilian environment minister carlos minc announced four new protected areas , three of them in the amazon basin and stressed his commitment to zero net deforestation by 2020 .
and environment minister jose endundo bononge said drc planned a huge new conservation area of up to 15 billion hectares - or the size of greece .
at a final plenary session continuing into friday evening , conference delegates reached consensus agreement on dozens of changes to the final text , with gabriel finding it necessary to call on some delegations to show flexibility .
the conference is the ninth meeting of the 191 countries participating in the cbd , which was agreed at the 1992 rio earth summit and given added impetus at the johannesburg sustainable development summit a decade later . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , right , with gesine schwan , the spd 's candidate for german president " there is no question of forming a government with -lrb- the left -rrb- , nor any acceptance of support from it , because this party is totally at odds with our basic convictions , " beck said .
flirting with the left the spd , a member of angela merkel 's ruling left-right coalition , is grappling with a huge popularity slump amid internal bickering over economic policy and the party 's future course .
on friday , an opinion poll showed only 21 percent of germans would vote for the party in next year 's general election , the lowest score since taking office with chancellor angela merkel 's christian union in november 2005 .
merkel 's conservatives were at 42 percent .
leading spd officials have flirted with the left party , which has seats in 10 of germany 's state parliaments and is seen as a growing force on the political scene , turning off many mainstream voters , angering centrist social democrats and risking its credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the left party who have shaken up the political scene beck himself sparked a massive row in february when he sanctioned state-level cooperation with the left , which opposes economic reform and german troop deployments abroad and is in favor of renationalization .
on saturday , in an attempt to draw a line under the disputes , beck vowed the spd would not entertain any notion of cooperating with the left .
" after 2009 , there can not be any formation of a government with or toleration of this grouping -lrb- the left -rrb- , " beck said , adding there were huge policy differences from foreign affairs to economics .
on saturday , beck railed against the left 's planned " spending orgy " in social policies , saying the party promised voters everything .
the spd wants to lower the social security contributions of low-earners and make up for the budgetary shortfall by raising taxes for the wealthy .
looking for a " new direction " on saturday , beck indicated his preference for the free democrats , a traditional coalition partner of the spd , who are also being courted by merkel 's party .
" we are not closing any doors , we are deliberately opening them , " beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant of the spd party congress turned up in a show-stopping hairstyle media reports say the spd has also agreed that it will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and not beck who will be the spd candidate for chancellor against merkel in the september 2009 elections .

on friday , an opinion poll showed only 21 percent of germans would vote for the party in next year 's general election , the lowest score since taking office with chancellor angela merkel 's christian union in november 2005 .
merkel 's conservatives were at 42 percent .
leading spd officials have flirted with the left party , which has seats in 10 of germany 's state parliaments and is seen as a growing force on the political scene , turning off many mainstream voters , angering centrist social democrats and risking its credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the left party who have shaken up the political scene beck himself sparked a massive row in february when he sanctioned state-level cooperation with the left , which opposes economic reform and german troop deployments abroad and is in favor of renationalization .
on saturday , in an attempt to draw a line under the disputes , beck vowed the spd would not entertain any notion of cooperating with the left .
" after 2009 , there can not be any formation of a government with or toleration of this grouping -lrb- the left -rrb- , " beck said , adding there were huge policy differences from foreign affairs to economics .
on saturday , beck railed against the left 's planned " spending orgy " in social policies , saying the party promised voters everything .
the spd wants to lower the social security contributions of low-earners and make up for the budgetary shortfall by raising taxes for the wealthy .
looking for a " new direction " on saturday , beck indicated his preference for the free democrats , a traditional coalition partner of the spd , who are also being courted by merkel 's party .
" we are not closing any doors , we are deliberately opening them , " beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant of the spd party congress turned up in a show-stopping hairstyle media reports say the spd has also agreed that it will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and not beck who will be the spd candidate for chancellor against merkel in the september 2009 elections .
this week , the spd put forward its own candidate for german president , a move that has worsened relations with merkel 's conservatives who want a second term for horst koehler .
" it is clear to us all that we must not have a repetition of the last weeks and months , " spd general-secretary hubertus heil told n-24 television .
" now we are looking ahead , the new direction starts here in nuremberg . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ballack electrifies everyone ... he can lead us to the title , " the bild am sonntag sunday paper said in praise of the chelsea midfielder . serbia takes lead serbia , who failed to qualify for euro 2008 , proved an awkward opponent in gelsenkirchen for germany eight days before joachim loew 's side kick off their euro 2008 campaign against poland .
the home crowd were silenced in the 19th minute when an exchange of passes in midfield allowed sasa ilic to split the back four with a pass to bosko jankovic who raced clear to slide the ball between the legs of jens lehmann in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuville scores in the 74th minute , bringing much-needed relief to the german side it was the first chance of the game for serbia , with ilic 's pass exposing exactly the area of defense which had been a concern in tuesday 's 2-2 draw with belarus .

christoph metzelder , who had played only nine games for real madrid this season because of a foot injury , was given another chance to prove his fitness .
germany began strongly and serbia central defender nemanja vidic had to clear off the line from a ballack header in the 14th minute .
gomez was unfortunate not to equalize 10 minutes before the break when he failed to connect properly in front of goal from a jansen cross .
germany also had a strong penalty appeal turned down after torsten frings appeared to be tripped in the box by ilic .
podolski came on at half-time for philipp lahm , moving to the left of midfield as germany pressed for an equalizer , but it was serbia who came closest when jankovic crashed the ball against the bar from close range in the 54th minute .
arne friedrich replaced per mertesacker in central defence at half-time , and further substitutions followed , with simon rolfes coming on for torsten frings , neuville replacing kuranyi in the 70th minute , and bastian schweinsteiger later making way for odonkor .
it was neuville who finally broke the deadlock when he came off the bench in the 70th minute to score from close range four minutes later . ballack in top form after jansen was fouled on the edge of the area by branislav ivanovic , who earned a yellow card , the free-kick was touched to rolfes who teed up ballack to strike a right-foot shot into the corner of the net .

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "
soft landing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian farmers said they 'd rather give their milk for free than at bargain prices since the eu has decided to scrap all milk quotas in 2015 , it proposes raising the quotas every year until 2014 in an effort to provide a " soft landing " for milk farmers .
as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .
the protest organizers - the latvian dairy farmers union - warned that more protests may follow .
in the 1990s , latvians stood in long lines outside grocery stores for a loaf of bread as the small baltic nation struggled for its independence from the soviet union . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government made intense efforts to secure the release of the german national and managed to reach agreement with the us , " a spokesman of the ministry said .
the man was detained at the beginning of january this year in a kabul supermarket on a us base after american officials apparently found him acting suspiciously .
the man , who lives in the city of wuppertal , was visiting relatives at the time .
wrong place at the wrong time the german ambassador to afghanistan , hans-ulrich seidt , who was allowed by us authorities to visit the man in prison months after his capture , had said the ghaus had seemed disoriented .
ghaus ' release on saturday , may 31 , came after months of diplomatic efforts by the german government to get him freed .
german security officials , who investigated ghaus ' family and friends , suspect he was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time and that he at no stage posed a security risk .
the case sparked comparisons with a german of turkish origin , murat kuraz , who was held in the us military 's guantanamo bay camp on cuba for more than four years without ever being charged .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , right , with gesine schwan , the spd 's candidate for german president " there is no question of forming a government with -lrb- the left -rrb- , nor any acceptance of support from it , because this party is totally at odds with our basic convictions , " beck said .
flirting with the left the spd , a member of angela merkel 's ruling left-right coalition , is grappling with a huge popularity slump amid internal bickering over economic policy and the party 's future course .
on friday , an opinion poll showed only 21 percent of germans would vote for the party in next year 's general election , the lowest score since taking office with chancellor angela merkel 's christian union in november 2005 .
merkel 's conservatives were at 42 percent .
leading spd officials have flirted with the left party , which has seats in 10 of germany 's state parliaments and is seen as a growing force on the political scene , turning off many mainstream voters , angering centrist social democrats and risking its credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the left party who have shaken up the political scene beck himself sparked a massive row in february when he sanctioned state-level cooperation with the left , which opposes economic reform and german troop deployments abroad and is in favor of renationalization .
on saturday , in an attempt to draw a line under the disputes , beck vowed the spd would not entertain any notion of cooperating with the left .
" after 2009 , there can not be any formation of a government with or toleration of this grouping -lrb- the left -rrb- , " beck said , adding there were huge policy differences from foreign affairs to economics .
on saturday , beck railed against the left 's planned " spending orgy " in social policies , saying the party promised voters everything .
the spd wants to lower the social security contributions of low-earners and make up for the budgetary shortfall by raising taxes for the wealthy .
looking for a " new direction " on saturday , beck indicated his preference for the free democrats , a traditional coalition partner of the spd , who are also being courted by merkel 's party .
" we are not closing any doors , we are deliberately opening them , " beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant of the spd party congress turned up in a show-stopping hairstyle media reports say the spd has also agreed that it will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and not beck who will be the spd candidate for chancellor against merkel in the september 2009 elections .
this week , the spd put forward its own candidate for german president , a move that has worsened relations with merkel 's conservatives who want a second term for horst koehler .
" it is clear to us all that we must not have a repetition of the last weeks and months , " spd general-secretary hubertus heil told n-24 television .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was satisfied with the outcome of the conference the un convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was " alive again and back on the international political agenda , " gabriel said . but environmental organizations greenpeace and the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- expressed scepticism .
the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .
greenpeace and the wwf cast doubt on whether the goal of significantly cutting species loss by 2010 could be reached .
but both organizations welcomed additional funding promised by germany , norway and finland .
a de facto moratorium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gene-manipulated trees were a particular concern for environmental activists gabriel said the conference had secured a " de facto moratorium " on marine fertilization , the controversial practice of seeding the seas with iron filings to promote algae blooms in the hope of absorbing carbon dioxide .
cbd officials warn research is lacking on the impact on marine ecosystems .
gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .
poorer countries with unique natural resources are concerned at the patenting of indigenous remedies by the pharmaceutical industry without payments to the countries where they originate .
greenpeace and the wwf also saw the abs deal as significant progress .
life web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community still has a lot to do to protect endangered species cbd officials applauded significant progress on protected areas , including the initiative put forward by host country germany to set up an internet-based " life web " to link countries offering protected areas with countries prepared to fund them .
" this has been a major step forward , " gabriel said .
more than 30 countries had proposed a total area over land and sea of 68 million hectares - equivalent to one-and-a-half times the area of germany , he said , singling out indonesia , mexico and democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
biofuel still controversial gabriel said that while there had been no substantive agreement on the controversial issue of biofuels , a work programme on the issue had been set up for the two years leading to the nagoya conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .
significant announcements the conference also saw significant announcements from participating countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalist activists made sure their protest was visible brazilian environment minister carlos minc announced four new protected areas , three of them in the amazon basin and stressed his commitment to zero net deforestation by 2020 .
and environment minister jose endundo bononge said drc planned a huge new conservation area of up to 15 billion hectares - or the size of greece .
at a final plenary session continuing into friday evening , conference delegates reached consensus agreement on dozens of changes to the final text , with gabriel finding it necessary to call on some delegations to show flexibility .
the conference is the ninth meeting of the 191 countries participating in the cbd , which was agreed at the 1992 rio earth summit and given added impetus at the johannesburg sustainable development summit a decade later . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .
greenpeace and the wwf cast doubt on whether the goal of significantly cutting species loss by 2010 could be reached .

cbd officials warn research is lacking on the impact on marine ecosystems .
gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .

" this has been a major step forward , " gabriel said .
more than 30 countries had proposed a total area over land and sea of 68 million hectares - equivalent to one-and-a-half times the area of germany , he said , singling out indonesia , mexico and democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
biofuel still controversial gabriel said that while there had been no substantive agreement on the controversial issue of biofuels , a work programme on the issue had been set up for the two years leading to the nagoya conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "
soft landing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian farmers said they 'd rather give their milk for free than at bargain prices since the eu has decided to scrap all milk quotas in 2015 , it proposes raising the quotas every year until 2014 in an effort to provide a " soft landing " for milk farmers .
as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .
the protest organizers - the latvian dairy farmers union - warned that more protests may follow .
in the 1990s , latvians stood in long lines outside grocery stores for a loaf of bread as the small baltic nation struggled for its independence from the soviet union . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was satisfied with the outcome of the conference the un convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was " alive again and back on the international political agenda , " gabriel said . but environmental organizations greenpeace and the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- expressed scepticism .
the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .
greenpeace and the wwf cast doubt on whether the goal of significantly cutting species loss by 2010 could be reached .
but both organizations welcomed additional funding promised by germany , norway and finland .
a de facto moratorium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gene-manipulated trees were a particular concern for environmental activists gabriel said the conference had secured a " de facto moratorium " on marine fertilization , the controversial practice of seeding the seas with iron filings to promote algae blooms in the hope of absorbing carbon dioxide .
cbd officials warn research is lacking on the impact on marine ecosystems .
gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .
poorer countries with unique natural resources are concerned at the patenting of indigenous remedies by the pharmaceutical industry without payments to the countries where they originate .
greenpeace and the wwf also saw the abs deal as significant progress .
life web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community still has a lot to do to protect endangered species cbd officials applauded significant progress on protected areas , including the initiative put forward by host country germany to set up an internet-based " life web " to link countries offering protected areas with countries prepared to fund them .
" this has been a major step forward , " gabriel said .
more than 30 countries had proposed a total area over land and sea of 68 million hectares - equivalent to one-and-a-half times the area of germany , he said , singling out indonesia , mexico and democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
biofuel still controversial gabriel said that while there had been no substantive agreement on the controversial issue of biofuels , a work programme on the issue had been set up for the two years leading to the nagoya conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .
significant announcements the conference also saw significant announcements from participating countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalist activists made sure their protest was visible brazilian environment minister carlos minc announced four new protected areas , three of them in the amazon basin and stressed his commitment to zero net deforestation by 2020 .
and environment minister jose endundo bononge said drc planned a huge new conservation area of up to 15 billion hectares - or the size of greece .
at a final plenary session continuing into friday evening , conference delegates reached consensus agreement on dozens of changes to the final text , with gabriel finding it necessary to call on some delegations to show flexibility .
the conference is the ninth meeting of the 191 countries participating in the cbd , which was agreed at the 1992 rio earth summit and given added impetus at the johannesburg sustainable development summit a decade later . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was satisfied with the outcome of the conference the un convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was " alive again and back on the international political agenda , " gabriel said . but environmental organizations greenpeace and the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- expressed scepticism .
the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .
greenpeace and the wwf cast doubt on whether the goal of significantly cutting species loss by 2010 could be reached .
but both organizations welcomed additional funding promised by germany , norway and finland .
a de facto moratorium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gene-manipulated trees were a particular concern for environmental activists gabriel said the conference had secured a " de facto moratorium " on marine fertilization , the controversial practice of seeding the seas with iron filings to promote algae blooms in the hope of absorbing carbon dioxide .
cbd officials warn research is lacking on the impact on marine ecosystems .
gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .
poorer countries with unique natural resources are concerned at the patenting of indigenous remedies by the pharmaceutical industry without payments to the countries where they originate .
greenpeace and the wwf also saw the abs deal as significant progress .

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .

as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .

later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , right , with gesine schwan , the spd 's candidate for german president " there is no question of forming a government with -lrb- the left -rrb- , nor any acceptance of support from it , because this party is totally at odds with our basic convictions , " beck said .
flirting with the left the spd , a member of angela merkel 's ruling left-right coalition , is grappling with a huge popularity slump amid internal bickering over economic policy and the party 's future course .
on friday , an opinion poll showed only 21 percent of germans would vote for the party in next year 's general election , the lowest score since taking office with chancellor angela merkel 's christian union in november 2005 .
merkel 's conservatives were at 42 percent .
leading spd officials have flirted with the left party , which has seats in 10 of germany 's state parliaments and is seen as a growing force on the political scene , turning off many mainstream voters , angering centrist social democrats and risking its credibility .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , right , with gesine schwan , the spd 's candidate for german president " there is no question of forming a government with -lrb- the left -rrb- , nor any acceptance of support from it , because this party is totally at odds with our basic convictions , " beck said .
flirting with the left the spd , a member of angela merkel 's ruling left-right coalition , is grappling with a huge popularity slump amid internal bickering over economic policy and the party 's future course .
on friday , an opinion poll showed only 21 percent of germans would vote for the party in next year 's general election , the lowest score since taking office with chancellor angela merkel 's christian union in november 2005 .
merkel 's conservatives were at 42 percent .
leading spd officials have flirted with the left party , which has seats in 10 of germany 's state parliaments and is seen as a growing force on the political scene , turning off many mainstream voters , angering centrist social democrats and risking its credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the left party who have shaken up the political scene beck himself sparked a massive row in february when he sanctioned state-level cooperation with the left , which opposes economic reform and german troop deployments abroad and is in favor of renationalization .
on saturday , in an attempt to draw a line under the disputes , beck vowed the spd would not entertain any notion of cooperating with the left .
" after 2009 , there can not be any formation of a government with or toleration of this grouping -lrb- the left -rrb- , " beck said , adding there were huge policy differences from foreign affairs to economics .
on saturday , beck railed against the left 's planned " spending orgy " in social policies , saying the party promised voters everything .
the spd wants to lower the social security contributions of low-earners and make up for the budgetary shortfall by raising taxes for the wealthy .
looking for a " new direction " on saturday , beck indicated his preference for the free democrats , a traditional coalition partner of the spd , who are also being courted by merkel 's party .
" we are not closing any doors , we are deliberately opening them , " beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant of the spd party congress turned up in a show-stopping hairstyle media reports say the spd has also agreed that it will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and not beck who will be the spd candidate for chancellor against merkel in the september 2009 elections .
this week , the spd put forward its own candidate for german president , a move that has worsened relations with merkel 's conservatives who want a second term for horst koehler .
" it is clear to us all that we must not have a repetition of the last weeks and months , " spd general-secretary hubertus heil told n-24 television .

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .

" ballack electrifies everyone ... he can lead us to the title , " the bild am sonntag sunday paper said in praise of the chelsea midfielder . serbia takes lead serbia , who failed to qualify for euro 2008 , proved an awkward opponent in gelsenkirchen for germany eight days before joachim loew 's side kick off their euro 2008 campaign against poland .
the home crowd were silenced in the 19th minute when an exchange of passes in midfield allowed sasa ilic to split the back four with a pass to bosko jankovic who raced clear to slide the ball between the legs of jens lehmann in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuville scores in the 74th minute , bringing much-needed relief to the german side it was the first chance of the game for serbia , with ilic 's pass exposing exactly the area of defense which had been a concern in tuesday 's 2-2 draw with belarus .
neuville breaks deadlock loew made four changes from the team which drew 2-2 with belarus on tuesday , bringing in marcell jansen at left-back , clemens fritz on the right of midfield and kevin kuranyi and mario gomez in attack .
christoph metzelder , who had played only nine games for real madrid this season because of a foot injury , was given another chance to prove his fitness .
germany began strongly and serbia central defender nemanja vidic had to clear off the line from a ballack header in the 14th minute .
gomez was unfortunate not to equalize 10 minutes before the break when he failed to connect properly in front of goal from a jansen cross .
germany also had a strong penalty appeal turned down after torsten frings appeared to be tripped in the box by ilic .
podolski came on at half-time for philipp lahm , moving to the left of midfield as germany pressed for an equalizer , but it was serbia who came closest when jankovic crashed the ball against the bar from close range in the 54th minute .
arne friedrich replaced per mertesacker in central defence at half-time , and further substitutions followed , with simon rolfes coming on for torsten frings , neuville replacing kuranyi in the 70th minute , and bastian schweinsteiger later making way for odonkor .
it was neuville who finally broke the deadlock when he came off the bench in the 70th minute to score from close range four minutes later . ballack in top form after jansen was fouled on the edge of the area by branislav ivanovic , who earned a yellow card , the free-kick was touched to rolfes who teed up ballack to strike a right-foot shot into the corner of the net .
germany coach joachim loew heaped praise on his key player . " michael ballack permanently led the team on the attack .
he is in great shape .
he scored a deciding goal .
he had a strong presence on the field , " said loew . ballack , who is still in search of his firsdt major trophy , could make the difference for the three-time champion germany at the june 7-29 tournament in austria and switzerland . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government made intense efforts to secure the release of the german national and managed to reach agreement with the us , " a spokesman of the ministry said .
the man was detained at the beginning of january this year in a kabul supermarket on a us base after american officials apparently found him acting suspiciously .
the man , who lives in the city of wuppertal , was visiting relatives at the time .
wrong place at the wrong time the german ambassador to afghanistan , hans-ulrich seidt , who was allowed by us authorities to visit the man in prison months after his capture , had said the ghaus had seemed disoriented .
ghaus ' release on saturday , may 31 , came after months of diplomatic efforts by the german government to get him freed .
german security officials , who investigated ghaus ' family and friends , suspect he was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time and that he at no stage posed a security risk .
the case sparked comparisons with a german of turkish origin , murat kuraz , who was held in the us military 's guantanamo bay camp on cuba for more than four years without ever being charged .
kurnaz was just 19 at the time of his arrest in afghanistan . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government made intense efforts to secure the release of the german national and managed to reach agreement with the us , " a spokesman of the ministry said .
the man was detained at the beginning of january this year in a kabul supermarket on a us base after american officials apparently found him acting suspiciously .
the man , who lives in the city of wuppertal , was visiting relatives at the time .
wrong place at the wrong time the german ambassador to afghanistan , hans-ulrich seidt , who was allowed by us authorities to visit the man in prison months after his capture , had said the ghaus had seemed disoriented .
ghaus ' release on saturday , may 31 , came after months of diplomatic efforts by the german government to get him freed .
german security officials , who investigated ghaus ' family and friends , suspect he was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time and that he at no stage posed a security risk .
the case sparked comparisons with a german of turkish origin , murat kuraz , who was held in the us military 's guantanamo bay camp on cuba for more than four years without ever being charged .
kurnaz was just 19 at the time of his arrest in afghanistan . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "
soft landing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian farmers said they 'd rather give their milk for free than at bargain prices since the eu has decided to scrap all milk quotas in 2015 , it proposes raising the quotas every year until 2014 in an effort to provide a " soft landing " for milk farmers .
as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .
the protest organizers - the latvian dairy farmers union - warned that more protests may follow .
in the 1990s , latvians stood in long lines outside grocery stores for a loaf of bread as the small baltic nation struggled for its independence from the soviet union . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "
soft landing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian farmers said they 'd rather give their milk for free than at bargain prices since the eu has decided to scrap all milk quotas in 2015 , it proposes raising the quotas every year until 2014 in an effort to provide a " soft landing " for milk farmers .
as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .
the protest organizers - the latvian dairy farmers union - warned that more protests may follow .
in the 1990s , latvians stood in long lines outside grocery stores for a loaf of bread as the small baltic nation struggled for its independence from the soviet union . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "
soft landing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian farmers said they 'd rather give their milk for free than at bargain prices since the eu has decided to scrap all milk quotas in 2015 , it proposes raising the quotas every year until 2014 in an effort to provide a " soft landing " for milk farmers .
as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .
the protest organizers - the latvian dairy farmers union - warned that more protests may follow .
in the 1990s , latvians stood in long lines outside grocery stores for a loaf of bread as the small baltic nation struggled for its independence from the soviet union . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 31.05.2008 germany 's social democrats struggle to shake off crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's spd hope to draw a line under damaging rows that have riven the party germany 's social democrats ruled out working with a far left party after next year 's federal election as they sought a way out of an internal crisis saturday which has sent their popularity plunging . speaking to some 3,000 delegates gathered in the bavarian city of nuremberg on saturday , may 31 for a party congress , the leader of germany 's embattled social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck said there was no way the party would form a future national government with the left party , an anti-reform group that includes disaffected former social democrats and former east german communists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , right , with gesine schwan , the spd 's candidate for german president " there is no question of forming a government with -lrb- the left -rrb- , nor any acceptance of support from it , because this party is totally at odds with our basic convictions , " beck said .
flirting with the left the spd , a member of angela merkel 's ruling left-right coalition , is grappling with a huge popularity slump amid internal bickering over economic policy and the party 's future course .
on friday , an opinion poll showed only 21 percent of germans would vote for the party in next year 's general election , the lowest score since taking office with chancellor angela merkel 's christian union in november 2005 .
merkel 's conservatives were at 42 percent .
leading spd officials have flirted with the left party , which has seats in 10 of germany 's state parliaments and is seen as a growing force on the political scene , turning off many mainstream voters , angering centrist social democrats and risking its credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the left party who have shaken up the political scene beck himself sparked a massive row in february when he sanctioned state-level cooperation with the left , which opposes economic reform and german troop deployments abroad and is in favor of renationalization .
on saturday , in an attempt to draw a line under the disputes , beck vowed the spd would not entertain any notion of cooperating with the left .
" after 2009 , there can not be any formation of a government with or toleration of this grouping -lrb- the left -rrb- , " beck said , adding there were huge policy differences from foreign affairs to economics .
on saturday , beck railed against the left 's planned " spending orgy " in social policies , saying the party promised voters everything .
the spd wants to lower the social security contributions of low-earners and make up for the budgetary shortfall by raising taxes for the wealthy .
looking for a " new direction " on saturday , beck indicated his preference for the free democrats , a traditional coalition partner of the spd , who are also being courted by merkel 's party .
" we are not closing any doors , we are deliberately opening them , " beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant of the spd party congress turned up in a show-stopping hairstyle media reports say the spd has also agreed that it will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and not beck who will be the spd candidate for chancellor against merkel in the september 2009 elections .
this week , the spd put forward its own candidate for german president , a move that has worsened relations with merkel 's conservatives who want a second term for horst koehler .
" it is clear to us all that we must not have a repetition of the last weeks and months , " spd general-secretary hubertus heil told n-24 television .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was satisfied with the outcome of the conference the un convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was " alive again and back on the international political agenda , " gabriel said . but environmental organizations greenpeace and the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- expressed scepticism .
the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .
greenpeace and the wwf cast doubt on whether the goal of significantly cutting species loss by 2010 could be reached .
but both organizations welcomed additional funding promised by germany , norway and finland .
a de facto moratorium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gene-manipulated trees were a particular concern for environmental activists gabriel said the conference had secured a " de facto moratorium " on marine fertilization , the controversial practice of seeding the seas with iron filings to promote algae blooms in the hope of absorbing carbon dioxide .
cbd officials warn research is lacking on the impact on marine ecosystems .
gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .
poorer countries with unique natural resources are concerned at the patenting of indigenous remedies by the pharmaceutical industry without payments to the countries where they originate .
greenpeace and the wwf also saw the abs deal as significant progress .
life web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community still has a lot to do to protect endangered species cbd officials applauded significant progress on protected areas , including the initiative put forward by host country germany to set up an internet-based " life web " to link countries offering protected areas with countries prepared to fund them .
" this has been a major step forward , " gabriel said .
more than 30 countries had proposed a total area over land and sea of 68 million hectares - equivalent to one-and-a-half times the area of germany , he said , singling out indonesia , mexico and democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
biofuel still controversial gabriel said that while there had been no substantive agreement on the controversial issue of biofuels , a work programme on the issue had been set up for the two years leading to the nagoya conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .
significant announcements the conference also saw significant announcements from participating countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalist activists made sure their protest was visible brazilian environment minister carlos minc announced four new protected areas , three of them in the amazon basin and stressed his commitment to zero net deforestation by 2020 .
and environment minister jose endundo bononge said drc planned a huge new conservation area of up to 15 billion hectares - or the size of greece .
at a final plenary session continuing into friday evening , conference delegates reached consensus agreement on dozens of changes to the final text , with gabriel finding it necessary to call on some delegations to show flexibility .

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "
soft landing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian farmers said they 'd rather give their milk for free than at bargain prices since the eu has decided to scrap all milk quotas in 2015 , it proposes raising the quotas every year until 2014 in an effort to provide a " soft landing " for milk farmers .
as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .
the protest organizers - the latvian dairy farmers union - warned that more protests may follow .
in the 1990s , latvians stood in long lines outside grocery stores for a loaf of bread as the small baltic nation struggled for its independence from the soviet union . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , right , with gesine schwan , the spd 's candidate for german president " there is no question of forming a government with -lrb- the left -rrb- , nor any acceptance of support from it , because this party is totally at odds with our basic convictions , " beck said .
flirting with the left the spd , a member of angela merkel 's ruling left-right coalition , is grappling with a huge popularity slump amid internal bickering over economic policy and the party 's future course .
on friday , an opinion poll showed only 21 percent of germans would vote for the party in next year 's general election , the lowest score since taking office with chancellor angela merkel 's christian union in november 2005 .
merkel 's conservatives were at 42 percent .
leading spd officials have flirted with the left party , which has seats in 10 of germany 's state parliaments and is seen as a growing force on the political scene , turning off many mainstream voters , angering centrist social democrats and risking its credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the left party who have shaken up the political scene beck himself sparked a massive row in february when he sanctioned state-level cooperation with the left , which opposes economic reform and german troop deployments abroad and is in favor of renationalization .
on saturday , in an attempt to draw a line under the disputes , beck vowed the spd would not entertain any notion of cooperating with the left .
" after 2009 , there can not be any formation of a government with or toleration of this grouping -lrb- the left -rrb- , " beck said , adding there were huge policy differences from foreign affairs to economics .
on saturday , beck railed against the left 's planned " spending orgy " in social policies , saying the party promised voters everything .
the spd wants to lower the social security contributions of low-earners and make up for the budgetary shortfall by raising taxes for the wealthy .
looking for a " new direction " on saturday , beck indicated his preference for the free democrats , a traditional coalition partner of the spd , who are also being courted by merkel 's party .
" we are not closing any doors , we are deliberately opening them , " beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant of the spd party congress turned up in a show-stopping hairstyle media reports say the spd has also agreed that it will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and not beck who will be the spd candidate for chancellor against merkel in the september 2009 elections .
this week , the spd put forward its own candidate for german president , a move that has worsened relations with merkel 's conservatives who want a second term for horst koehler .
" it is clear to us all that we must not have a repetition of the last weeks and months , " spd general-secretary hubertus heil told n-24 television .

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "
soft landing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian farmers said they 'd rather give their milk for free than at bargain prices since the eu has decided to scrap all milk quotas in 2015 , it proposes raising the quotas every year until 2014 in an effort to provide a " soft landing " for milk farmers .
as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .
the protest organizers - the latvian dairy farmers union - warned that more protests may follow .

" ballack electrifies everyone ... he can lead us to the title , " the bild am sonntag sunday paper said in praise of the chelsea midfielder . serbia takes lead serbia , who failed to qualify for euro 2008 , proved an awkward opponent in gelsenkirchen for germany eight days before joachim loew 's side kick off their euro 2008 campaign against poland .
the home crowd were silenced in the 19th minute when an exchange of passes in midfield allowed sasa ilic to split the back four with a pass to bosko jankovic who raced clear to slide the ball between the legs of jens lehmann in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuville scores in the 74th minute , bringing much-needed relief to the german side it was the first chance of the game for serbia , with ilic 's pass exposing exactly the area of defense which had been a concern in tuesday 's 2-2 draw with belarus .
neuville breaks deadlock loew made four changes from the team which drew 2-2 with belarus on tuesday , bringing in marcell jansen at left-back , clemens fritz on the right of midfield and kevin kuranyi and mario gomez in attack .
christoph metzelder , who had played only nine games for real madrid this season because of a foot injury , was given another chance to prove his fitness .
germany began strongly and serbia central defender nemanja vidic had to clear off the line from a ballack header in the 14th minute .
gomez was unfortunate not to equalize 10 minutes before the break when he failed to connect properly in front of goal from a jansen cross .
germany also had a strong penalty appeal turned down after torsten frings appeared to be tripped in the box by ilic .
podolski came on at half-time for philipp lahm , moving to the left of midfield as germany pressed for an equalizer , but it was serbia who came closest when jankovic crashed the ball against the bar from close range in the 54th minute .
arne friedrich replaced per mertesacker in central defence at half-time , and further substitutions followed , with simon rolfes coming on for torsten frings , neuville replacing kuranyi in the 70th minute , and bastian schweinsteiger later making way for odonkor .
it was neuville who finally broke the deadlock when he came off the bench in the 70th minute to score from close range four minutes later . ballack in top form after jansen was fouled on the edge of the area by branislav ivanovic , who earned a yellow card , the free-kick was touched to rolfes who teed up ballack to strike a right-foot shot into the corner of the net .
germany coach joachim loew heaped praise on his key player . " michael ballack permanently led the team on the attack .
he is in great shape .
he scored a deciding goal .
he had a strong presence on the field , " said loew . ballack , who is still in search of his firsdt major trophy , could make the difference for the three-time champion germany at the june 7-29 tournament in austria and switzerland . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in moscow , however , the city authorities denied a pro-gay group a permit to march on saturday for the third year in a row .
in the past , gay pride has prompted savage backlashes in the three countries , with marches banned by the authorities and attacked by religious extremists , ultra-nationalists and communists .
in 2005 and 2006 , pro-gay activists in riga were attacked by anti-gay demonstrators who pelted them with eggs , fruit and excrement .
in 2007 , several hundred police , including heavily-armored riot squads , formed a human barrier at the vermanes park in central riga as up to 500 gay activists staged a peaceful " march for equality " inside .
in moscow , organizers have appealed to russian president dmitry medvedev to override the city administration 's ban on the parade .
up to 100 volunteers from amnesty international 's british and scandinavian groups are set to attend events in latvia on saturday , amnesty researcher anders dahlbeck said .

" i hope our being there will give the right signal to the troublemakers , " the danish social democrat flemmin moeller mortensen told a danish radio station this week .
the troublemakers are mostly church leaders and politicians that frequently accuse gay activists of being pedophiles , perverts , criminals , drug addicts and mentally ill .
" i do n't think we should allow a small percentage of society to spread their perversion " , " the latvian capital 's deputy mayor andris argalis told leta news agency on wednesday .
" otherwise , we will have to give equal rights to other groups of people with sexual deviances . "
riga 's roman catholic archbishop , janis pujats , issued a letter this week condemning the parade as " unlawful , " saying it is immoral .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was satisfied with the outcome of the conference the un convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was " alive again and back on the international political agenda , " gabriel said . but environmental organizations greenpeace and the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- expressed scepticism .
the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .
greenpeace and the wwf cast doubt on whether the goal of significantly cutting species loss by 2010 could be reached .
but both organizations welcomed additional funding promised by germany , norway and finland .
a de facto moratorium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gene-manipulated trees were a particular concern for environmental activists gabriel said the conference had secured a " de facto moratorium " on marine fertilization , the controversial practice of seeding the seas with iron filings to promote algae blooms in the hope of absorbing carbon dioxide .
cbd officials warn research is lacking on the impact on marine ecosystems .
gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .
poorer countries with unique natural resources are concerned at the patenting of indigenous remedies by the pharmaceutical industry without payments to the countries where they originate .
greenpeace and the wwf also saw the abs deal as significant progress .
life web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community still has a lot to do to protect endangered species cbd officials applauded significant progress on protected areas , including the initiative put forward by host country germany to set up an internet-based " life web " to link countries offering protected areas with countries prepared to fund them .
" this has been a major step forward , " gabriel said .
more than 30 countries had proposed a total area over land and sea of 68 million hectares - equivalent to one-and-a-half times the area of germany , he said , singling out indonesia , mexico and democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
biofuel still controversial gabriel said that while there had been no substantive agreement on the controversial issue of biofuels , a work programme on the issue had been set up for the two years leading to the nagoya conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .
significant announcements the conference also saw significant announcements from participating countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalist activists made sure their protest was visible brazilian environment minister carlos minc announced four new protected areas , three of them in the amazon basin and stressed his commitment to zero net deforestation by 2020 .
and environment minister jose endundo bononge said drc planned a huge new conservation area of up to 15 billion hectares - or the size of greece .
at a final plenary session continuing into friday evening , conference delegates reached consensus agreement on dozens of changes to the final text , with gabriel finding it necessary to call on some delegations to show flexibility .
the conference is the ninth meeting of the 191 countries participating in the cbd , which was agreed at the 1992 rio earth summit and given added impetus at the johannesburg sustainable development summit a decade later . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , right , with gesine schwan , the spd 's candidate for german president " there is no question of forming a government with -lrb- the left -rrb- , nor any acceptance of support from it , because this party is totally at odds with our basic convictions , " beck said .
flirting with the left the spd , a member of angela merkel 's ruling left-right coalition , is grappling with a huge popularity slump amid internal bickering over economic policy and the party 's future course .
on friday , an opinion poll showed only 21 percent of germans would vote for the party in next year 's general election , the lowest score since taking office with chancellor angela merkel 's christian union in november 2005 .
merkel 's conservatives were at 42 percent .

" after 2009 , there can not be any formation of a government with or toleration of this grouping -lrb- the left -rrb- , " beck said , adding there were huge policy differences from foreign affairs to economics .
on saturday , beck railed against the left 's planned " spending orgy " in social policies , saying the party promised voters everything .
the spd wants to lower the social security contributions of low-earners and make up for the budgetary shortfall by raising taxes for the wealthy .
looking for a " new direction " on saturday , beck indicated his preference for the free democrats , a traditional coalition partner of the spd , who are also being courted by merkel 's party .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , right , with gesine schwan , the spd 's candidate for german president " there is no question of forming a government with -lrb- the left -rrb- , nor any acceptance of support from it , because this party is totally at odds with our basic convictions , " beck said .
flirting with the left the spd , a member of angela merkel 's ruling left-right coalition , is grappling with a huge popularity slump amid internal bickering over economic policy and the party 's future course .
on friday , an opinion poll showed only 21 percent of germans would vote for the party in next year 's general election , the lowest score since taking office with chancellor angela merkel 's christian union in november 2005 .
merkel 's conservatives were at 42 percent .
leading spd officials have flirted with the left party , which has seats in 10 of germany 's state parliaments and is seen as a growing force on the political scene , turning off many mainstream voters , angering centrist social democrats and risking its credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the left party who have shaken up the political scene beck himself sparked a massive row in february when he sanctioned state-level cooperation with the left , which opposes economic reform and german troop deployments abroad and is in favor of renationalization .
on saturday , in an attempt to draw a line under the disputes , beck vowed the spd would not entertain any notion of cooperating with the left .
" after 2009 , there can not be any formation of a government with or toleration of this grouping -lrb- the left -rrb- , " beck said , adding there were huge policy differences from foreign affairs to economics .
on saturday , beck railed against the left 's planned " spending orgy " in social policies , saying the party promised voters everything .
the spd wants to lower the social security contributions of low-earners and make up for the budgetary shortfall by raising taxes for the wealthy .
looking for a " new direction " on saturday , beck indicated his preference for the free democrats , a traditional coalition partner of the spd , who are also being courted by merkel 's party .
" we are not closing any doors , we are deliberately opening them , " beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant of the spd party congress turned up in a show-stopping hairstyle media reports say the spd has also agreed that it will be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and not beck who will be the spd candidate for chancellor against merkel in the september 2009 elections .
this week , the spd put forward its own candidate for german president , a move that has worsened relations with merkel 's conservatives who want a second term for horst koehler .
" it is clear to us all that we must not have a repetition of the last weeks and months , " spd general-secretary hubertus heil told n-24 television .
" now we are looking ahead , the new direction starts here in nuremberg . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in moscow , however , the city authorities denied a pro-gay group a permit to march on saturday for the third year in a row .
in the past , gay pride has prompted savage backlashes in the three countries , with marches banned by the authorities and attacked by religious extremists , ultra-nationalists and communists .
in 2005 and 2006 , pro-gay activists in riga were attacked by anti-gay demonstrators who pelted them with eggs , fruit and excrement .
in 2007 , several hundred police , including heavily-armored riot squads , formed a human barrier at the vermanes park in central riga as up to 500 gay activists staged a peaceful " march for equality " inside .
in moscow , organizers have appealed to russian president dmitry medvedev to override the city administration 's ban on the parade .
up to 100 volunteers from amnesty international 's british and scandinavian groups are set to attend events in latvia on saturday , amnesty researcher anders dahlbeck said .
concern over latvian failures latvia 's failure to protect sexual minorities " has been very concerning , and we believe our presence at the march will ensure that the latvian authorities feel obliged to protect the march , including both latvian and international participants , " he told dpa .

" i hope our being there will give the right signal to the troublemakers , " the danish social democrat flemmin moeller mortensen told a danish radio station this week .
the troublemakers are mostly church leaders and politicians that frequently accuse gay activists of being pedophiles , perverts , criminals , drug addicts and mentally ill .
" i do n't think we should allow a small percentage of society to spread their perversion " , " the latvian capital 's deputy mayor andris argalis told leta news agency on wednesday .
" otherwise , we will have to give equal rights to other groups of people with sexual deviances . "
riga 's roman catholic archbishop , janis pujats , issued a letter this week condemning the parade as " unlawful , " saying it is immoral .
the archbishop condemned homosexuality as going " against the natural order and therefore again the laws of god . "

warsaw 's gay pride march is planned for june 7 .
in the baltics , homosexuality was outlawed throughout the soviet occupation .
it was decriminalized only after independence in 1991 , but public attitudes have been slow to change .
amnesty international also weighed in on lithuania for failing to respect the rights of homosexuals .
lithuania criticized in amnesty report in its 2008 report on the state of human rights worldwide , amnesty said : " lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -lrb- lgbt -rrb- peoples ' human rights were not respected and several lgbt events were cancelled in a discriminatory manner .

it also noted that sexual minorities were refused the right to put social advertising on public transport buses based on imbrasas 's decision to give " priority to the traditional family " and his disapproval for the public display of homosexual ideas in the city .
romanian march goes ahead unhindered despite the seething undercurrent of intolerance still prevalent in eastern europe , public displays of solidarity continue against a backdrop of resentment and threats of violence .
around 200 gay activists marched through bucharest last weekend in a heavily policed pride parade that defied efforts by romanian religious and far-right groups to have the annual event banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers were injured in budapest 's pride march in 2007 romania 's fifth annual gay festival went ahead despite an attempt by anti-gay groups to get a court to rule against the march .

romania decriminalized homosexuality in 2001 , but gay people often face hostility in this largely conservative country of 22 million where the powerful orthodox church views homosexuality as a sin and a disease .

in moscow , however , the city authorities denied a pro-gay group a permit to march on saturday for the third year in a row .
in the past , gay pride has prompted savage backlashes in the three countries , with marches banned by the authorities and attacked by religious extremists , ultra-nationalists and communists .
in 2005 and 2006 , pro-gay activists in riga were attacked by anti-gay demonstrators who pelted them with eggs , fruit and excrement .
in 2007 , several hundred police , including heavily-armored riot squads , formed a human barrier at the vermanes park in central riga as up to 500 gay activists staged a peaceful " march for equality " inside .
in moscow , organizers have appealed to russian president dmitry medvedev to override the city administration 's ban on the parade .
up to 100 volunteers from amnesty international 's british and scandinavian groups are set to attend events in latvia on saturday , amnesty researcher anders dahlbeck said .
concern over latvian failures latvia 's failure to protect sexual minorities " has been very concerning , and we believe our presence at the march will ensure that the latvian authorities feel obliged to protect the march , including both latvian and international participants , " he told dpa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay rights supporters bring " love " to moscow 's streets members of the danish parliament also plan to act as observers .
" i hope our being there will give the right signal to the troublemakers , " the danish social democrat flemmin moeller mortensen told a danish radio station this week .
the troublemakers are mostly church leaders and politicians that frequently accuse gay activists of being pedophiles , perverts , criminals , drug addicts and mentally ill .
" i do n't think we should allow a small percentage of society to spread their perversion " , " the latvian capital 's deputy mayor andris argalis told leta news agency on wednesday .
" otherwise , we will have to give equal rights to other groups of people with sexual deviances . "
riga 's roman catholic archbishop , janis pujats , issued a letter this week condemning the parade as " unlawful , " saying it is immoral .
the archbishop condemned homosexuality as going " against the natural order and therefore again the laws of god . "
poland 's tensions still lurking tensions in predominantly catholic poland appeared to have abated after the country 's right-wing government lost elections last year , but they did n't disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent opposition to gays is still evident in some nations pro-gay groups and amnesty international say discrimination based on sexual orientation persists .
warsaw 's gay pride march is planned for june 7 .
in the baltics , homosexuality was outlawed throughout the soviet occupation .
it was decriminalized only after independence in 1991 , but public attitudes have been slow to change .
amnesty international also weighed in on lithuania for failing to respect the rights of homosexuals .
lithuania criticized in amnesty report in its 2008 report on the state of human rights worldwide , amnesty said : " lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -lrb- lgbt -rrb- peoples ' human rights were not respected and several lgbt events were cancelled in a discriminatory manner .
-lrb- the lithuanian -rrb- parliament also discussed banning information which would put homosexuality in a positive light to minors . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international 's barbara lochbihler with the report the report also highlighted the decision of vilnius mayor juozas imbrasas to ban an eu-sponsored anti-discrimination truck from coming to the lithuanian capital and to refuse permission for a tolerance campaign rally by homosexuals last may .
it also noted that sexual minorities were refused the right to put social advertising on public transport buses based on imbrasas 's decision to give " priority to the traditional family " and his disapproval for the public display of homosexual ideas in the city .
romanian march goes ahead unhindered despite the seething undercurrent of intolerance still prevalent in eastern europe , public displays of solidarity continue against a backdrop of resentment and threats of violence .
around 200 gay activists marched through bucharest last weekend in a heavily policed pride parade that defied efforts by romanian religious and far-right groups to have the annual event banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers were injured in budapest 's pride march in 2007 romania 's fifth annual gay festival went ahead despite an attempt by anti-gay groups to get a court to rule against the march .
before the pride march took place , two counter-demonstrations were held , including one by a far-right group whose members chanted " romania does not want you " in a protest they said was " against sin . "
romania decriminalized homosexuality in 2001 , but gay people often face hostility in this largely conservative country of 22 million where the powerful orthodox church views homosexuality as a sin and a disease .
there were no reports of violence in contrast to the event in 2007 , when around 1,200 riot police faced an angry mob and detained dozens of protesters who tried to break up the march . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was satisfied with the outcome of the conference the un convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was " alive again and back on the international political agenda , " gabriel said . but environmental organizations greenpeace and the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- expressed scepticism .
the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .
greenpeace and the wwf cast doubt on whether the goal of significantly cutting species loss by 2010 could be reached .
but both organizations welcomed additional funding promised by germany , norway and finland .
a de facto moratorium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gene-manipulated trees were a particular concern for environmental activists gabriel said the conference had secured a " de facto moratorium " on marine fertilization , the controversial practice of seeding the seas with iron filings to promote algae blooms in the hope of absorbing carbon dioxide .
cbd officials warn research is lacking on the impact on marine ecosystems .
gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .
poorer countries with unique natural resources are concerned at the patenting of indigenous remedies by the pharmaceutical industry without payments to the countries where they originate .
greenpeace and the wwf also saw the abs deal as significant progress .

" this has been a major step forward , " gabriel said .
more than 30 countries had proposed a total area over land and sea of 68 million hectares - equivalent to one-and-a-half times the area of germany , he said , singling out indonesia , mexico and democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
biofuel still controversial gabriel said that while there had been no substantive agreement on the controversial issue of biofuels , a work programme on the issue had been set up for the two years leading to the nagoya conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .
significant announcements the conference also saw significant announcements from participating countries .

and environment minister jose endundo bononge said drc planned a huge new conservation area of up to 15 billion hectares - or the size of greece .
at a final plenary session continuing into friday evening , conference delegates reached consensus agreement on dozens of changes to the final text , with gabriel finding it necessary to call on some delegations to show flexibility .

" ballack electrifies everyone ... he can lead us to the title , " the bild am sonntag sunday paper said in praise of the chelsea midfielder . serbia takes lead serbia , who failed to qualify for euro 2008 , proved an awkward opponent in gelsenkirchen for germany eight days before joachim loew 's side kick off their euro 2008 campaign against poland .

germany also had a strong penalty appeal turned down after torsten frings appeared to be tripped in the box by ilic .
podolski came on at half-time for philipp lahm , moving to the left of midfield as germany pressed for an equalizer , but it was serbia who came closest when jankovic crashed the ball against the bar from close range in the 54th minute .

" ballack electrifies everyone ... he can lead us to the title , " the bild am sonntag sunday paper said in praise of the chelsea midfielder . serbia takes lead serbia , who failed to qualify for euro 2008 , proved an awkward opponent in gelsenkirchen for germany eight days before joachim loew 's side kick off their euro 2008 campaign against poland .
the home crowd were silenced in the 19th minute when an exchange of passes in midfield allowed sasa ilic to split the back four with a pass to bosko jankovic who raced clear to slide the ball between the legs of jens lehmann in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuville scores in the 74th minute , bringing much-needed relief to the german side it was the first chance of the game for serbia , with ilic 's pass exposing exactly the area of defense which had been a concern in tuesday 's 2-2 draw with belarus .

christoph metzelder , who had played only nine games for real madrid this season because of a foot injury , was given another chance to prove his fitness .
germany began strongly and serbia central defender nemanja vidic had to clear off the line from a ballack header in the 14th minute .
gomez was unfortunate not to equalize 10 minutes before the break when he failed to connect properly in front of goal from a jansen cross .
germany also had a strong penalty appeal turned down after torsten frings appeared to be tripped in the box by ilic .
podolski came on at half-time for philipp lahm , moving to the left of midfield as germany pressed for an equalizer , but it was serbia who came closest when jankovic crashed the ball against the bar from close range in the 54th minute .
arne friedrich replaced per mertesacker in central defence at half-time , and further substitutions followed , with simon rolfes coming on for torsten frings , neuville replacing kuranyi in the 70th minute , and bastian schweinsteiger later making way for odonkor .
it was neuville who finally broke the deadlock when he came off the bench in the 70th minute to score from close range four minutes later . ballack in top form after jansen was fouled on the edge of the area by branislav ivanovic , who earned a yellow card , the free-kick was touched to rolfes who teed up ballack to strike a right-foot shot into the corner of the net .

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "

as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .
the protest organizers - the latvian dairy farmers union - warned that more protests may follow .

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "
soft landing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian farmers said they 'd rather give their milk for free than at bargain prices since the eu has decided to scrap all milk quotas in 2015 , it proposes raising the quotas every year until 2014 in an effort to provide a " soft landing " for milk farmers .
as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .
the protest organizers - the latvian dairy farmers union - warned that more protests may follow .
in the 1990s , latvians stood in long lines outside grocery stores for a loaf of bread as the small baltic nation struggled for its independence from the soviet union . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in moscow , however , the city authorities denied a pro-gay group a permit to march on saturday for the third year in a row .
in the past , gay pride has prompted savage backlashes in the three countries , with marches banned by the authorities and attacked by religious extremists , ultra-nationalists and communists .
in 2005 and 2006 , pro-gay activists in riga were attacked by anti-gay demonstrators who pelted them with eggs , fruit and excrement .
in 2007 , several hundred police , including heavily-armored riot squads , formed a human barrier at the vermanes park in central riga as up to 500 gay activists staged a peaceful " march for equality " inside .
in moscow , organizers have appealed to russian president dmitry medvedev to override the city administration 's ban on the parade .
up to 100 volunteers from amnesty international 's british and scandinavian groups are set to attend events in latvia on saturday , amnesty researcher anders dahlbeck said .
concern over latvian failures latvia 's failure to protect sexual minorities " has been very concerning , and we believe our presence at the march will ensure that the latvian authorities feel obliged to protect the march , including both latvian and international participants , " he told dpa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay rights supporters bring " love " to moscow 's streets members of the danish parliament also plan to act as observers .
" i hope our being there will give the right signal to the troublemakers , " the danish social democrat flemmin moeller mortensen told a danish radio station this week .
the troublemakers are mostly church leaders and politicians that frequently accuse gay activists of being pedophiles , perverts , criminals , drug addicts and mentally ill .
" i do n't think we should allow a small percentage of society to spread their perversion " , " the latvian capital 's deputy mayor andris argalis told leta news agency on wednesday .
" otherwise , we will have to give equal rights to other groups of people with sexual deviances . "
riga 's roman catholic archbishop , janis pujats , issued a letter this week condemning the parade as " unlawful , " saying it is immoral .
the archbishop condemned homosexuality as going " against the natural order and therefore again the laws of god . "
poland 's tensions still lurking tensions in predominantly catholic poland appeared to have abated after the country 's right-wing government lost elections last year , but they did n't disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent opposition to gays is still evident in some nations pro-gay groups and amnesty international say discrimination based on sexual orientation persists .
warsaw 's gay pride march is planned for june 7 .
in the baltics , homosexuality was outlawed throughout the soviet occupation .
it was decriminalized only after independence in 1991 , but public attitudes have been slow to change .
amnesty international also weighed in on lithuania for failing to respect the rights of homosexuals .
lithuania criticized in amnesty report in its 2008 report on the state of human rights worldwide , amnesty said : " lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -lrb- lgbt -rrb- peoples ' human rights were not respected and several lgbt events were cancelled in a discriminatory manner .
-lrb- the lithuanian -rrb- parliament also discussed banning information which would put homosexuality in a positive light to minors . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international 's barbara lochbihler with the report the report also highlighted the decision of vilnius mayor juozas imbrasas to ban an eu-sponsored anti-discrimination truck from coming to the lithuanian capital and to refuse permission for a tolerance campaign rally by homosexuals last may .
it also noted that sexual minorities were refused the right to put social advertising on public transport buses based on imbrasas 's decision to give " priority to the traditional family " and his disapproval for the public display of homosexual ideas in the city .
romanian march goes ahead unhindered despite the seething undercurrent of intolerance still prevalent in eastern europe , public displays of solidarity continue against a backdrop of resentment and threats of violence .
around 200 gay activists marched through bucharest last weekend in a heavily policed pride parade that defied efforts by romanian religious and far-right groups to have the annual event banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers were injured in budapest 's pride march in 2007 romania 's fifth annual gay festival went ahead despite an attempt by anti-gay groups to get a court to rule against the march .
before the pride march took place , two counter-demonstrations were held , including one by a far-right group whose members chanted " romania does not want you " in a protest they said was " against sin . "
romania decriminalized homosexuality in 2001 , but gay people often face hostility in this largely conservative country of 22 million where the powerful orthodox church views homosexuality as a sin and a disease .
there were no reports of violence in contrast to the event in 2007 , when around 1,200 riot police faced an angry mob and detained dozens of protesters who tried to break up the march . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government made intense efforts to secure the release of the german national and managed to reach agreement with the us , " a spokesman of the ministry said .
the man was detained at the beginning of january this year in a kabul supermarket on a us base after american officials apparently found him acting suspiciously .
the man , who lives in the city of wuppertal , was visiting relatives at the time .
wrong place at the wrong time the german ambassador to afghanistan , hans-ulrich seidt , who was allowed by us authorities to visit the man in prison months after his capture , had said the ghaus had seemed disoriented .
ghaus ' release on saturday , may 31 , came after months of diplomatic efforts by the german government to get him freed .
german security officials , who investigated ghaus ' family and friends , suspect he was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time and that he at no stage posed a security risk .
the case sparked comparisons with a german of turkish origin , murat kuraz , who was held in the us military 's guantanamo bay camp on cuba for more than four years without ever being charged .

the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .
greenpeace and the wwf cast doubt on whether the goal of significantly cutting species loss by 2010 could be reached .

gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .

biofuel still controversial gabriel said that while there had been no substantive agreement on the controversial issue of biofuels , a work programme on the issue had been set up for the two years leading to the nagoya conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .
significant announcements the conference also saw significant announcements from participating countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalist activists made sure their protest was visible brazilian environment minister carlos minc announced four new protected areas , three of them in the amazon basin and stressed his commitment to zero net deforestation by 2020 .
and environment minister jose endundo bononge said drc planned a huge new conservation area of up to 15 billion hectares - or the size of greece .
at a final plenary session continuing into friday evening , conference delegates reached consensus agreement on dozens of changes to the final text , with gabriel finding it necessary to call on some delegations to show flexibility .
the conference is the ninth meeting of the 191 countries participating in the cbd , which was agreed at the 1992 rio earth summit and given added impetus at the johannesburg sustainable development summit a decade later . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "
soft landing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian farmers said they 'd rather give their milk for free than at bargain prices since the eu has decided to scrap all milk quotas in 2015 , it proposes raising the quotas every year until 2014 in an effort to provide a " soft landing " for milk farmers .
as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .
the protest organizers - the latvian dairy farmers union - warned that more protests may follow .
in the 1990s , latvians stood in long lines outside grocery stores for a loaf of bread as the small baltic nation struggled for its independence from the soviet union . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was satisfied with the outcome of the conference the un convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was " alive again and back on the international political agenda , " gabriel said . but environmental organizations greenpeace and the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- expressed scepticism .
the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .
greenpeace and the wwf cast doubt on whether the goal of significantly cutting species loss by 2010 could be reached .
but both organizations welcomed additional funding promised by germany , norway and finland .
a de facto moratorium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gene-manipulated trees were a particular concern for environmental activists gabriel said the conference had secured a " de facto moratorium " on marine fertilization , the controversial practice of seeding the seas with iron filings to promote algae blooms in the hope of absorbing carbon dioxide .
cbd officials warn research is lacking on the impact on marine ecosystems .
gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .

" ballack electrifies everyone ... he can lead us to the title , " the bild am sonntag sunday paper said in praise of the chelsea midfielder . serbia takes lead serbia , who failed to qualify for euro 2008 , proved an awkward opponent in gelsenkirchen for germany eight days before joachim loew 's side kick off their euro 2008 campaign against poland .
the home crowd were silenced in the 19th minute when an exchange of passes in midfield allowed sasa ilic to split the back four with a pass to bosko jankovic who raced clear to slide the ball between the legs of jens lehmann in goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuville scores in the 74th minute , bringing much-needed relief to the german side it was the first chance of the game for serbia , with ilic 's pass exposing exactly the area of defense which had been a concern in tuesday 's 2-2 draw with belarus .
neuville breaks deadlock loew made four changes from the team which drew 2-2 with belarus on tuesday , bringing in marcell jansen at left-back , clemens fritz on the right of midfield and kevin kuranyi and mario gomez in attack .
christoph metzelder , who had played only nine games for real madrid this season because of a foot injury , was given another chance to prove his fitness .
germany began strongly and serbia central defender nemanja vidic had to clear off the line from a ballack header in the 14th minute .
gomez was unfortunate not to equalize 10 minutes before the break when he failed to connect properly in front of goal from a jansen cross .
germany also had a strong penalty appeal turned down after torsten frings appeared to be tripped in the box by ilic .
podolski came on at half-time for philipp lahm , moving to the left of midfield as germany pressed for an equalizer , but it was serbia who came closest when jankovic crashed the ball against the bar from close range in the 54th minute .
arne friedrich replaced per mertesacker in central defence at half-time , and further substitutions followed , with simon rolfes coming on for torsten frings , neuville replacing kuranyi in the 70th minute , and bastian schweinsteiger later making way for odonkor .
it was neuville who finally broke the deadlock when he came off the bench in the 70th minute to score from close range four minutes later . ballack in top form after jansen was fouled on the edge of the area by branislav ivanovic , who earned a yellow card , the free-kick was touched to rolfes who teed up ballack to strike a right-foot shot into the corner of the net .
germany coach joachim loew heaped praise on his key player . " michael ballack permanently led the team on the attack .
he is in great shape .
he scored a deciding goal .
he had a strong presence on the field , " said loew . ballack , who is still in search of his firsdt major trophy , could make the difference for the three-time champion germany at the june 7-29 tournament in austria and switzerland . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government made intense efforts to secure the release of the german national and managed to reach agreement with the us , " a spokesman of the ministry said .

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "
soft landing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian farmers said they 'd rather give their milk for free than at bargain prices since the eu has decided to scrap all milk quotas in 2015 , it proposes raising the quotas every year until 2014 in an effort to provide a " soft landing " for milk farmers .
as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .
the protest organizers - the latvian dairy farmers union - warned that more protests may follow .
in the 1990s , latvians stood in long lines outside grocery stores for a loaf of bread as the small baltic nation struggled for its independence from the soviet union . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cbd officials warn research is lacking on the impact on marine ecosystems .
gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .
poorer countries with unique natural resources are concerned at the patenting of indigenous remedies by the pharmaceutical industry without payments to the countries where they originate .
greenpeace and the wwf also saw the abs deal as significant progress .
life web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community still has a lot to do to protect endangered species cbd officials applauded significant progress on protected areas , including the initiative put forward by host country germany to set up an internet-based " life web " to link countries offering protected areas with countries prepared to fund them .
" this has been a major step forward , " gabriel said .
more than 30 countries had proposed a total area over land and sea of 68 million hectares - equivalent to one-and-a-half times the area of germany , he said , singling out indonesia , mexico and democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
biofuel still controversial gabriel said that while there had been no substantive agreement on the controversial issue of biofuels , a work programme on the issue had been set up for the two years leading to the nagoya conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .
significant announcements the conference also saw significant announcements from participating countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalist activists made sure their protest was visible brazilian environment minister carlos minc announced four new protected areas , three of them in the amazon basin and stressed his commitment to zero net deforestation by 2020 .
and environment minister jose endundo bononge said drc planned a huge new conservation area of up to 15 billion hectares - or the size of greece .
at a final plenary session continuing into friday evening , conference delegates reached consensus agreement on dozens of changes to the final text , with gabriel finding it necessary to call on some delegations to show flexibility .
the conference is the ninth meeting of the 191 countries participating in the cbd , which was agreed at the 1992 rio earth summit and given added impetus at the johannesburg sustainable development summit a decade later . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government made intense efforts to secure the release of the german national and managed to reach agreement with the us , " a spokesman of the ministry said .
the man was detained at the beginning of january this year in a kabul supermarket on a us base after american officials apparently found him acting suspiciously .
the man , who lives in the city of wuppertal , was visiting relatives at the time .
wrong place at the wrong time the german ambassador to afghanistan , hans-ulrich seidt , who was allowed by us authorities to visit the man in prison months after his capture , had said the ghaus had seemed disoriented .
ghaus ' release on saturday , may 31 , came after months of diplomatic efforts by the german government to get him freed .
german security officials , who investigated ghaus ' family and friends , suspect he was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time and that he at no stage posed a security risk .
the case sparked comparisons with a german of turkish origin , murat kuraz , who was held in the us military 's guantanamo bay camp on cuba for more than four years without ever being charged .

about 1,000 people spilled into riga 's dome square on friday for splashes of unpasteurized milk as farmers rallied against the eu 's decision to raise milk quotas . the protest came as milk supplies tightened in germany on the fourth day of a boycott by dairy farmers , who are dumping milk rather than sell it for prices they say are too low .
latvian farmers fear that the nation 's dairy industry , which employs 60,000 people , will follow the sugar industry that collapsed after the baltic nation of 2.3 million joined the eu in 2004 .
protesting farmers demanded equal subsidies for all eu farmers and demanded that agriculture minister martins roze quit .
" they do n't know in europe where we are , and who else should care about it other than our government ? " farmer anita bordovska told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
a caricature in the diena daily on friday depicted roze as a doctor who tells a sick cow lying in bed , " the eu doctors ' council decided to amputate your udder , so you 'd feel better . "
soft landing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian farmers said they 'd rather give their milk for free than at bargain prices since the eu has decided to scrap all milk quotas in 2015 , it proposes raising the quotas every year until 2014 in an effort to provide a " soft landing " for milk farmers .
as a way to prevent dairy farmers ' unrest , latvia and lithuania asked the european commission - the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc - two weeks ago to subsidise milk exports to russia to keep farmers in business .
the ec said that would not be the right move .
writing on his blog before the protest , roze said he supports the demonstration .
later , he added he would n't resign because that " would be running away from responsibility . "
unequal partners government officials complained that the baltic nation receives the least eu farm subsidies - even less than eu newcomers romania and bulgaria .
farmers agree with the complaint , but blame the latvian government for providing outdated data on farms and farmland .
the protest organizers - the latvian dairy farmers union - warned that more protests may follow .
in the 1990s , latvians stood in long lines outside grocery stores for a loaf of bread as the small baltic nation struggled for its independence from the soviet union . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , right , with gesine schwan , the spd 's candidate for german president " there is no question of forming a government with -lrb- the left -rrb- , nor any acceptance of support from it , because this party is totally at odds with our basic convictions , " beck said .
flirting with the left the spd , a member of angela merkel 's ruling left-right coalition , is grappling with a huge popularity slump amid internal bickering over economic policy and the party 's future course .
on friday , an opinion poll showed only 21 percent of germans would vote for the party in next year 's general election , the lowest score since taking office with chancellor angela merkel 's christian union in november 2005 .

" the german government made intense efforts to secure the release of the german national and managed to reach agreement with the us , " a spokesman of the ministry said .
the man was detained at the beginning of january this year in a kabul supermarket on a us base after american officials apparently found him acting suspiciously .
the man , who lives in the city of wuppertal , was visiting relatives at the time .
wrong place at the wrong time the german ambassador to afghanistan , hans-ulrich seidt , who was allowed by us authorities to visit the man in prison months after his capture , had said the ghaus had seemed disoriented .
ghaus ' release on saturday , may 31 , came after months of diplomatic efforts by the german government to get him freed .
german security officials , who investigated ghaus ' family and friends , suspect he was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time and that he at no stage posed a security risk .
the case sparked comparisons with a german of turkish origin , murat kuraz , who was held in the us military 's guantanamo bay camp on cuba for more than four years without ever being charged .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was satisfied with the outcome of the conference the un convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was " alive again and back on the international political agenda , " gabriel said . but environmental organizations greenpeace and the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- expressed scepticism .
the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .
greenpeace and the wwf cast doubt on whether the goal of significantly cutting species loss by 2010 could be reached .
but both organizations welcomed additional funding promised by germany , norway and finland .
a de facto moratorium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gene-manipulated trees were a particular concern for environmental activists gabriel said the conference had secured a " de facto moratorium " on marine fertilization , the controversial practice of seeding the seas with iron filings to promote algae blooms in the hope of absorbing carbon dioxide .
cbd officials warn research is lacking on the impact on marine ecosystems .
gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .
poorer countries with unique natural resources are concerned at the patenting of indigenous remedies by the pharmaceutical industry without payments to the countries where they originate .
greenpeace and the wwf also saw the abs deal as significant progress .
life web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community still has a lot to do to protect endangered species cbd officials applauded significant progress on protected areas , including the initiative put forward by host country germany to set up an internet-based " life web " to link countries offering protected areas with countries prepared to fund them .
" this has been a major step forward , " gabriel said .
more than 30 countries had proposed a total area over land and sea of 68 million hectares - equivalent to one-and-a-half times the area of germany , he said , singling out indonesia , mexico and democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
biofuel still controversial gabriel said that while there had been no substantive agreement on the controversial issue of biofuels , a work programme on the issue had been set up for the two years leading to the nagoya conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .
significant announcements the conference also saw significant announcements from participating countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalist activists made sure their protest was visible brazilian environment minister carlos minc announced four new protected areas , three of them in the amazon basin and stressed his commitment to zero net deforestation by 2020 .
and environment minister jose endundo bononge said drc planned a huge new conservation area of up to 15 billion hectares - or the size of greece .
at a final plenary session continuing into friday evening , conference delegates reached consensus agreement on dozens of changes to the final text , with gabriel finding it necessary to call on some delegations to show flexibility .
the conference is the ninth meeting of the 191 countries participating in the cbd , which was agreed at the 1992 rio earth summit and given added impetus at the johannesburg sustainable development summit a decade later . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in moscow , however , the city authorities denied a pro-gay group a permit to march on saturday for the third year in a row .
in the past , gay pride has prompted savage backlashes in the three countries , with marches banned by the authorities and attacked by religious extremists , ultra-nationalists and communists .
in 2005 and 2006 , pro-gay activists in riga were attacked by anti-gay demonstrators who pelted them with eggs , fruit and excrement .
in 2007 , several hundred police , including heavily-armored riot squads , formed a human barrier at the vermanes park in central riga as up to 500 gay activists staged a peaceful " march for equality " inside .
in moscow , organizers have appealed to russian president dmitry medvedev to override the city administration 's ban on the parade .
up to 100 volunteers from amnesty international 's british and scandinavian groups are set to attend events in latvia on saturday , amnesty researcher anders dahlbeck said .
concern over latvian failures latvia 's failure to protect sexual minorities " has been very concerning , and we believe our presence at the march will ensure that the latvian authorities feel obliged to protect the march , including both latvian and international participants , " he told dpa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay rights supporters bring " love " to moscow 's streets members of the danish parliament also plan to act as observers .
" i hope our being there will give the right signal to the troublemakers , " the danish social democrat flemmin moeller mortensen told a danish radio station this week .
the troublemakers are mostly church leaders and politicians that frequently accuse gay activists of being pedophiles , perverts , criminals , drug addicts and mentally ill .
" i do n't think we should allow a small percentage of society to spread their perversion " , " the latvian capital 's deputy mayor andris argalis told leta news agency on wednesday .
" otherwise , we will have to give equal rights to other groups of people with sexual deviances . "
riga 's roman catholic archbishop , janis pujats , issued a letter this week condemning the parade as " unlawful , " saying it is immoral .
the archbishop condemned homosexuality as going " against the natural order and therefore again the laws of god . "
poland 's tensions still lurking tensions in predominantly catholic poland appeared to have abated after the country 's right-wing government lost elections last year , but they did n't disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent opposition to gays is still evident in some nations pro-gay groups and amnesty international say discrimination based on sexual orientation persists .
warsaw 's gay pride march is planned for june 7 .
in the baltics , homosexuality was outlawed throughout the soviet occupation .
it was decriminalized only after independence in 1991 , but public attitudes have been slow to change .
amnesty international also weighed in on lithuania for failing to respect the rights of homosexuals .
lithuania criticized in amnesty report in its 2008 report on the state of human rights worldwide , amnesty said : " lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -lrb- lgbt -rrb- peoples ' human rights were not respected and several lgbt events were cancelled in a discriminatory manner .
-lrb- the lithuanian -rrb- parliament also discussed banning information which would put homosexuality in a positive light to minors . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international 's barbara lochbihler with the report the report also highlighted the decision of vilnius mayor juozas imbrasas to ban an eu-sponsored anti-discrimination truck from coming to the lithuanian capital and to refuse permission for a tolerance campaign rally by homosexuals last may .
it also noted that sexual minorities were refused the right to put social advertising on public transport buses based on imbrasas 's decision to give " priority to the traditional family " and his disapproval for the public display of homosexual ideas in the city .
romanian march goes ahead unhindered despite the seething undercurrent of intolerance still prevalent in eastern europe , public displays of solidarity continue against a backdrop of resentment and threats of violence .
around 200 gay activists marched through bucharest last weekend in a heavily policed pride parade that defied efforts by romanian religious and far-right groups to have the annual event banned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers were injured in budapest 's pride march in 2007 romania 's fifth annual gay festival went ahead despite an attempt by anti-gay groups to get a court to rule against the march .
before the pride march took place , two counter-demonstrations were held , including one by a far-right group whose members chanted " romania does not want you " in a protest they said was " against sin . "
romania decriminalized homosexuality in 2001 , but gay people often face hostility in this largely conservative country of 22 million where the powerful orthodox church views homosexuality as a sin and a disease .
there were no reports of violence in contrast to the event in 2007 , when around 1,200 riot police faced an angry mob and detained dozens of protesters who tried to break up the march . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel was satisfied with the outcome of the conference the un convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was " alive again and back on the international political agenda , " gabriel said . but environmental organizations greenpeace and the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- expressed scepticism .
the conference had " confirmed the indifference of the international community when it comes to protecting forests , protecting the climate and conserving biodiversity , " greenpeace said .
proceedings had " inched forward like a snail " in the face of rapid species loss , it said .
greenpeace and the wwf cast doubt on whether the goal of significantly cutting species loss by 2010 could be reached .
but both organizations welcomed additional funding promised by germany , norway and finland .
a de facto moratorium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gene-manipulated trees were a particular concern for environmental activists gabriel said the conference had secured a " de facto moratorium " on marine fertilization , the controversial practice of seeding the seas with iron filings to promote algae blooms in the hope of absorbing carbon dioxide .
cbd officials warn research is lacking on the impact on marine ecosystems .
gabriel highlighted the agreement struck on access and benefit sharing -lrb- abs -rrb- from nature 's resources , as the 12-day conference 's main achievement .
the abs deal - known as the bonn mandate - has laid down a specific agenda to be discussed ahead of an agreement to halt " biopiracy " expected to be reached at the next cbd conference in the japanese city of nagoya in 2010 .
poorer countries with unique natural resources are concerned at the patenting of indigenous remedies by the pharmaceutical industry without payments to the countries where they originate .
greenpeace and the wwf also saw the abs deal as significant progress .
life web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community still has a lot to do to protect endangered species cbd officials applauded significant progress on protected areas , including the initiative put forward by host country germany to set up an internet-based " life web " to link countries offering protected areas with countries prepared to fund them .
" this has been a major step forward , " gabriel said .
more than 30 countries had proposed a total area over land and sea of 68 million hectares - equivalent to one-and-a-half times the area of germany , he said , singling out indonesia , mexico and democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
biofuel still controversial gabriel said that while there had been no substantive agreement on the controversial issue of biofuels , a work programme on the issue had been set up for the two years leading to the nagoya conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel is still a contentious issue greenpeace said no progress had been made here , with brazil " resisting binding rules to prevent the destruction of tropical forests that occurs to make way for biofuel plantations . "
the differences between major biofuel producers , like brazil , and major oil producers was made clear , with libya and qatar highlighting the rise in world food prices , which they attributed , at least in part , to using land for biofuel production .
gabriel made a special point of thanking arab oil producers for their " extreme flexibility . "
environmental groups were particularly critical of the lack of agreement on banning the trade in illegally logged timber , even though gabriel claimed there had been progress in the shape of a call to countries for greater action .
on the planting of genetically modified trees , gabriel said there was agreement that there had to be a " thorough risk analysis " before they were used .
significant announcements the conference also saw significant announcements from participating countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalist activists made sure their protest was visible brazilian environment minister carlos minc announced four new protected areas , three of them in the amazon basin and stressed his commitment to zero net deforestation by 2020 .
and environment minister jose endundo bononge said drc planned a huge new conservation area of up to 15 billion hectares - or the size of greece .
at a final plenary session continuing into friday evening , conference delegates reached consensus agreement on dozens of changes to the final text , with gabriel finding it necessary to call on some delegations to show flexibility .
the conference is the ninth meeting of the 191 countries participating in the cbd , which was agreed at the 1992 rio earth summit and given added impetus at the johannesburg sustainable development summit a decade later . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

peter robinson has been , with one brief interruption , ian paisley 's deputy for 28 years .
asked how he had coped with waiting so long for the party leadership , he quipped : " i am a patient man " .
an estate agent by profession , peter robinson married iris collins in 1970 - the partnership later took on political as well as personal significance , when the two became a husband and wife team at westminster .
in 1971 , he was one of the founder members of the dup .
the death of a school friend , harry beggs , killed that year in an ira bombing at northern ireland electricity headquarters , spurred the young mr robinson to enter politics .
he won the east belfast parliamentary seat in 1979 , turning over an ulster unionist majority of 17,000 .
he became dup deputy leader a year later .
as deputy , he built a reputation as a canny strategist , plotting the dup 's election campaigns .
alongside the protest politics , the east belfast mp remained ready to chart a way forward in the mid 1980s , he played a leading role in the joint unionist campaign against the anglo irish agreement .
this led to the most controversial episodes in his career when he led 500 loyalists in an " incursion " into the monaghan village of clontibret .
he later plead guilty to unlawful assembly .
later that year , he was photographed wearing a beret at a rally of the paramilitary ulster resistance movement .
but alongside the protest politics , the east belfast mp remained ready to chart a way forward .
he drew up a " unionist task force " report together with ulster unionists harold mccusker and frank millar .
mr robinson was ian paisley 's deputy for 28 years in 1988 , he participated in a meeting in the german city of duisburg with other local parties at a stage when the formal political process remained frozen .
together with the rest of the dup , peter robinson opposed the 1998 good friday agreement , honing in on aspects like the release of paramilitary prisoners .
but he took office as minister for regional development , refusing to attend stormont executive meetings , but impressing his civil servants with his grasp of the detail of his brief .
he claimed credit , amongst other things , for introducing free travel for the elderly .
when the dup became the main unionist party , peter robinson emerged as one of the party 's most influential negotiators in the talks that led to the 2006 st andrews agreement .
he worked hard to limit the ability of ministers in a future executive to act as " independent warlords " .
after the restoration of devolution in may 2007 , he took the finance ministry and helped make revitalising the local economy the main theme of the new stormont executive 's programme for government .
in his first budget , mr robinson froze the stormont regional rate - a reminder that , as a stalwart of castlereagh council , he had long been a champion of keeping rates low and paring back on council expenditure .
peter robinson 's supporters view him as an effective manager - the kind of politician who will be able to cut down on waste in the public sector and boost the fortunes of local entrepreneurs .
the challenges facing the future first minister include when to complete devolution , by agreeing the transfer of policing and justice powers his critics accuse him of being a " control freak " .
he certainly is a politician you cross at your peril - when the sdlp minister margaret ritchie tried to cut funding to a uda linked conflict transformation initiative she found herself on the receiving end of a withering attack from the finance minister who believed she had exceeded her legal powers .
away from politics , peter robinson relaxes by breeding japanese koi carp .
he collects an array of ties , and enjoys golf and bowling .
he and his wife , iris , who became strangford mp in 2001 , have three children .
the challenges facing the future first minister include when to complete devolution , by agreeing the transfer of policing and justice powers .
given the disquiet amongst some dup grassroots supporters over the " chuckle brothers " relationship between ian paisley and martin mcguinness , peter robinson is expected to adopt a more detached relationship with the deputy first minister .
at the same time , he will want to convince voters and potential investors that the stormont executive can deliver good government .
so expect a cooler style , but not necessarily any breakdown in communications .

in 1971 , he was one of the founder members of the dup .
the death of a school friend , harry beggs , killed that year in an ira bombing at northern ireland electricity headquarters , spurred the young mr robinson to enter politics .

mr robinson was ian paisley 's deputy for 28 years in 1988 , he participated in a meeting in the german city of duisburg with other local parties at a stage when the formal political process remained frozen .
together with the rest of the dup , peter robinson opposed the 1998 good friday agreement , honing in on aspects like the release of paramilitary prisoners .

the royal shakespeare company -lrb- rsc -rrb- - where she spent a year before her comedy career - invited her to speak to a younger audience at the hay festival .
but tate admitted at the powys literary festival that she struggled to enjoy the bard 's comedies at times .
" it 's got to strike a chord with us .
we ca n't write shakespeare off but wearing bells on knees is n't going to work . "
but she said she had impersonated sir ian mckellen in the way he delivered a shakespearean scene on stage , which helped her finally pass her drama school audition at 21 after a few attempts .
tate was speaking as part of the rsc 's shakespeare and me series , as doctor who star david tennant is preparing to play the lead in hamlet for the company from next month .
about her tv sketch show characters , tate said she doubted she would bring back teenager lauren , who was supposedly killed off in a christmas special - " although they still have n't found a body . "
she said lauren , with the " am i bovvered ? " catchphrase , only came about because she liked to try out and improvise her characters in front of a live audience first - and she got a reaction .
" i do n't sit in front of a computer to write , " she said of her bbc award-winning catherine tate show .
" i tried her -lrb- lauren -rrb- out at the latchmere theatre in london with about seven people in the audience .
when i said ' am i bovvered ? ' about three of the seven tittered , and i repeated it and by the end they were all cackling and i realised they 'd picked up on it . "
she said she was proud to have lauren perform a shakespearean sonnet in a sketch for comic relief .
" she used to get so much stick , she was getting the blame for the hoodie culture .
i never thought for a moment that children would pick up on it .
" but i did n't want her to be a bad child , i made sure she never swore but i wanted her to be bright if a little bit bolshie . "
tate said her cantankerous nan character was about the " privilege of old age , you can get away with so much - it 's really funny when old people swear . "
" that was the most fun , it was a kind of an amalgamation of a lot of old ladies - but not my own nan , although they way she sits was based on my godmother !
" she always had her handbag by her side and would n't let you leave the room without giving you money .
she 'd hook the bag with her walking stick and take out a fiver ! "
on whether she would produce another series she said : " if i have more ideas i will ... we need to have some new ideas , then hopefully yes . "

the royal shakespeare company -lrb- rsc -rrb- - where she spent a year before her comedy career - invited her to speak to a younger audience at the hay festival .
but tate admitted at the powys literary festival that she struggled to enjoy the bard 's comedies at times .
" it 's got to strike a chord with us .
we ca n't write shakespeare off but wearing bells on knees is n't going to work . "
but she said she had impersonated sir ian mckellen in the way he delivered a shakespearean scene on stage , which helped her finally pass her drama school audition at 21 after a few attempts .
tate was speaking as part of the rsc 's shakespeare and me series , as doctor who star david tennant is preparing to play the lead in hamlet for the company from next month .
about her tv sketch show characters , tate said she doubted she would bring back teenager lauren , who was supposedly killed off in a christmas special - " although they still have n't found a body . "
she said lauren , with the " am i bovvered ? " catchphrase , only came about because she liked to try out and improvise her characters in front of a live audience first - and she got a reaction .
tate 's nan character is known for her foul language " i do n't sit in front of a computer to write , " she said of her bbc award-winning catherine tate show .
" i tried her -lrb- lauren -rrb- out at the latchmere theatre in london with about seven people in the audience .
when i said ' am i bovvered ? ' about three of the seven tittered , and i repeated it and by the end they were all cackling and i realised they 'd picked up on it . "
she said she was proud to have lauren perform a shakespearean sonnet in a sketch for comic relief .
" she used to get so much stick , she was getting the blame for the hoodie culture .
i never thought for a moment that children would pick up on it .
" but i did n't want her to be a bad child , i made sure she never swore but i wanted her to be bright if a little bit bolshie . "
tate said her cantankerous nan character was about the " privilege of old age , you can get away with so much - it 's really funny when old people swear . "
" that was the most fun , it was a kind of an amalgamation of a lot of old ladies - but not my own nan , although they way she sits was based on my godmother !
" she always had her handbag by her side and would n't let you leave the room without giving you money .
she 'd hook the bag with her walking stick and take out a fiver ! "
on whether she would produce another series she said : " if i have more ideas i will ... we need to have some new ideas , then hopefully yes . "

she said lauren , with the " am i bovvered ? " catchphrase , only came about because she liked to try out and improvise her characters in front of a live audience first - and she got a reaction .
tate 's nan character is known for her foul language " i do n't sit in front of a computer to write , " she said of her bbc award-winning catherine tate show .
" i tried her -lrb- lauren -rrb- out at the latchmere theatre in london with about seven people in the audience .
when i said ' am i bovvered ? ' about three of the seven tittered , and i repeated it and by the end they were all cackling and i realised they 'd picked up on it . "
she said she was proud to have lauren perform a shakespearean sonnet in a sketch for comic relief .
" she used to get so much stick , she was getting the blame for the hoodie culture .
i never thought for a moment that children would pick up on it .
" but i did n't want her to be a bad child , i made sure she never swore but i wanted her to be bright if a little bit bolshie . "
tate said her cantankerous nan character was about the " privilege of old age , you can get away with so much - it 's really funny when old people swear . "
" that was the most fun , it was a kind of an amalgamation of a lot of old ladies - but not my own nan , although they way she sits was based on my godmother !
" she always had her handbag by her side and would n't let you leave the room without giving you money .
she 'd hook the bag with her walking stick and take out a fiver ! "
on whether she would produce another series she said : " if i have more ideas i will ... we need to have some new ideas , then hopefully yes . "
