with germany celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the introduction of its social-market economy and the d-mark this june , merkel was also at pains to emphasize that these events did not undermine the legitimacy of the existing order .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the ft .
" but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .
my patriotic sensitivity tells me i must stand by these companies in tough times .
we must lead them onto the path of virtue , no question , but one should not condemn them en masse . "
one allegation after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender of the business faith : angela merkel just under two weeks ago , deutsche telekom ceo called in prosecutors to investigate allegations that the company had engaged a data-mining firm to track thousands of calls between top executives and journalists .
snooping accusations have subsequently been levelled in the media against a number of other firms , such as lufthansa and deutsche bahn .
this comes after investigations into bribery at siemens and corruption at volkswagen .
several former bosses at europe 's biggest carmaker have been prosecuted after it emerged in 2005 that a slush fund was set up to pay for holidays and prostitutes .
these scandals and allegations of tax evasion by germany 's high earners earlier this year have stirred up widespread resentment towards the country 's business elite . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu and irish leaders are holding their collective breath as they hope to avoid disaster . with a traditional eve-of-vote news blackout in operation in ireland on wednesday , the country 's three leading political parties , who have pushed hard for a yes vote , were cautious ahead of the referendum .
as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .
he added that europe would go back to an uncertain situation if the lisbon treaty was defeated .
cowen emphasized that all of ireland 's concerns had been catered to in the treaty , rte reported .
he said it was his deeply held belief that the lisbon treaty was crucial to ireland 's future prospects .
he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .
" the most recent numbers are fairly positive , " stubb said .

as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .
he added that europe would go back to an uncertain situation if the lisbon treaty was defeated .
cowen emphasized that all of ireland 's concerns had been catered to in the treaty , rte reported .
he said it was his deeply held belief that the lisbon treaty was crucial to ireland 's future prospects .
he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .
" the most recent numbers are fairly positive , " stubb said .
the irish referendum topped the agenda of the talks , which also centered on the situation in the middle east , relations with moscow and baltic sea issues . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .
" the most recent numbers are fairly positive , " stubb said .
the irish referendum topped the agenda of the talks , which also centered on the situation in the middle east , relations with moscow and baltic sea issues . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in an interview published in british daily newspaper the times , bush said his stance over iraq had made the world believe that he was a " guy really anxious for war . "
his use of phrases such as " bring them on " and " dead or alive " had indicated to people that " i was , you know , not a man of peace , " bush said .
" i could have used a different tone " " look , i think that in retrospect , you know , i could have used a different tone , " he told the times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is " painful " to put soldiers in harms way , bush says but the truth was that he found it " very painful to put youngsters in harm 's way " and that he had an obligation to make sure that those lives were not lost in vain , he said .
bush has been widely accused of pressing for military intervention in iraq from shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks , despite little or no evidence of a link with the " 9/11 " hijackers .
the us leader insisted that he had pressed hard for a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
bush calls diplomacy efforts an " untold story " " one of the untold stories of iraq is that we explored diplomacy a lot , " he said .
" we all wanted to solve this ' disclose , disarm , or face serious consequences ' in a diplomatic fashion .
after all , i went to the united nations security council , " he added .

bush predicts strategic accord with iraq meanwhile , in a question and answer session following a final state visit to german chancellor angela merkel , bush predicted washington and baghdad would work through rifts and reach a deal on the continued deployment of us forces in iraq .
" i think we 'll end up with a strategic agreement with iraq .
there 's all kinds of noise in their system and our system , " he said .

but the croats have lots of players who ply their trade in the bundesliga .
and a decade ago , the croatian national team proved it could -lrb- man- -rrb- handle the germans . when the members of those two national squads take the pitch on thursday , june 12 in klagenfurt , those with keen memories might be thinking about the past .
in the latter half of the 1990s , the two sides became minor rivals after meeting twice in the space of two years in the quarter-finals of international tournaments .
one person who remembers those encounters very well is germany 's team manager oliver bierhoff , who played on both of those german teams .
it 's hardly surprising then that bierhoff has drawn parallels between the current squad and the one that beat the croats 2-1 in euro 1996 in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff wants germany to think of 1996 " we work very precisely - that 's one of the similarities - but in 1996 we had a lot of experienced players who had won major titles with their clubs and country , " the former striker told the online edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" the current team is a bit more hungry for and curious about what it 's like to win than was the case in 1996 , " bierhoff said .
that game was the first time germany had played post-yugoslavian croatia in a match that counted .
germany went on to win euro 96 , their last major title , thanks to a golden goal by bierhoff .
french fiasco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suker and croatia punished lothar matthaeus and germany in 1998 but two years later , at the 1998 world cup in france , the croats got revenge - and how .
after defender christian woerns was sent off in first half , croatia made a meal of their opponents , winning 3-0 .
the man of the match was croatian striker davor suker , who scored one goal and provoked the foul that left the germans shorthanded .
it was germany 's worst world cup defeat in 44 years and cost coach berti vogts , who had masterminded the 1996 euro win , his job .
" i thought it would be a one-goal game , " vogts said immediately after the debacle .
croatia lost to eventual winners france in the semis and came in third - that 's still the best-ever result for the team , which has only existed in its current form since 1990 .
intimate acquaintances bildunterschrift : croatia 's niko kovac , l , played 15 years in the bundesliga whether the players on thursday know their history is one thing .
what 's beyond doubt is that they know each other .
seven members of the croatian squad play or have played extensively in the german bundesliga .
five of them started in croatia 's lackluster 1-0 opening win against austria .
so how do they reckon their chances ?
" if we play like we did the second half -lrb- against austria -rrb- , we 'll have huge problems versus germany , " defender josip simunic , who plays for hertha berlin , cautioned after that first match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and his brother robert also knows germany inside and out but midfielder niko kovac , who did long stints at hertha , leverkusen and hamburg , has been more optimistic .
" against austria , we had enormous psychological pressure , which paralyzed us for a while , " kovac said .
" we had to win .
now we can and will play much more freely . "
but the pressure wo n't be as extreme on thursday as in either match from the 1990s .
while a win would send either croatia or germany through to the quarterfinals , both teams would stay alive in the group stage , even if they lose . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the croats have lots of players who ply their trade in the bundesliga .
and a decade ago , the croatian national team proved it could -lrb- man- -rrb- handle the germans . when the members of those two national squads take the pitch on thursday , june 12 in klagenfurt , those with keen memories might be thinking about the past .
in the latter half of the 1990s , the two sides became minor rivals after meeting twice in the space of two years in the quarter-finals of international tournaments .
one person who remembers those encounters very well is germany 's team manager oliver bierhoff , who played on both of those german teams .
it 's hardly surprising then that bierhoff has drawn parallels between the current squad and the one that beat the croats 2-1 in euro 1996 in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff wants germany to think of 1996 " we work very precisely - that 's one of the similarities - but in 1996 we had a lot of experienced players who had won major titles with their clubs and country , " the former striker told the online edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" the current team is a bit more hungry for and curious about what it 's like to win than was the case in 1996 , " bierhoff said .
that game was the first time germany had played post-yugoslavian croatia in a match that counted .
germany went on to win euro 96 , their last major title , thanks to a golden goal by bierhoff .
french fiasco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suker and croatia punished lothar matthaeus and germany in 1998 but two years later , at the 1998 world cup in france , the croats got revenge - and how .
after defender christian woerns was sent off in first half , croatia made a meal of their opponents , winning 3-0 .
the man of the match was croatian striker davor suker , who scored one goal and provoked the foul that left the germans shorthanded .
it was germany 's worst world cup defeat in 44 years and cost coach berti vogts , who had masterminded the 1996 euro win , his job .
" i thought it would be a one-goal game , " vogts said immediately after the debacle .
croatia lost to eventual winners france in the semis and came in third - that 's still the best-ever result for the team , which has only existed in its current form since 1990 .
intimate acquaintances bildunterschrift : croatia 's niko kovac , l , played 15 years in the bundesliga whether the players on thursday know their history is one thing .
what 's beyond doubt is that they know each other .
seven members of the croatian squad play or have played extensively in the german bundesliga .
five of them started in croatia 's lackluster 1-0 opening win against austria .
so how do they reckon their chances ?
" if we play like we did the second half -lrb- against austria -rrb- , we 'll have huge problems versus germany , " defender josip simunic , who plays for hertha berlin , cautioned after that first match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and his brother robert also knows germany inside and out but midfielder niko kovac , who did long stints at hertha , leverkusen and hamburg , has been more optimistic .
" against austria , we had enormous psychological pressure , which paralyzed us for a while , " kovac said .
" we had to win .
now we can and will play much more freely . "

" all options are on the table , " bush warned at a press conference after meeting merkel north of berlin at the end of his last visit to germany before leaving office .
the us preferred a diplomatic solution by working with its partners , bush said .
the five permanent members of the un security council and germany are engaged in efforts to persuade tehran to change course .
there was " a better way forward than isolation " for iran , he said , but he cautioned there could be additional un sanctions on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressuring iran leader ahmadinejad is on bush 's agenda merkel stressed germany 's preference for a diplomatic solution to the impasse , but she warned further sanctions could be applied .
merkel wants better implementation of sanctions " i believe diplomatic pressure has already taken effect , " she said .
merkel called for sanctions already passed by the security council to be better implemented , saying that she preferred the un route as this included russia and china , making sanctions more effective .
this did not exclude further action from the european union , particularly in the banking sector , merkel said .
the two leaders agreed on the need to push forward with the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks , noting that agricultural prices were becoming a crucial issue for developing countries .
bush spoke out against trade protectionism , and merkel highlighted the need for a transatlantic economic partnership - a theme she pressed under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- last year .
cooperation was particularly needed in setting standards for biofuels , merkel said in response to concerns that growing crops for conversion to fuels is resulting in higher food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is pushing for more german military in afghanistan on climate change , bush again stressed the need for the major carbon dioxide emitters among developing countries to be included in efforts to halt global warming .
merkel agreed that countries like india and china needed to be included in climate talks , saying that the german initiative in this regard at last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm would be continued in japan next month .
" we need a global agreement under the united nations , " she said .
bush regrets tone in iraq the two leaders also discussed afghanistan , with bush noting progress in healthcare , education and the economy in what he referred to as a " young democracy " emerging from years of tyranny .
bush was asked whether he regretted the iraq war , in the light of an interview with the times of london , published wednesday , june 11 , that indicated he regretted his rhetoric during the war .
" no i do n't regret it all .
but i could have used better rhetoric , " bush said .
" the decision to remove saddam hussein was the right decision . "
german press negative on visit german commentators noted that the bush visit was remarkable for the complete lack of public protest .
german political and press comment on the 20-hour visit - bush arrived from an eu-us summit in slovenia tuesday evening - was overwhelmingly negative .
" i wo n't miss george w. bush , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's conservative parliamentary bloc , told berlin regional public radio .
ulrich klose , a spokesman for germany 's other main party , the social democrats , the junior partner in merkel 's broad coalition , criticized bush 's foreign policy as " confrontational , " saying this had damaged the standing of the us in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel returned hospitality extended in crawford , texas even merkel , who has maintained friendly personal relations with the president throughout , looked ahead to the post-bush era that begins in january .

a new period will then begin , " she said .
bush arrived on his farewell visit to germany tuesday from the eu-us summit in brdo , slovenia to spend the night at schloss meseberg , the baroque palace north of the capital that the german government uses as a guesthouse .

" all options are on the table , " bush warned at a press conference after meeting merkel north of berlin at the end of his last visit to germany before leaving office .
the us preferred a diplomatic solution by working with its partners , bush said .
the five permanent members of the un security council and germany are engaged in efforts to persuade tehran to change course .
there was " a better way forward than isolation " for iran , he said , but he cautioned there could be additional un sanctions on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressuring iran leader ahmadinejad is on bush 's agenda merkel stressed germany 's preference for a diplomatic solution to the impasse , but she warned further sanctions could be applied .
merkel wants better implementation of sanctions " i believe diplomatic pressure has already taken effect , " she said .
merkel called for sanctions already passed by the security council to be better implemented , saying that she preferred the un route as this included russia and china , making sanctions more effective .
this did not exclude further action from the european union , particularly in the banking sector , merkel said .
the two leaders agreed on the need to push forward with the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks , noting that agricultural prices were becoming a crucial issue for developing countries .
bush spoke out against trade protectionism , and merkel highlighted the need for a transatlantic economic partnership - a theme she pressed under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- last year .
cooperation was particularly needed in setting standards for biofuels , merkel said in response to concerns that growing crops for conversion to fuels is resulting in higher food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is pushing for more german military in afghanistan on climate change , bush again stressed the need for the major carbon dioxide emitters among developing countries to be included in efforts to halt global warming .
merkel agreed that countries like india and china needed to be included in climate talks , saying that the german initiative in this regard at last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm would be continued in japan next month .
" we need a global agreement under the united nations , " she said .
bush regrets tone in iraq the two leaders also discussed afghanistan , with bush noting progress in healthcare , education and the economy in what he referred to as a " young democracy " emerging from years of tyranny .
bush was asked whether he regretted the iraq war , in the light of an interview with the times of london , published wednesday , june 11 , that indicated he regretted his rhetoric during the war .
" no i do n't regret it all .
but i could have used better rhetoric , " bush said .
" the decision to remove saddam hussein was the right decision . "
german press negative on visit german commentators noted that the bush visit was remarkable for the complete lack of public protest .
german political and press comment on the 20-hour visit - bush arrived from an eu-us summit in slovenia tuesday evening - was overwhelmingly negative .
" i wo n't miss george w. bush , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's conservative parliamentary bloc , told berlin regional public radio .
ulrich klose , a spokesman for germany 's other main party , the social democrats , the junior partner in merkel 's broad coalition , criticized bush 's foreign policy as " confrontational , " saying this had damaged the standing of the us in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel returned hospitality extended in crawford , texas even merkel , who has maintained friendly personal relations with the president throughout , looked ahead to the post-bush era that begins in january .
merkel looks to new chapter " this is his last european trip .
a new period will then begin , " she said .
bush arrived on his farewell visit to germany tuesday from the eu-us summit in brdo , slovenia to spend the night at schloss meseberg , the baroque palace north of the capital that the german government uses as a guesthouse .
from berlin , the president flew to rome , where apart from prime minister silvio berlusconi , he was to meet pope benedict xvi .

but the german car industry has welcomed an alternative german-franco deal as " an acceptable compromise . " the compromise , which trades carbon dioxide emissions efficiency for the use of green technologies , was reached on monday , june 9 , and received a cautiously positive reception from the bloc .
" we welcome the convergence of views between members which have big car industries but it 's a discussion that takes place within the council , with all members , " said european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj .
on december 19 , the commission proposed rules limiting the average co2 emissions of all new cars in europe to 130 grams per kilometer driven by the year 2012 - the 2006 european average was 160 grams per kilometer .
that drew criticism from german chancellor angela merkel and german carmakers .
but in consultations with french president nicolas sarkozy , a compromise was put forth whereby auto manufacturers could receive 8 kilograms per kilometer in " green credits " for using environmentally friendly technologies such as solar power .
carmakers mollified bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy saw eye to eye on the alternative co2 proposal the german-french proposal represented " a clear improvement on a proposition by the european commission , " matthias wissmann , head of the german automobile association vda , told dpa news agency .
bdi confederation of german industry spokesman werner schnappauf called the deal an " acceptable compromise , " paying tribute to merkel for " forcefully representing " the german car industry .
" not everything is clear , " added ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a german car specialist .
" but the solution is softer .
the targets will be easier to reach . "
the german car industry is fearful that tough emission targets could disproportionately penalize luxury cars manufacturers like daimler , bmw and audi with their relatively high fuel consumption and emissions and favor french and italian makers of economy cars .
merkel insists the limit should apply across the range for each carmaker , leaving carmakers the possibility of continuing to introduce high-emission luxury models , so long as they compensate by making low-emission models .
environmentalists angered but germany 's environmentalist party , the greens , were predictably less than happy about the commission 's original proposal potentially being watered down .
german media quoted green parliamentary co-leader renate kuenast as saying that merkel had " once again signed off on all of the german auto manufacturers ' propositions . "
the franco-german agreement " meant nothing good for climate protection , " she added .

but the german car industry has welcomed an alternative german-franco deal as " an acceptable compromise .

" we welcome the convergence of views between members which have big car industries but it 's a discussion that takes place within the council , with all members , " said european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj .
on december 19 , the commission proposed rules limiting the average co2 emissions of all new cars in europe to 130 grams per kilometer driven by the year 2012 - the 2006 european average was 160 grams per kilometer .

the fare program includes advertizing spot broadcasts at every euro 2008 game , pitch-side boards , and activities to encourage intercultural exchanges between fans .
but after the weekend 's violence , it remains to be seen whether these measures are enough to tackle a problem that world soccer is finding hard to shake off .
the aims of the fare campaign stand in stark contrast to the realities presented on sunday in which a minority of fans were heard shouting nazi slogans at polish supporters .
uefa rhetoric on the outbreak suggested the soccer body had accepted that violence is always a possibility at high-stakes soccer matches .
" sensitive matches are dotted around the map of austria and switzerland , you can turn anything into a sensitive match if you think twice about it , " a uefa spokesperson told news agency skysports .
" we are not particularly worried about a single episode .
we have a global concept we apply , match by match and city by city .
it is well rehearsed and we hope also for every match it will work . "
danny lynch , spokesperson for anti-racism organization kick it out , which is involved in the fare euro 2008 campaign , said there would always be a minority who use soccer as a vehicle for disruption .
" the events on sunday were carried out by people who have no interest in -lrb- harmonious and respectful ways -rrb- whatsoever .
these far-right groups with links to nazi organizations … thrive on disorder and disruption . "
switzerland prepares for the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and austrian police march off violent fans in klagenfurt in switzerland , attempts to pre-empt violence included written letters to 300 known soccer thugs around europe , warning them that violence at euro 2008 would not be tolerated .
the swiss authorities also converted part of geneva 's palexpo convention center into a temporary detainment hall for soccer thugs and allocated $ 61 million for security at the tournament uefa also shelled out money to battle discrimination at euro 2008 , with over 300,000 euros going toward the fare unite against racism campaign .
despite the vast sums spent on match security and anti-discrimination campaigns , ongoing incidents of soccer violence persist across europe at both domestic and international levels of the game .
" in the uk we 've seen a decrease generally in soccer violence , but at the same time you look at the uefa cup final when glasgow supporters were fighting with police , " said lynch .
" in italy fans are fighting amongst each other .
there are still fans that just go out to fight . "
the problem continues bildunterschrift : german hooligans continue from where they left off in 2006 although kick it out holds hopes that one day soccer can be violence-and-racism-free , danny lynch admits that such problems will likely exist in one form or another for some time to come .
" soccer is unique in many ways , but for 90 minutes there are 30,000 people sat around a field in a situation that they ordinarily would n't be in .
this is the excuse that these people use to have a fight , " he said .
" if you look at the english game 20 years ago , fighting on the terraces was a common event .
now , we do n't see that .
what we do see is a new style of racist abuse : anti-semitism , islamophobia , homophobia .
" to say that -lrb- general soccer violence -rrb- will be stamped out in entirety is difficult , but it seems to be filtering out .
the one thing about the euro championship is that it 's one of the only times players from clubs around europe can come together to play each other .
we need to take the goodness of that and the fact that soccer is for everyone and focus on keeping it . " darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fare program includes advertizing spot broadcasts at every euro 2008 game , pitch-side boards , and activities to encourage intercultural exchanges between fans .
but after the weekend 's violence , it remains to be seen whether these measures are enough to tackle a problem that world soccer is finding hard to shake off .
the aims of the fare campaign stand in stark contrast to the realities presented on sunday in which a minority of fans were heard shouting nazi slogans at polish supporters .
uefa rhetoric on the outbreak suggested the soccer body had accepted that violence is always a possibility at high-stakes soccer matches .
" sensitive matches are dotted around the map of austria and switzerland , you can turn anything into a sensitive match if you think twice about it , " a uefa spokesperson told news agency skysports .
" we are not particularly worried about a single episode .
we have a global concept we apply , match by match and city by city .
it is well rehearsed and we hope also for every match it will work . "
danny lynch , spokesperson for anti-racism organization kick it out , which is involved in the fare euro 2008 campaign , said there would always be a minority who use soccer as a vehicle for disruption .

despite the vast sums spent on match security and anti-discrimination campaigns , ongoing incidents of soccer violence persist across europe at both domestic and international levels of the game .

the fare program includes advertizing spot broadcasts at every euro 2008 game , pitch-side boards , and activities to encourage intercultural exchanges between fans .
but after the weekend 's violence , it remains to be seen whether these measures are enough to tackle a problem that world soccer is finding hard to shake off .
the aims of the fare campaign stand in stark contrast to the realities presented on sunday in which a minority of fans were heard shouting nazi slogans at polish supporters .
uefa rhetoric on the outbreak suggested the soccer body had accepted that violence is always a possibility at high-stakes soccer matches .
" sensitive matches are dotted around the map of austria and switzerland , you can turn anything into a sensitive match if you think twice about it , " a uefa spokesperson told news agency skysports .
" we are not particularly worried about a single episode .
we have a global concept we apply , match by match and city by city .
it is well rehearsed and we hope also for every match it will work . "

with germany celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the introduction of its social-market economy and the d-mark this june , merkel was also at pains to emphasize that these events did not undermine the legitimacy of the existing order .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the ft .
" but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .
my patriotic sensitivity tells me i must stand by these companies in tough times .
we must lead them onto the path of virtue , no question , but one should not condemn them en masse . "

snooping accusations have subsequently been levelled in the media against a number of other firms , such as lufthansa and deutsche bahn .
this comes after investigations into bribery at siemens and corruption at volkswagen .
several former bosses at europe 's biggest carmaker have been prosecuted after it emerged in 2005 that a slush fund was set up to pay for holidays and prostitutes .

but the opposition and migrant organizations have criticised the point of the exercise . the multiple choice test will cover such areas as germany 's political system and society , as well as german history .
the 33 questions will be picked at random from a list of just over 300 .
would-be citizens will have to answer just over half of them correctly .
with the number of people applying for german citizenship in steady declining over recent years , some critics have disputed the necessity of the examination .
others have questioned the sense of something that simply rewards rote learning .
the right approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states of bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg and hesse have pressed for the test green party parliamentarian josef winkler described the test as a " spurious solution for a spurious problem " in an interview with the financial times deutschland .
the left party vice chairwoman halina wawzyniak also described it as " superfluous " .
she called for a comprehensive overhaul of citizenship laws and the relaxation of rules on dual citizenship .
the free democrats ' integration expert sibylle laurischk criticized the content of the test .
" anyone who can learn stuff well off by heart can easily pass a formulaic test of this nature , " she told the ftd .
she called for a flexible approach when evaluating test results , stressing the greater importance of having a good command of the german language .
the chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat , has described the test as a " procedure to select between the educated and the uneducated " .
he said that lower-class migrants would be unable to pass .
in an interview with the epd news agency , kolat accused germany of creating more and more new hurdles to obtaining citizenship , causing migrants , as a result , to increasingly become disaffected .
set to increase alienation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say language classes are more important than swotting for a rote test he said the test reinforced " the feeling of being a foreigner " and predicted a further drop in the number of people applying for citizenship .
an interior ministry spokesman defended the examination .
he said that citizens had both rights and duties .
citizenship tests exist in a number of other european union countries , including the uk and the netherlands .
but organizational difficulties could still stand in the way of the punctual launch of the test .
the questions are still being worked on and are not due to be published until the cabinet have approved them in late july or early august .
ulrich aengenvoort , the director of germany 's volkshochschulen -lrb- vhs -rrb- , the educational institutes charged with conducting the test , conceded that the timetable was tight .

" all options are on the table , " bush warned at a press conference after meeting merkel north of berlin at the end of his last visit to germany before leaving office .
the us preferred a diplomatic solution by working with its partners , bush said .
the five permanent members of the un security council and germany are engaged in efforts to persuade tehran to change course .
there was " a better way forward than isolation " for iran , he said , but he cautioned there could be additional un sanctions on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressuring iran leader ahmadinejad is on bush 's agenda merkel stressed germany 's preference for a diplomatic solution to the impasse , but she warned further sanctions could be applied .
merkel wants better implementation of sanctions " i believe diplomatic pressure has already taken effect , " she said .
merkel called for sanctions already passed by the security council to be better implemented , saying that she preferred the un route as this included russia and china , making sanctions more effective .
this did not exclude further action from the european union , particularly in the banking sector , merkel said .
the two leaders agreed on the need to push forward with the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks , noting that agricultural prices were becoming a crucial issue for developing countries .
bush spoke out against trade protectionism , and merkel highlighted the need for a transatlantic economic partnership - a theme she pressed under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- last year .
cooperation was particularly needed in setting standards for biofuels , merkel said in response to concerns that growing crops for conversion to fuels is resulting in higher food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is pushing for more german military in afghanistan on climate change , bush again stressed the need for the major carbon dioxide emitters among developing countries to be included in efforts to halt global warming .
merkel agreed that countries like india and china needed to be included in climate talks , saying that the german initiative in this regard at last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm would be continued in japan next month .
" we need a global agreement under the united nations , " she said .
bush regrets tone in iraq the two leaders also discussed afghanistan , with bush noting progress in healthcare , education and the economy in what he referred to as a " young democracy " emerging from years of tyranny .
bush was asked whether he regretted the iraq war , in the light of an interview with the times of london , published wednesday , june 11 , that indicated he regretted his rhetoric during the war .
" no i do n't regret it all .
but i could have used better rhetoric , " bush said .
" the decision to remove saddam hussein was the right decision . "
german press negative on visit german commentators noted that the bush visit was remarkable for the complete lack of public protest .
german political and press comment on the 20-hour visit - bush arrived from an eu-us summit in slovenia tuesday evening - was overwhelmingly negative .
" i wo n't miss george w. bush , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's conservative parliamentary bloc , told berlin regional public radio .
ulrich klose , a spokesman for germany 's other main party , the social democrats , the junior partner in merkel 's broad coalition , criticized bush 's foreign policy as " confrontational , " saying this had damaged the standing of the us in the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 11.06.2008 german carmakers welcome modified emissions target großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers worry tough emission limits could hurt luxury manufacturers like daimler as a country that manufactures lots of big cars , germany had the most to lose from eu plans to limit emissions .
but the german car industry has welcomed an alternative german-franco deal as " an acceptable compromise . " the compromise , which trades carbon dioxide emissions efficiency for the use of green technologies , was reached on monday , june 9 , and received a cautiously positive reception from the bloc .
" we welcome the convergence of views between members which have big car industries but it 's a discussion that takes place within the council , with all members , " said european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj .
on december 19 , the commission proposed rules limiting the average co2 emissions of all new cars in europe to 130 grams per kilometer driven by the year 2012 - the 2006 european average was 160 grams per kilometer .
that drew criticism from german chancellor angela merkel and german carmakers .
but in consultations with french president nicolas sarkozy , a compromise was put forth whereby auto manufacturers could receive 8 kilograms per kilometer in " green credits " for using environmentally friendly technologies such as solar power .
carmakers mollified bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy saw eye to eye on the alternative co2 proposal the german-french proposal represented " a clear improvement on a proposition by the european commission , " matthias wissmann , head of the german automobile association vda , told dpa news agency .
bdi confederation of german industry spokesman werner schnappauf called the deal an " acceptable compromise , " paying tribute to merkel for " forcefully representing " the german car industry .
" not everything is clear , " added ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a german car specialist .
" but the solution is softer .
the targets will be easier to reach . "
the german car industry is fearful that tough emission targets could disproportionately penalize luxury cars manufacturers like daimler , bmw and audi with their relatively high fuel consumption and emissions and favor french and italian makers of economy cars .
merkel insists the limit should apply across the range for each carmaker , leaving carmakers the possibility of continuing to introduce high-emission luxury models , so long as they compensate by making low-emission models .
environmentalists angered but germany 's environmentalist party , the greens , were predictably less than happy about the commission 's original proposal potentially being watered down .
german media quoted green parliamentary co-leader renate kuenast as saying that merkel had " once again signed off on all of the german auto manufacturers ' propositions . "
the franco-german agreement " meant nothing good for climate protection , " she added .
but nothing firm has been decided .
while welcoming attempts by germany and french to bridge differences , the eu also said that those two nations could not decide the issue alone .
" the process is still underway , " altafaj said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in an interview published in british daily newspaper the times , bush said his stance over iraq had made the world believe that he was a " guy really anxious for war . "
his use of phrases such as " bring them on " and " dead or alive " had indicated to people that " i was , you know , not a man of peace , " bush said .
" i could have used a different tone " " look , i think that in retrospect , you know , i could have used a different tone , " he told the times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is " painful " to put soldiers in harms way , bush says but the truth was that he found it " very painful to put youngsters in harm 's way " and that he had an obligation to make sure that those lives were not lost in vain , he said .
bush has been widely accused of pressing for military intervention in iraq from shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks , despite little or no evidence of a link with the " 9/11 " hijackers .
the us leader insisted that he had pressed hard for a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
bush calls diplomacy efforts an " untold story " " one of the untold stories of iraq is that we explored diplomacy a lot , " he said .
" we all wanted to solve this ' disclose , disarm , or face serious consequences ' in a diplomatic fashion .
after all , i went to the united nations security council , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush declared combat over in 2003 bush said he was concerned that policies by democratic presidential hopeful barack obama might open divisions in western attitudes towards iran 's nuclear ambitions .
the world ought to work together and " keep focused , " bush told the paper .
bush predicts strategic accord with iraq meanwhile , in a question and answer session following a final state visit to german chancellor angela merkel , bush predicted washington and baghdad would work through rifts and reach a deal on the continued deployment of us forces in iraq .
" i think we 'll end up with a strategic agreement with iraq .
there 's all kinds of noise in their system and our system , " he said .
bush made his comments during a european tour that took him to germany on tuesday and wednesday , june 10 and 11 , and will go on to italy , france and britain . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

one month after the catastrophe the survivors need help .
temporary accommodation , food deliveries and medicine supplies need to be coordinated .
a mobile hospital run by the german red cross has been in the region for about three weeks .
the german aid workers will soon hand over the reins to their chinese colleagues . zhong de the second has digestion problems .
the tiny tot was born three days ago by caesarean section and is with his mother at the mobile red cross hospital in the city of dujiangyan .
zhong de means “ china germany ” - he is the second baby with this name to have been born in this white tent , which the red cross has erected on a closed off part of the local motorway .
the young parents chose the name to express their thanks to the german helpers in the area .
in a few days , zhong de will move to another tent city .
like millions of others in the quake zone , he and his family are likely to live in the open air for an uncertain length of time .
mobile hospital replaces damaged facilities the hospitals in the city of dujiangyan , which has 600,000 inhabitants , are only partly usable at the moment .
the mobile red cross hospital has been able to fill the gap .
it gets about 900 visitors a day - mainly outpatients such as the 78-year-old mrs zhou : “ i have breathing problems .
usually i only have them in winter but since the earthquake i ’ ve been sleeping outside every night in a tent .
that ’ s made me really ill . ”
mrs zhou ’ s husband brought her to the hospital on the back of his bicycle .
next to them waits three-year-old xinrui .
she has had a fever and a sore throat for days says the mother : “ this is the only functioning hospital in dujiangyan .
the others can ’ t do much at all because they don ’ t have the right equipment anymore .
the red cross hospital is the best in the city . ”
usable all over the world the doctors and nurses have all come from the other hospitals .
the german team has taken on a backseat role , giving advice when asked because the philosophy is for local doctors to be able to run the hospital independently of the red cross .
“ our hospital has been set up in such a way that it can be used all over the world , ” explained thomas moch the team leader .
“ here in china we were sub-standard and tried to adapt very quickly to the circumstances .
we brought more technical equipment than we normally would . ”
“ this hospital offers good quality and appropriate technology .
but in contrast to the expectations - in germany too perhaps - we ’ re never fast enough to rescue earthquake victims .
that can ’ t work .
even if we ’ re really very fast we still need five days .
we replace damaged health facilities . ”
handing over agreement treatment in the red cross hospital is still free for the moment and this will continue as part of the handing over agreement to the chinese red cross .
however , after three months , the hospital will be fully integrated into the chinese health system and will function according to the country ’ s conditions .
the transfer should be smooth , thinks thomas moch who says there is a very highly-motivated and well-qualified chinese team .
the young chinese doctor zhu jiang is also full of praise : “ after the earthquake catastrophe , the germans provided exactly the kind of help that was necessary here .

one month after the catastrophe the survivors need help .
temporary accommodation , food deliveries and medicine supplies need to be coordinated .
a mobile hospital run by the german red cross has been in the region for about three weeks .
the german aid workers will soon hand over the reins to their chinese colleagues . zhong de the second has digestion problems .
the tiny tot was born three days ago by caesarean section and is with his mother at the mobile red cross hospital in the city of dujiangyan .
zhong de means “ china germany ” - he is the second baby with this name to have been born in this white tent , which the red cross has erected on a closed off part of the local motorway .
the young parents chose the name to express their thanks to the german helpers in the area .
in a few days , zhong de will move to another tent city .
like millions of others in the quake zone , he and his family are likely to live in the open air for an uncertain length of time .
mobile hospital replaces damaged facilities the hospitals in the city of dujiangyan , which has 600,000 inhabitants , are only partly usable at the moment .
the mobile red cross hospital has been able to fill the gap .
it gets about 900 visitors a day - mainly outpatients such as the 78-year-old mrs zhou : “ i have breathing problems .
usually i only have them in winter but since the earthquake i ’ ve been sleeping outside every night in a tent .
that ’ s made me really ill . ”
mrs zhou ’ s husband brought her to the hospital on the back of his bicycle .
next to them waits three-year-old xinrui .
she has had a fever and a sore throat for days says the mother : “ this is the only functioning hospital in dujiangyan .
the others can ’ t do much at all because they don ’ t have the right equipment anymore .
the red cross hospital is the best in the city . ”
usable all over the world the doctors and nurses have all come from the other hospitals .
the german team has taken on a backseat role , giving advice when asked because the philosophy is for local doctors to be able to run the hospital independently of the red cross .
“ our hospital has been set up in such a way that it can be used all over the world , ” explained thomas moch the team leader .
“ here in china we were sub-standard and tried to adapt very quickly to the circumstances .
we brought more technical equipment than we normally would . ”
“ this hospital offers good quality and appropriate technology .
but in contrast to the expectations - in germany too perhaps - we ’ re never fast enough to rescue earthquake victims .
that can ’ t work .
even if we ’ re really very fast we still need five days .
we replace damaged health facilities . ”
handing over agreement treatment in the red cross hospital is still free for the moment and this will continue as part of the handing over agreement to the chinese red cross .
however , after three months , the hospital will be fully integrated into the chinese health system and will function according to the country ’ s conditions .
the transfer should be smooth , thinks thomas moch who says there is a very highly-motivated and well-qualified chinese team .
the young chinese doctor zhu jiang is also full of praise : “ after the earthquake catastrophe , the germans provided exactly the kind of help that was necessary here .
that ’ s very good .
with the help of modern equipment , the death rate in such situations decreases and patients can be better treated .

the tiny tot was born three days ago by caesarean section and is with his mother at the mobile red cross hospital in the city of dujiangyan .
zhong de means “ china germany ” - he is the second baby with this name to have been born in this white tent , which the red cross has erected on a closed off part of the local motorway .
the young parents chose the name to express their thanks to the german helpers in the area .
in a few days , zhong de will move to another tent city .
like millions of others in the quake zone , he and his family are likely to live in the open air for an uncertain length of time .
mobile hospital replaces damaged facilities the hospitals in the city of dujiangyan , which has 600,000 inhabitants , are only partly usable at the moment .

one month after the catastrophe the survivors need help .
temporary accommodation , food deliveries and medicine supplies need to be coordinated .
a mobile hospital run by the german red cross has been in the region for about three weeks .
the german aid workers will soon hand over the reins to their chinese colleagues . zhong de the second has digestion problems .
the tiny tot was born three days ago by caesarean section and is with his mother at the mobile red cross hospital in the city of dujiangyan .
zhong de means “ china germany ” - he is the second baby with this name to have been born in this white tent , which the red cross has erected on a closed off part of the local motorway .
the young parents chose the name to express their thanks to the german helpers in the area .
in a few days , zhong de will move to another tent city .
like millions of others in the quake zone , he and his family are likely to live in the open air for an uncertain length of time .
mobile hospital replaces damaged facilities the hospitals in the city of dujiangyan , which has 600,000 inhabitants , are only partly usable at the moment .
the mobile red cross hospital has been able to fill the gap .
it gets about 900 visitors a day - mainly outpatients such as the 78-year-old mrs zhou : “ i have breathing problems .
usually i only have them in winter but since the earthquake i ’ ve been sleeping outside every night in a tent .
that ’ s made me really ill . ”
mrs zhou ’ s husband brought her to the hospital on the back of his bicycle .
next to them waits three-year-old xinrui .
she has had a fever and a sore throat for days says the mother : “ this is the only functioning hospital in dujiangyan .
the others can ’ t do much at all because they don ’ t have the right equipment anymore .
the red cross hospital is the best in the city . ”
usable all over the world the doctors and nurses have all come from the other hospitals .
the german team has taken on a backseat role , giving advice when asked because the philosophy is for local doctors to be able to run the hospital independently of the red cross .
“ our hospital has been set up in such a way that it can be used all over the world , ” explained thomas moch the team leader .
“ here in china we were sub-standard and tried to adapt very quickly to the circumstances .
we brought more technical equipment than we normally would . ”
“ this hospital offers good quality and appropriate technology .
but in contrast to the expectations - in germany too perhaps - we ’ re never fast enough to rescue earthquake victims .
that can ’ t work .
even if we ’ re really very fast we still need five days .
we replace damaged health facilities . ”
handing over agreement treatment in the red cross hospital is still free for the moment and this will continue as part of the handing over agreement to the chinese red cross .
however , after three months , the hospital will be fully integrated into the chinese health system and will function according to the country ’ s conditions .
the transfer should be smooth , thinks thomas moch who says there is a very highly-motivated and well-qualified chinese team .
the young chinese doctor zhu jiang is also full of praise : “ after the earthquake catastrophe , the germans provided exactly the kind of help that was necessary here .
that ’ s very good .

the young parents chose the name to express their thanks to the german helpers in the area .
in a few days , zhong de will move to another tent city .
like millions of others in the quake zone , he and his family are likely to live in the open air for an uncertain length of time .
mobile hospital replaces damaged facilities the hospitals in the city of dujiangyan , which has 600,000 inhabitants , are only partly usable at the moment .
the mobile red cross hospital has been able to fill the gap .
it gets about 900 visitors a day - mainly outpatients such as the 78-year-old mrs zhou : “ i have breathing problems .
usually i only have them in winter but since the earthquake i ’ ve been sleeping outside every night in a tent .
that ’ s made me really ill . ”
mrs zhou ’ s husband brought her to the hospital on the back of his bicycle .
next to them waits three-year-old xinrui .
she has had a fever and a sore throat for days says the mother : “ this is the only functioning hospital in dujiangyan .
the others can ’ t do much at all because they don ’ t have the right equipment anymore .
the red cross hospital is the best in the city . ”
usable all over the world the doctors and nurses have all come from the other hospitals .
the german team has taken on a backseat role , giving advice when asked because the philosophy is for local doctors to be able to run the hospital independently of the red cross .
“ our hospital has been set up in such a way that it can be used all over the world , ” explained thomas moch the team leader .
“ here in china we were sub-standard and tried to adapt very quickly to the circumstances .
we brought more technical equipment than we normally would . ”
“ this hospital offers good quality and appropriate technology .
but in contrast to the expectations - in germany too perhaps - we ’ re never fast enough to rescue earthquake victims .
that can ’ t work .
even if we ’ re really very fast we still need five days .
we replace damaged health facilities . ”
handing over agreement treatment in the red cross hospital is still free for the moment and this will continue as part of the handing over agreement to the chinese red cross .
however , after three months , the hospital will be fully integrated into the chinese health system and will function according to the country ’ s conditions .
the transfer should be smooth , thinks thomas moch who says there is a very highly-motivated and well-qualified chinese team .
the young chinese doctor zhu jiang is also full of praise : “ after the earthquake catastrophe , the germans provided exactly the kind of help that was necessary here .
that ’ s very good .
with the help of modern equipment , the death rate in such situations decreases and patients can be better treated .

with germany celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the introduction of its social-market economy and the d-mark this june , merkel was also at pains to emphasize that these events did not undermine the legitimacy of the existing order .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the ft .
" but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .
my patriotic sensitivity tells me i must stand by these companies in tough times .
we must lead them onto the path of virtue , no question , but one should not condemn them en masse . "
one allegation after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender of the business faith : angela merkel just under two weeks ago , deutsche telekom ceo called in prosecutors to investigate allegations that the company had engaged a data-mining firm to track thousands of calls between top executives and journalists .

this comes after investigations into bribery at siemens and corruption at volkswagen .

the fare program includes advertizing spot broadcasts at every euro 2008 game , pitch-side boards , and activities to encourage intercultural exchanges between fans .
but after the weekend 's violence , it remains to be seen whether these measures are enough to tackle a problem that world soccer is finding hard to shake off .
the aims of the fare campaign stand in stark contrast to the realities presented on sunday in which a minority of fans were heard shouting nazi slogans at polish supporters .
uefa rhetoric on the outbreak suggested the soccer body had accepted that violence is always a possibility at high-stakes soccer matches .
" sensitive matches are dotted around the map of austria and switzerland , you can turn anything into a sensitive match if you think twice about it , " a uefa spokesperson told news agency skysports .
" we are not particularly worried about a single episode .
we have a global concept we apply , match by match and city by city .
it is well rehearsed and we hope also for every match it will work . "
danny lynch , spokesperson for anti-racism organization kick it out , which is involved in the fare euro 2008 campaign , said there would always be a minority who use soccer as a vehicle for disruption .
" the events on sunday were carried out by people who have no interest in -lrb- harmonious and respectful ways -rrb- whatsoever .
these far-right groups with links to nazi organizations … thrive on disorder and disruption . "
switzerland prepares for the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and austrian police march off violent fans in klagenfurt in switzerland , attempts to pre-empt violence included written letters to 300 known soccer thugs around europe , warning them that violence at euro 2008 would not be tolerated .
the swiss authorities also converted part of geneva 's palexpo convention center into a temporary detainment hall for soccer thugs and allocated $ 61 million for security at the tournament uefa also shelled out money to battle discrimination at euro 2008 , with over 300,000 euros going toward the fare unite against racism campaign .
despite the vast sums spent on match security and anti-discrimination campaigns , ongoing incidents of soccer violence persist across europe at both domestic and international levels of the game .
" in the uk we 've seen a decrease generally in soccer violence , but at the same time you look at the uefa cup final when glasgow supporters were fighting with police , " said lynch .
" in italy fans are fighting amongst each other .
there are still fans that just go out to fight . "
the problem continues bildunterschrift : german hooligans continue from where they left off in 2006 although kick it out holds hopes that one day soccer can be violence-and-racism-free , danny lynch admits that such problems will likely exist in one form or another for some time to come .
" soccer is unique in many ways , but for 90 minutes there are 30,000 people sat around a field in a situation that they ordinarily would n't be in .
this is the excuse that these people use to have a fight , " he said .
" if you look at the english game 20 years ago , fighting on the terraces was a common event .
now , we do n't see that .
what we do see is a new style of racist abuse : anti-semitism , islamophobia , homophobia .
" to say that -lrb- general soccer violence -rrb- will be stamped out in entirety is difficult , but it seems to be filtering out .
the one thing about the euro championship is that it 's one of the only times players from clubs around europe can come together to play each other .
we need to take the goodness of that and the fact that soccer is for everyone and focus on keeping it . " darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with germany celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the introduction of its social-market economy and the d-mark this june , merkel was also at pains to emphasize that these events did not undermine the legitimacy of the existing order .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the ft .
" but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .
my patriotic sensitivity tells me i must stand by these companies in tough times .
we must lead them onto the path of virtue , no question , but one should not condemn them en masse . "
one allegation after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender of the business faith : angela merkel just under two weeks ago , deutsche telekom ceo called in prosecutors to investigate allegations that the company had engaged a data-mining firm to track thousands of calls between top executives and journalists .
snooping accusations have subsequently been levelled in the media against a number of other firms , such as lufthansa and deutsche bahn .
this comes after investigations into bribery at siemens and corruption at volkswagen .
several former bosses at europe 's biggest carmaker have been prosecuted after it emerged in 2005 that a slush fund was set up to pay for holidays and prostitutes .
these scandals and allegations of tax evasion by germany 's high earners earlier this year have stirred up widespread resentment towards the country 's business elite . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 11.06.2008 german carmakers welcome modified emissions target großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers worry tough emission limits could hurt luxury manufacturers like daimler as a country that manufactures lots of big cars , germany had the most to lose from eu plans to limit emissions .
but the german car industry has welcomed an alternative german-franco deal as " an acceptable compromise . " the compromise , which trades carbon dioxide emissions efficiency for the use of green technologies , was reached on monday , june 9 , and received a cautiously positive reception from the bloc .
" we welcome the convergence of views between members which have big car industries but it 's a discussion that takes place within the council , with all members , " said european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj .
on december 19 , the commission proposed rules limiting the average co2 emissions of all new cars in europe to 130 grams per kilometer driven by the year 2012 - the 2006 european average was 160 grams per kilometer .
that drew criticism from german chancellor angela merkel and german carmakers .
but in consultations with french president nicolas sarkozy , a compromise was put forth whereby auto manufacturers could receive 8 kilograms per kilometer in " green credits " for using environmentally friendly technologies such as solar power .
carmakers mollified bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy saw eye to eye on the alternative co2 proposal the german-french proposal represented " a clear improvement on a proposition by the european commission , " matthias wissmann , head of the german automobile association vda , told dpa news agency .
bdi confederation of german industry spokesman werner schnappauf called the deal an " acceptable compromise , " paying tribute to merkel for " forcefully representing " the german car industry .
" not everything is clear , " added ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a german car specialist .
" but the solution is softer .
the targets will be easier to reach . "
the german car industry is fearful that tough emission targets could disproportionately penalize luxury cars manufacturers like daimler , bmw and audi with their relatively high fuel consumption and emissions and favor french and italian makers of economy cars .
merkel insists the limit should apply across the range for each carmaker , leaving carmakers the possibility of continuing to introduce high-emission luxury models , so long as they compensate by making low-emission models .
environmentalists angered but germany 's environmentalist party , the greens , were predictably less than happy about the commission 's original proposal potentially being watered down .
german media quoted green parliamentary co-leader renate kuenast as saying that merkel had " once again signed off on all of the german auto manufacturers ' propositions . "
the franco-german agreement " meant nothing good for climate protection , " she added .
but nothing firm has been decided .
while welcoming attempts by germany and french to bridge differences , the eu also said that those two nations could not decide the issue alone .
" the process is still underway , " altafaj said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland goes to the polls thursday in the european union 's only referendum on the lisbon treaty .
eu and irish leaders are holding their collective breath as they hope to avoid disaster . with a traditional eve-of-vote news blackout in operation in ireland on wednesday , the country 's three leading political parties , who have pushed hard for a yes vote , were cautious ahead of the referendum .
as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .
he added that europe would go back to an uncertain situation if the lisbon treaty was defeated .
cowen emphasized that all of ireland 's concerns had been catered to in the treaty , rte reported .
he said it was his deeply held belief that the lisbon treaty was crucial to ireland 's future prospects .
he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .
" the most recent numbers are fairly positive , " stubb said .
the irish referendum topped the agenda of the talks , which also centered on the situation in the middle east , relations with moscow and baltic sea issues . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the opposition and migrant organizations have criticised the point of the exercise . the multiple choice test will cover such areas as germany 's political system and society , as well as german history .
the 33 questions will be picked at random from a list of just over 300 .
would-be citizens will have to answer just over half of them correctly .
with the number of people applying for german citizenship in steady declining over recent years , some critics have disputed the necessity of the examination .
others have questioned the sense of something that simply rewards rote learning .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states of bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg and hesse have pressed for the test green party parliamentarian josef winkler described the test as a " spurious solution for a spurious problem " in an interview with the financial times deutschland .
the left party vice chairwoman halina wawzyniak also described it as " superfluous " .
she called for a comprehensive overhaul of citizenship laws and the relaxation of rules on dual citizenship .
the free democrats ' integration expert sibylle laurischk criticized the content of the test .
" anyone who can learn stuff well off by heart can easily pass a formulaic test of this nature , " she told the ftd .
she called for a flexible approach when evaluating test results , stressing the greater importance of having a good command of the german language .
the chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat , has described the test as a " procedure to select between the educated and the uneducated " .
he said that lower-class migrants would be unable to pass .
in an interview with the epd news agency , kolat accused germany of creating more and more new hurdles to obtaining citizenship , causing migrants , as a result , to increasingly become disaffected .

he said that citizens had both rights and duties .
citizenship tests exist in a number of other european union countries , including the uk and the netherlands .
but organizational difficulties could still stand in the way of the punctual launch of the test .
the questions are still being worked on and are not due to be published until the cabinet have approved them in late july or early august .

" all options are on the table , " bush warned at a press conference after meeting merkel north of berlin at the end of his last visit to germany before leaving office .
the us preferred a diplomatic solution by working with its partners , bush said .
the five permanent members of the un security council and germany are engaged in efforts to persuade tehran to change course .
there was " a better way forward than isolation " for iran , he said , but he cautioned there could be additional un sanctions on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressuring iran leader ahmadinejad is on bush 's agenda merkel stressed germany 's preference for a diplomatic solution to the impasse , but she warned further sanctions could be applied .
merkel wants better implementation of sanctions " i believe diplomatic pressure has already taken effect , " she said .
merkel called for sanctions already passed by the security council to be better implemented , saying that she preferred the un route as this included russia and china , making sanctions more effective .
this did not exclude further action from the european union , particularly in the banking sector , merkel said .
the two leaders agreed on the need to push forward with the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks , noting that agricultural prices were becoming a crucial issue for developing countries .
bush spoke out against trade protectionism , and merkel highlighted the need for a transatlantic economic partnership - a theme she pressed under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- last year .
cooperation was particularly needed in setting standards for biofuels , merkel said in response to concerns that growing crops for conversion to fuels is resulting in higher food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is pushing for more german military in afghanistan on climate change , bush again stressed the need for the major carbon dioxide emitters among developing countries to be included in efforts to halt global warming .
merkel agreed that countries like india and china needed to be included in climate talks , saying that the german initiative in this regard at last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm would be continued in japan next month .
" we need a global agreement under the united nations , " she said .
bush regrets tone in iraq the two leaders also discussed afghanistan , with bush noting progress in healthcare , education and the economy in what he referred to as a " young democracy " emerging from years of tyranny .
bush was asked whether he regretted the iraq war , in the light of an interview with the times of london , published wednesday , june 11 , that indicated he regretted his rhetoric during the war .
" no i do n't regret it all .
but i could have used better rhetoric , " bush said .
" the decision to remove saddam hussein was the right decision . "
german press negative on visit german commentators noted that the bush visit was remarkable for the complete lack of public protest .
german political and press comment on the 20-hour visit - bush arrived from an eu-us summit in slovenia tuesday evening - was overwhelmingly negative .
" i wo n't miss george w. bush , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's conservative parliamentary bloc , told berlin regional public radio .
ulrich klose , a spokesman for germany 's other main party , the social democrats , the junior partner in merkel 's broad coalition , criticized bush 's foreign policy as " confrontational , " saying this had damaged the standing of the us in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel returned hospitality extended in crawford , texas even merkel , who has maintained friendly personal relations with the president throughout , looked ahead to the post-bush era that begins in january .
merkel looks to new chapter " this is his last european trip .
a new period will then begin , " she said .
bush arrived on his farewell visit to germany tuesday from the eu-us summit in brdo , slovenia to spend the night at schloss meseberg , the baroque palace north of the capital that the german government uses as a guesthouse .
from berlin , the president flew to rome , where apart from prime minister silvio berlusconi , he was to meet pope benedict xvi .
bush is to pay brief final visits to paris , london and belfast in northern ireland , before returning to the us . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the croats have lots of players who ply their trade in the bundesliga .
and a decade ago , the croatian national team proved it could -lrb- man- -rrb- handle the germans . when the members of those two national squads take the pitch on thursday , june 12 in klagenfurt , those with keen memories might be thinking about the past .
in the latter half of the 1990s , the two sides became minor rivals after meeting twice in the space of two years in the quarter-finals of international tournaments .
one person who remembers those encounters very well is germany 's team manager oliver bierhoff , who played on both of those german teams .
it 's hardly surprising then that bierhoff has drawn parallels between the current squad and the one that beat the croats 2-1 in euro 1996 in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff wants germany to think of 1996 " we work very precisely - that 's one of the similarities - but in 1996 we had a lot of experienced players who had won major titles with their clubs and country , " the former striker told the online edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" the current team is a bit more hungry for and curious about what it 's like to win than was the case in 1996 , " bierhoff said .
that game was the first time germany had played post-yugoslavian croatia in a match that counted .
germany went on to win euro 96 , their last major title , thanks to a golden goal by bierhoff .
french fiasco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suker and croatia punished lothar matthaeus and germany in 1998 but two years later , at the 1998 world cup in france , the croats got revenge - and how .
after defender christian woerns was sent off in first half , croatia made a meal of their opponents , winning 3-0 .
the man of the match was croatian striker davor suker , who scored one goal and provoked the foul that left the germans shorthanded .
it was germany 's worst world cup defeat in 44 years and cost coach berti vogts , who had masterminded the 1996 euro win , his job .
" i thought it would be a one-goal game , " vogts said immediately after the debacle .
croatia lost to eventual winners france in the semis and came in third - that 's still the best-ever result for the team , which has only existed in its current form since 1990 .
intimate acquaintances bildunterschrift : croatia 's niko kovac , l , played 15 years in the bundesliga whether the players on thursday know their history is one thing .
what 's beyond doubt is that they know each other .
seven members of the croatian squad play or have played extensively in the german bundesliga .
five of them started in croatia 's lackluster 1-0 opening win against austria .
so how do they reckon their chances ?
" if we play like we did the second half -lrb- against austria -rrb- , we 'll have huge problems versus germany , " defender josip simunic , who plays for hertha berlin , cautioned after that first match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and his brother robert also knows germany inside and out but midfielder niko kovac , who did long stints at hertha , leverkusen and hamburg , has been more optimistic .
" against austria , we had enormous psychological pressure , which paralyzed us for a while , " kovac said .
" we had to win .
now we can and will play much more freely . "
but the pressure wo n't be as extreme on thursday as in either match from the 1990s .
while a win would send either croatia or germany through to the quarterfinals , both teams would stay alive in the group stage , even if they lose . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all options are on the table , " bush warned at a press conference after meeting merkel north of berlin at the end of his last visit to germany before leaving office .
the us preferred a diplomatic solution by working with its partners , bush said .
the five permanent members of the un security council and germany are engaged in efforts to persuade tehran to change course .
there was " a better way forward than isolation " for iran , he said , but he cautioned there could be additional un sanctions on iran .

merkel wants better implementation of sanctions " i believe diplomatic pressure has already taken effect , " she said .
merkel called for sanctions already passed by the security council to be better implemented , saying that she preferred the un route as this included russia and china , making sanctions more effective .
this did not exclude further action from the european union , particularly in the banking sector , merkel said .
the two leaders agreed on the need to push forward with the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks , noting that agricultural prices were becoming a crucial issue for developing countries .
bush spoke out against trade protectionism , and merkel highlighted the need for a transatlantic economic partnership - a theme she pressed under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- last year .
cooperation was particularly needed in setting standards for biofuels , merkel said in response to concerns that growing crops for conversion to fuels is resulting in higher food prices .

" we need a global agreement under the united nations , " she said .
bush regrets tone in iraq the two leaders also discussed afghanistan , with bush noting progress in healthcare , education and the economy in what he referred to as a " young democracy " emerging from years of tyranny .
bush was asked whether he regretted the iraq war , in the light of an interview with the times of london , published wednesday , june 11 , that indicated he regretted his rhetoric during the war .
" no i do n't regret it all .
but i could have used better rhetoric , " bush said .
" the decision to remove saddam hussein was the right decision . "
german press negative on visit german commentators noted that the bush visit was remarkable for the complete lack of public protest .
german political and press comment on the 20-hour visit - bush arrived from an eu-us summit in slovenia tuesday evening - was overwhelmingly negative .
" i wo n't miss george w. bush , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's conservative parliamentary bloc , told berlin regional public radio .

but the croats have lots of players who ply their trade in the bundesliga .
and a decade ago , the croatian national team proved it could -lrb- man- -rrb- handle the germans . when the members of those two national squads take the pitch on thursday , june 12 in klagenfurt , those with keen memories might be thinking about the past .
in the latter half of the 1990s , the two sides became minor rivals after meeting twice in the space of two years in the quarter-finals of international tournaments .
one person who remembers those encounters very well is germany 's team manager oliver bierhoff , who played on both of those german teams .
it 's hardly surprising then that bierhoff has drawn parallels between the current squad and the one that beat the croats 2-1 in euro 1996 in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff wants germany to think of 1996 " we work very precisely - that 's one of the similarities - but in 1996 we had a lot of experienced players who had won major titles with their clubs and country , " the former striker told the online edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" the current team is a bit more hungry for and curious about what it 's like to win than was the case in 1996 , " bierhoff said .
that game was the first time germany had played post-yugoslavian croatia in a match that counted .
germany went on to win euro 96 , their last major title , thanks to a golden goal by bierhoff .
french fiasco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suker and croatia punished lothar matthaeus and germany in 1998 but two years later , at the 1998 world cup in france , the croats got revenge - and how .
after defender christian woerns was sent off in first half , croatia made a meal of their opponents , winning 3-0 .
the man of the match was croatian striker davor suker , who scored one goal and provoked the foul that left the germans shorthanded .
it was germany 's worst world cup defeat in 44 years and cost coach berti vogts , who had masterminded the 1996 euro win , his job .
" i thought it would be a one-goal game , " vogts said immediately after the debacle .
croatia lost to eventual winners france in the semis and came in third - that 's still the best-ever result for the team , which has only existed in its current form since 1990 .
intimate acquaintances bildunterschrift : croatia 's niko kovac , l , played 15 years in the bundesliga whether the players on thursday know their history is one thing .
what 's beyond doubt is that they know each other .
seven members of the croatian squad play or have played extensively in the german bundesliga .
five of them started in croatia 's lackluster 1-0 opening win against austria .
so how do they reckon their chances ?
" if we play like we did the second half -lrb- against austria -rrb- , we 'll have huge problems versus germany , " defender josip simunic , who plays for hertha berlin , cautioned after that first match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and his brother robert also knows germany inside and out but midfielder niko kovac , who did long stints at hertha , leverkusen and hamburg , has been more optimistic .
" against austria , we had enormous psychological pressure , which paralyzed us for a while , " kovac said .
" we had to win .
now we can and will play much more freely . "
but the pressure wo n't be as extreme on thursday as in either match from the 1990s .
while a win would send either croatia or germany through to the quarterfinals , both teams would stay alive in the group stage , even if they lose . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the latter half of the 1990s , the two sides became minor rivals after meeting twice in the space of two years in the quarter-finals of international tournaments .
one person who remembers those encounters very well is germany 's team manager oliver bierhoff , who played on both of those german teams .
it 's hardly surprising then that bierhoff has drawn parallels between the current squad and the one that beat the croats 2-1 in euro 1996 in england .

" the current team is a bit more hungry for and curious about what it 's like to win than was the case in 1996 , " bierhoff said .

with germany celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the introduction of its social-market economy and the d-mark this june , merkel was also at pains to emphasize that these events did not undermine the legitimacy of the existing order .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the ft .
" but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .

this comes after investigations into bribery at siemens and corruption at volkswagen .

ireland goes to the polls thursday in the european union 's only referendum on the lisbon treaty .
eu and irish leaders are holding their collective breath as they hope to avoid disaster . with a traditional eve-of-vote news blackout in operation in ireland on wednesday , the country 's three leading political parties , who have pushed hard for a yes vote , were cautious ahead of the referendum .
as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .
he added that europe would go back to an uncertain situation if the lisbon treaty was defeated .
cowen emphasized that all of ireland 's concerns had been catered to in the treaty , rte reported .
he said it was his deeply held belief that the lisbon treaty was crucial to ireland 's future prospects .
he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .
" the most recent numbers are fairly positive , " stubb said .
the irish referendum topped the agenda of the talks , which also centered on the situation in the middle east , relations with moscow and baltic sea issues . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland goes to the polls thursday in the european union 's only referendum on the lisbon treaty .
eu and irish leaders are holding their collective breath as they hope to avoid disaster . with a traditional eve-of-vote news blackout in operation in ireland on wednesday , the country 's three leading political parties , who have pushed hard for a yes vote , were cautious ahead of the referendum .
as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .
he added that europe would go back to an uncertain situation if the lisbon treaty was defeated .
cowen emphasized that all of ireland 's concerns had been catered to in the treaty , rte reported .
he said it was his deeply held belief that the lisbon treaty was crucial to ireland 's future prospects .
he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .

ireland goes to the polls thursday in the european union 's only referendum on the lisbon treaty .
eu and irish leaders are holding their collective breath as they hope to avoid disaster . with a traditional eve-of-vote news blackout in operation in ireland on wednesday , the country 's three leading political parties , who have pushed hard for a yes vote , were cautious ahead of the referendum .
as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .

but the opposition and migrant organizations have criticised the point of the exercise . the multiple choice test will cover such areas as germany 's political system and society , as well as german history .
the 33 questions will be picked at random from a list of just over 300 .
would-be citizens will have to answer just over half of them correctly .
with the number of people applying for german citizenship in steady declining over recent years , some critics have disputed the necessity of the examination .
others have questioned the sense of something that simply rewards rote learning .
the right approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states of bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg and hesse have pressed for the test green party parliamentarian josef winkler described the test as a " spurious solution for a spurious problem " in an interview with the financial times deutschland .
the left party vice chairwoman halina wawzyniak also described it as " superfluous " .
she called for a comprehensive overhaul of citizenship laws and the relaxation of rules on dual citizenship .
the free democrats ' integration expert sibylle laurischk criticized the content of the test .
" anyone who can learn stuff well off by heart can easily pass a formulaic test of this nature , " she told the ftd .
she called for a flexible approach when evaluating test results , stressing the greater importance of having a good command of the german language .
the chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat , has described the test as a " procedure to select between the educated and the uneducated " .
he said that lower-class migrants would be unable to pass .
in an interview with the epd news agency , kolat accused germany of creating more and more new hurdles to obtaining citizenship , causing migrants , as a result , to increasingly become disaffected .
set to increase alienation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say language classes are more important than swotting for a rote test he said the test reinforced " the feeling of being a foreigner " and predicted a further drop in the number of people applying for citizenship .
an interior ministry spokesman defended the examination .
he said that citizens had both rights and duties .
citizenship tests exist in a number of other european union countries , including the uk and the netherlands .
but organizational difficulties could still stand in the way of the punctual launch of the test .
the questions are still being worked on and are not due to be published until the cabinet have approved them in late july or early august .
ulrich aengenvoort , the director of germany 's volkshochschulen -lrb- vhs -rrb- , the educational institutes charged with conducting the test , conceded that the timetable was tight .
however , he said he was confident that the vhs would cope . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all options are on the table , " bush warned at a press conference after meeting merkel north of berlin at the end of his last visit to germany before leaving office .
the us preferred a diplomatic solution by working with its partners , bush said .
the five permanent members of the un security council and germany are engaged in efforts to persuade tehran to change course .
there was " a better way forward than isolation " for iran , he said , but he cautioned there could be additional un sanctions on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressuring iran leader ahmadinejad is on bush 's agenda merkel stressed germany 's preference for a diplomatic solution to the impasse , but she warned further sanctions could be applied .
merkel wants better implementation of sanctions " i believe diplomatic pressure has already taken effect , " she said .
merkel called for sanctions already passed by the security council to be better implemented , saying that she preferred the un route as this included russia and china , making sanctions more effective .
this did not exclude further action from the european union , particularly in the banking sector , merkel said .
the two leaders agreed on the need to push forward with the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks , noting that agricultural prices were becoming a crucial issue for developing countries .
bush spoke out against trade protectionism , and merkel highlighted the need for a transatlantic economic partnership - a theme she pressed under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- last year .
cooperation was particularly needed in setting standards for biofuels , merkel said in response to concerns that growing crops for conversion to fuels is resulting in higher food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is pushing for more german military in afghanistan on climate change , bush again stressed the need for the major carbon dioxide emitters among developing countries to be included in efforts to halt global warming .
merkel agreed that countries like india and china needed to be included in climate talks , saying that the german initiative in this regard at last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm would be continued in japan next month .
" we need a global agreement under the united nations , " she said .
bush regrets tone in iraq the two leaders also discussed afghanistan , with bush noting progress in healthcare , education and the economy in what he referred to as a " young democracy " emerging from years of tyranny .
bush was asked whether he regretted the iraq war , in the light of an interview with the times of london , published wednesday , june 11 , that indicated he regretted his rhetoric during the war .
" no i do n't regret it all .
but i could have used better rhetoric , " bush said .
" the decision to remove saddam hussein was the right decision . "
german press negative on visit german commentators noted that the bush visit was remarkable for the complete lack of public protest .
german political and press comment on the 20-hour visit - bush arrived from an eu-us summit in slovenia tuesday evening - was overwhelmingly negative .
" i wo n't miss george w. bush , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's conservative parliamentary bloc , told berlin regional public radio .
ulrich klose , a spokesman for germany 's other main party , the social democrats , the junior partner in merkel 's broad coalition , criticized bush 's foreign policy as " confrontational , " saying this had damaged the standing of the us in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel returned hospitality extended in crawford , texas even merkel , who has maintained friendly personal relations with the president throughout , looked ahead to the post-bush era that begins in january .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 11.06.2008 eu braces for irish referendum under threat of treaty chaos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish referendum hangs in the balance - along with the future of the lisbon treaty ?
ireland goes to the polls thursday in the european union 's only referendum on the lisbon treaty .
eu and irish leaders are holding their collective breath as they hope to avoid disaster . with a traditional eve-of-vote news blackout in operation in ireland on wednesday , the country 's three leading political parties , who have pushed hard for a yes vote , were cautious ahead of the referendum .
as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .
he added that europe would go back to an uncertain situation if the lisbon treaty was defeated .
cowen emphasized that all of ireland 's concerns had been catered to in the treaty , rte reported .
he said it was his deeply held belief that the lisbon treaty was crucial to ireland 's future prospects .
he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .
" the most recent numbers are fairly positive , " stubb said .
the irish referendum topped the agenda of the talks , which also centered on the situation in the middle east , relations with moscow and baltic sea issues . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fare program includes advertizing spot broadcasts at every euro 2008 game , pitch-side boards , and activities to encourage intercultural exchanges between fans .
but after the weekend 's violence , it remains to be seen whether these measures are enough to tackle a problem that world soccer is finding hard to shake off .
the aims of the fare campaign stand in stark contrast to the realities presented on sunday in which a minority of fans were heard shouting nazi slogans at polish supporters .
uefa rhetoric on the outbreak suggested the soccer body had accepted that violence is always a possibility at high-stakes soccer matches .
" sensitive matches are dotted around the map of austria and switzerland , you can turn anything into a sensitive match if you think twice about it , " a uefa spokesperson told news agency skysports .
" we are not particularly worried about a single episode .
we have a global concept we apply , match by match and city by city .
it is well rehearsed and we hope also for every match it will work . "
danny lynch , spokesperson for anti-racism organization kick it out , which is involved in the fare euro 2008 campaign , said there would always be a minority who use soccer as a vehicle for disruption .
" the events on sunday were carried out by people who have no interest in -lrb- harmonious and respectful ways -rrb- whatsoever .
these far-right groups with links to nazi organizations … thrive on disorder and disruption . "
switzerland prepares for the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and austrian police march off violent fans in klagenfurt in switzerland , attempts to pre-empt violence included written letters to 300 known soccer thugs around europe , warning them that violence at euro 2008 would not be tolerated .
the swiss authorities also converted part of geneva 's palexpo convention center into a temporary detainment hall for soccer thugs and allocated $ 61 million for security at the tournament uefa also shelled out money to battle discrimination at euro 2008 , with over 300,000 euros going toward the fare unite against racism campaign .
despite the vast sums spent on match security and anti-discrimination campaigns , ongoing incidents of soccer violence persist across europe at both domestic and international levels of the game .
" in the uk we 've seen a decrease generally in soccer violence , but at the same time you look at the uefa cup final when glasgow supporters were fighting with police , " said lynch .
" in italy fans are fighting amongst each other .
there are still fans that just go out to fight . "
the problem continues bildunterschrift : german hooligans continue from where they left off in 2006 although kick it out holds hopes that one day soccer can be violence-and-racism-free , danny lynch admits that such problems will likely exist in one form or another for some time to come .
" soccer is unique in many ways , but for 90 minutes there are 30,000 people sat around a field in a situation that they ordinarily would n't be in .
this is the excuse that these people use to have a fight , " he said .
" if you look at the english game 20 years ago , fighting on the terraces was a common event .
now , we do n't see that .
what we do see is a new style of racist abuse : anti-semitism , islamophobia , homophobia .
" to say that -lrb- general soccer violence -rrb- will be stamped out in entirety is difficult , but it seems to be filtering out .
the one thing about the euro championship is that it 's one of the only times players from clubs around europe can come together to play each other .
we need to take the goodness of that and the fact that soccer is for everyone and focus on keeping it . " darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fare program includes advertizing spot broadcasts at every euro 2008 game , pitch-side boards , and activities to encourage intercultural exchanges between fans .
but after the weekend 's violence , it remains to be seen whether these measures are enough to tackle a problem that world soccer is finding hard to shake off .
the aims of the fare campaign stand in stark contrast to the realities presented on sunday in which a minority of fans were heard shouting nazi slogans at polish supporters .
uefa rhetoric on the outbreak suggested the soccer body had accepted that violence is always a possibility at high-stakes soccer matches .
" sensitive matches are dotted around the map of austria and switzerland , you can turn anything into a sensitive match if you think twice about it , " a uefa spokesperson told news agency skysports .
" we are not particularly worried about a single episode .
we have a global concept we apply , match by match and city by city .
it is well rehearsed and we hope also for every match it will work . "
danny lynch , spokesperson for anti-racism organization kick it out , which is involved in the fare euro 2008 campaign , said there would always be a minority who use soccer as a vehicle for disruption .
" the events on sunday were carried out by people who have no interest in -lrb- harmonious and respectful ways -rrb- whatsoever .
these far-right groups with links to nazi organizations … thrive on disorder and disruption . "
switzerland prepares for the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and austrian police march off violent fans in klagenfurt in switzerland , attempts to pre-empt violence included written letters to 300 known soccer thugs around europe , warning them that violence at euro 2008 would not be tolerated .
the swiss authorities also converted part of geneva 's palexpo convention center into a temporary detainment hall for soccer thugs and allocated $ 61 million for security at the tournament uefa also shelled out money to battle discrimination at euro 2008 , with over 300,000 euros going toward the fare unite against racism campaign .
despite the vast sums spent on match security and anti-discrimination campaigns , ongoing incidents of soccer violence persist across europe at both domestic and international levels of the game .
" in the uk we 've seen a decrease generally in soccer violence , but at the same time you look at the uefa cup final when glasgow supporters were fighting with police , " said lynch .
" in italy fans are fighting amongst each other .
there are still fans that just go out to fight . "
the problem continues bildunterschrift : german hooligans continue from where they left off in 2006 although kick it out holds hopes that one day soccer can be violence-and-racism-free , danny lynch admits that such problems will likely exist in one form or another for some time to come .
" soccer is unique in many ways , but for 90 minutes there are 30,000 people sat around a field in a situation that they ordinarily would n't be in .
this is the excuse that these people use to have a fight , " he said .
" if you look at the english game 20 years ago , fighting on the terraces was a common event .
now , we do n't see that .
what we do see is a new style of racist abuse : anti-semitism , islamophobia , homophobia .
" to say that -lrb- general soccer violence -rrb- will be stamped out in entirety is difficult , but it seems to be filtering out .
the one thing about the euro championship is that it 's one of the only times players from clubs around europe can come together to play each other .

but the opposition and migrant organizations have criticised the point of the exercise . the multiple choice test will cover such areas as germany 's political system and society , as well as german history .
the 33 questions will be picked at random from a list of just over 300 .
would-be citizens will have to answer just over half of them correctly .
with the number of people applying for german citizenship in steady declining over recent years , some critics have disputed the necessity of the examination .
others have questioned the sense of something that simply rewards rote learning .
the right approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states of bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg and hesse have pressed for the test green party parliamentarian josef winkler described the test as a " spurious solution for a spurious problem " in an interview with the financial times deutschland .
the left party vice chairwoman halina wawzyniak also described it as " superfluous " .
she called for a comprehensive overhaul of citizenship laws and the relaxation of rules on dual citizenship .
the free democrats ' integration expert sibylle laurischk criticized the content of the test .
" anyone who can learn stuff well off by heart can easily pass a formulaic test of this nature , " she told the ftd .
she called for a flexible approach when evaluating test results , stressing the greater importance of having a good command of the german language .
the chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat , has described the test as a " procedure to select between the educated and the uneducated " .
he said that lower-class migrants would be unable to pass .
in an interview with the epd news agency , kolat accused germany of creating more and more new hurdles to obtaining citizenship , causing migrants , as a result , to increasingly become disaffected .
set to increase alienation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say language classes are more important than swotting for a rote test he said the test reinforced " the feeling of being a foreigner " and predicted a further drop in the number of people applying for citizenship .
an interior ministry spokesman defended the examination .
he said that citizens had both rights and duties .
citizenship tests exist in a number of other european union countries , including the uk and the netherlands .
but organizational difficulties could still stand in the way of the punctual launch of the test .
the questions are still being worked on and are not due to be published until the cabinet have approved them in late july or early august .
ulrich aengenvoort , the director of germany 's volkshochschulen -lrb- vhs -rrb- , the educational institutes charged with conducting the test , conceded that the timetable was tight .
however , he said he was confident that the vhs would cope . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with germany celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the introduction of its social-market economy and the d-mark this june , merkel was also at pains to emphasize that these events did not undermine the legitimacy of the existing order .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the ft .
" but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .
my patriotic sensitivity tells me i must stand by these companies in tough times .
we must lead them onto the path of virtue , no question , but one should not condemn them en masse . "
one allegation after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender of the business faith : angela merkel just under two weeks ago , deutsche telekom ceo called in prosecutors to investigate allegations that the company had engaged a data-mining firm to track thousands of calls between top executives and journalists .
snooping accusations have subsequently been levelled in the media against a number of other firms , such as lufthansa and deutsche bahn .
this comes after investigations into bribery at siemens and corruption at volkswagen .
several former bosses at europe 's biggest carmaker have been prosecuted after it emerged in 2005 that a slush fund was set up to pay for holidays and prostitutes .
these scandals and allegations of tax evasion by germany 's high earners earlier this year have stirred up widespread resentment towards the country 's business elite . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all options are on the table , " bush warned at a press conference after meeting merkel north of berlin at the end of his last visit to germany before leaving office .
the us preferred a diplomatic solution by working with its partners , bush said .
the five permanent members of the un security council and germany are engaged in efforts to persuade tehran to change course .
there was " a better way forward than isolation " for iran , he said , but he cautioned there could be additional un sanctions on iran .

merkel called for sanctions already passed by the security council to be better implemented , saying that she preferred the un route as this included russia and china , making sanctions more effective .
this did not exclude further action from the european union , particularly in the banking sector , merkel said .
the two leaders agreed on the need to push forward with the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks , noting that agricultural prices were becoming a crucial issue for developing countries .
bush spoke out against trade protectionism , and merkel highlighted the need for a transatlantic economic partnership - a theme she pressed under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- last year .
cooperation was particularly needed in setting standards for biofuels , merkel said in response to concerns that growing crops for conversion to fuels is resulting in higher food prices .

bush regrets tone in iraq the two leaders also discussed afghanistan , with bush noting progress in healthcare , education and the economy in what he referred to as a " young democracy " emerging from years of tyranny .

the fare program includes advertizing spot broadcasts at every euro 2008 game , pitch-side boards , and activities to encourage intercultural exchanges between fans .
but after the weekend 's violence , it remains to be seen whether these measures are enough to tackle a problem that world soccer is finding hard to shake off .
the aims of the fare campaign stand in stark contrast to the realities presented on sunday in which a minority of fans were heard shouting nazi slogans at polish supporters .
uefa rhetoric on the outbreak suggested the soccer body had accepted that violence is always a possibility at high-stakes soccer matches .
" sensitive matches are dotted around the map of austria and switzerland , you can turn anything into a sensitive match if you think twice about it , " a uefa spokesperson told news agency skysports .
" we are not particularly worried about a single episode .
we have a global concept we apply , match by match and city by city .
it is well rehearsed and we hope also for every match it will work . "
danny lynch , spokesperson for anti-racism organization kick it out , which is involved in the fare euro 2008 campaign , said there would always be a minority who use soccer as a vehicle for disruption .
" the events on sunday were carried out by people who have no interest in -lrb- harmonious and respectful ways -rrb- whatsoever .
these far-right groups with links to nazi organizations … thrive on disorder and disruption . "
switzerland prepares for the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and austrian police march off violent fans in klagenfurt in switzerland , attempts to pre-empt violence included written letters to 300 known soccer thugs around europe , warning them that violence at euro 2008 would not be tolerated .
the swiss authorities also converted part of geneva 's palexpo convention center into a temporary detainment hall for soccer thugs and allocated $ 61 million for security at the tournament uefa also shelled out money to battle discrimination at euro 2008 , with over 300,000 euros going toward the fare unite against racism campaign .
despite the vast sums spent on match security and anti-discrimination campaigns , ongoing incidents of soccer violence persist across europe at both domestic and international levels of the game .
" in the uk we 've seen a decrease generally in soccer violence , but at the same time you look at the uefa cup final when glasgow supporters were fighting with police , " said lynch .
" in italy fans are fighting amongst each other .
there are still fans that just go out to fight . "
the problem continues bildunterschrift : german hooligans continue from where they left off in 2006 although kick it out holds hopes that one day soccer can be violence-and-racism-free , danny lynch admits that such problems will likely exist in one form or another for some time to come .
" soccer is unique in many ways , but for 90 minutes there are 30,000 people sat around a field in a situation that they ordinarily would n't be in .
this is the excuse that these people use to have a fight , " he said .
" if you look at the english game 20 years ago , fighting on the terraces was a common event .
now , we do n't see that .
what we do see is a new style of racist abuse : anti-semitism , islamophobia , homophobia .
" to say that -lrb- general soccer violence -rrb- will be stamped out in entirety is difficult , but it seems to be filtering out .
the one thing about the euro championship is that it 's one of the only times players from clubs around europe can come together to play each other .
we need to take the goodness of that and the fact that soccer is for everyone and focus on keeping it . " darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fare program includes advertizing spot broadcasts at every euro 2008 game , pitch-side boards , and activities to encourage intercultural exchanges between fans .
but after the weekend 's violence , it remains to be seen whether these measures are enough to tackle a problem that world soccer is finding hard to shake off .
the aims of the fare campaign stand in stark contrast to the realities presented on sunday in which a minority of fans were heard shouting nazi slogans at polish supporters .
uefa rhetoric on the outbreak suggested the soccer body had accepted that violence is always a possibility at high-stakes soccer matches .
" sensitive matches are dotted around the map of austria and switzerland , you can turn anything into a sensitive match if you think twice about it , " a uefa spokesperson told news agency skysports .
" we are not particularly worried about a single episode .
we have a global concept we apply , match by match and city by city .
it is well rehearsed and we hope also for every match it will work . "
danny lynch , spokesperson for anti-racism organization kick it out , which is involved in the fare euro 2008 campaign , said there would always be a minority who use soccer as a vehicle for disruption .

the swiss authorities also converted part of geneva 's palexpo convention center into a temporary detainment hall for soccer thugs and allocated $ 61 million for security at the tournament uefa also shelled out money to battle discrimination at euro 2008 , with over 300,000 euros going toward the fare unite against racism campaign .
despite the vast sums spent on match security and anti-discrimination campaigns , ongoing incidents of soccer violence persist across europe at both domestic and international levels of the game .
" in the uk we 've seen a decrease generally in soccer violence , but at the same time you look at the uefa cup final when glasgow supporters were fighting with police , " said lynch .
" in italy fans are fighting amongst each other .
there are still fans that just go out to fight . "
the problem continues bildunterschrift : german hooligans continue from where they left off in 2006 although kick it out holds hopes that one day soccer can be violence-and-racism-free , danny lynch admits that such problems will likely exist in one form or another for some time to come .

despite the vast sums spent on match security and anti-discrimination campaigns , ongoing incidents of soccer violence persist across europe at both domestic and international levels of the game .
" in the uk we 've seen a decrease generally in soccer violence , but at the same time you look at the uefa cup final when glasgow supporters were fighting with police , " said lynch .

there are still fans that just go out to fight . "

" soccer is unique in many ways , but for 90 minutes there are 30,000 people sat around a field in a situation that they ordinarily would n't be in .
this is the excuse that these people use to have a fight , " he said .
" if you look at the english game 20 years ago , fighting on the terraces was a common event .
now , we do n't see that .
what we do see is a new style of racist abuse : anti-semitism , islamophobia , homophobia .
" to say that -lrb- general soccer violence -rrb- will be stamped out in entirety is difficult , but it seems to be filtering out .
the one thing about the euro championship is that it 's one of the only times players from clubs around europe can come together to play each other .
we need to take the goodness of that and the fact that soccer is for everyone and focus on keeping it . " darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all options are on the table , " bush warned at a press conference after meeting merkel north of berlin at the end of his last visit to germany before leaving office .
the us preferred a diplomatic solution by working with its partners , bush said .
the five permanent members of the un security council and germany are engaged in efforts to persuade tehran to change course .
there was " a better way forward than isolation " for iran , he said , but he cautioned there could be additional un sanctions on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressuring iran leader ahmadinejad is on bush 's agenda merkel stressed germany 's preference for a diplomatic solution to the impasse , but she warned further sanctions could be applied .
merkel wants better implementation of sanctions " i believe diplomatic pressure has already taken effect , " she said .
merkel called for sanctions already passed by the security council to be better implemented , saying that she preferred the un route as this included russia and china , making sanctions more effective .
this did not exclude further action from the european union , particularly in the banking sector , merkel said .
the two leaders agreed on the need to push forward with the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks , noting that agricultural prices were becoming a crucial issue for developing countries .
bush spoke out against trade protectionism , and merkel highlighted the need for a transatlantic economic partnership - a theme she pressed under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- last year .
cooperation was particularly needed in setting standards for biofuels , merkel said in response to concerns that growing crops for conversion to fuels is resulting in higher food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is pushing for more german military in afghanistan on climate change , bush again stressed the need for the major carbon dioxide emitters among developing countries to be included in efforts to halt global warming .
merkel agreed that countries like india and china needed to be included in climate talks , saying that the german initiative in this regard at last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm would be continued in japan next month .
" we need a global agreement under the united nations , " she said .
bush regrets tone in iraq the two leaders also discussed afghanistan , with bush noting progress in healthcare , education and the economy in what he referred to as a " young democracy " emerging from years of tyranny .
bush was asked whether he regretted the iraq war , in the light of an interview with the times of london , published wednesday , june 11 , that indicated he regretted his rhetoric during the war .
" no i do n't regret it all .
but i could have used better rhetoric , " bush said .
" the decision to remove saddam hussein was the right decision . "
german press negative on visit german commentators noted that the bush visit was remarkable for the complete lack of public protest .
german political and press comment on the 20-hour visit - bush arrived from an eu-us summit in slovenia tuesday evening - was overwhelmingly negative .
" i wo n't miss george w. bush , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's conservative parliamentary bloc , told berlin regional public radio .
ulrich klose , a spokesman for germany 's other main party , the social democrats , the junior partner in merkel 's broad coalition , criticized bush 's foreign policy as " confrontational , " saying this had damaged the standing of the us in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel returned hospitality extended in crawford , texas even merkel , who has maintained friendly personal relations with the president throughout , looked ahead to the post-bush era that begins in january .
merkel looks to new chapter " this is his last european trip .
a new period will then begin , " she said .
bush arrived on his farewell visit to germany tuesday from the eu-us summit in brdo , slovenia to spend the night at schloss meseberg , the baroque palace north of the capital that the german government uses as a guesthouse .
from berlin , the president flew to rome , where apart from prime minister silvio berlusconi , he was to meet pope benedict xvi .

but the german car industry has welcomed an alternative german-franco deal as " an acceptable compromise . " the compromise , which trades carbon dioxide emissions efficiency for the use of green technologies , was reached on monday , june 9 , and received a cautiously positive reception from the bloc .
" we welcome the convergence of views between members which have big car industries but it 's a discussion that takes place within the council , with all members , " said european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj .
on december 19 , the commission proposed rules limiting the average co2 emissions of all new cars in europe to 130 grams per kilometer driven by the year 2012 - the 2006 european average was 160 grams per kilometer .
that drew criticism from german chancellor angela merkel and german carmakers .
but in consultations with french president nicolas sarkozy , a compromise was put forth whereby auto manufacturers could receive 8 kilograms per kilometer in " green credits " for using environmentally friendly technologies such as solar power .
carmakers mollified bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy saw eye to eye on the alternative co2 proposal the german-french proposal represented " a clear improvement on a proposition by the european commission , " matthias wissmann , head of the german automobile association vda , told dpa news agency .
bdi confederation of german industry spokesman werner schnappauf called the deal an " acceptable compromise , " paying tribute to merkel for " forcefully representing " the german car industry .
" not everything is clear , " added ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a german car specialist .
" but the solution is softer .
the targets will be easier to reach . "
the german car industry is fearful that tough emission targets could disproportionately penalize luxury cars manufacturers like daimler , bmw and audi with their relatively high fuel consumption and emissions and favor french and italian makers of economy cars .
merkel insists the limit should apply across the range for each carmaker , leaving carmakers the possibility of continuing to introduce high-emission luxury models , so long as they compensate by making low-emission models .
environmentalists angered but germany 's environmentalist party , the greens , were predictably less than happy about the commission 's original proposal potentially being watered down .
german media quoted green parliamentary co-leader renate kuenast as saying that merkel had " once again signed off on all of the german auto manufacturers ' propositions . "
the franco-german agreement " meant nothing good for climate protection , " she added .
but nothing firm has been decided .

" in an interview published in british daily newspaper the times , bush said his stance over iraq had made the world believe that he was a " guy really anxious for war . "
his use of phrases such as " bring them on " and " dead or alive " had indicated to people that " i was , you know , not a man of peace , " bush said .

bush has been widely accused of pressing for military intervention in iraq from shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks , despite little or no evidence of a link with the " 9/11 " hijackers .

but the croats have lots of players who ply their trade in the bundesliga .
and a decade ago , the croatian national team proved it could -lrb- man- -rrb- handle the germans . when the members of those two national squads take the pitch on thursday , june 12 in klagenfurt , those with keen memories might be thinking about the past .
in the latter half of the 1990s , the two sides became minor rivals after meeting twice in the space of two years in the quarter-finals of international tournaments .
one person who remembers those encounters very well is germany 's team manager oliver bierhoff , who played on both of those german teams .
it 's hardly surprising then that bierhoff has drawn parallels between the current squad and the one that beat the croats 2-1 in euro 1996 in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff wants germany to think of 1996 " we work very precisely - that 's one of the similarities - but in 1996 we had a lot of experienced players who had won major titles with their clubs and country , " the former striker told the online edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" the current team is a bit more hungry for and curious about what it 's like to win than was the case in 1996 , " bierhoff said .
that game was the first time germany had played post-yugoslavian croatia in a match that counted .
germany went on to win euro 96 , their last major title , thanks to a golden goal by bierhoff .
french fiasco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suker and croatia punished lothar matthaeus and germany in 1998 but two years later , at the 1998 world cup in france , the croats got revenge - and how .
after defender christian woerns was sent off in first half , croatia made a meal of their opponents , winning 3-0 .
the man of the match was croatian striker davor suker , who scored one goal and provoked the foul that left the germans shorthanded .
it was germany 's worst world cup defeat in 44 years and cost coach berti vogts , who had masterminded the 1996 euro win , his job .
" i thought it would be a one-goal game , " vogts said immediately after the debacle .
croatia lost to eventual winners france in the semis and came in third - that 's still the best-ever result for the team , which has only existed in its current form since 1990 .
intimate acquaintances bildunterschrift : croatia 's niko kovac , l , played 15 years in the bundesliga whether the players on thursday know their history is one thing .
what 's beyond doubt is that they know each other .
seven members of the croatian squad play or have played extensively in the german bundesliga .
five of them started in croatia 's lackluster 1-0 opening win against austria .
so how do they reckon their chances ?
" if we play like we did the second half -lrb- against austria -rrb- , we 'll have huge problems versus germany , " defender josip simunic , who plays for hertha berlin , cautioned after that first match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and his brother robert also knows germany inside and out but midfielder niko kovac , who did long stints at hertha , leverkusen and hamburg , has been more optimistic .
" against austria , we had enormous psychological pressure , which paralyzed us for a while , " kovac said .
" we had to win .
now we can and will play much more freely . "
but the pressure wo n't be as extreme on thursday as in either match from the 1990s .
while a win would send either croatia or germany through to the quarterfinals , both teams would stay alive in the group stage , even if they lose . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the croats have lots of players who ply their trade in the bundesliga .
and a decade ago , the croatian national team proved it could -lrb- man- -rrb- handle the germans . when the members of those two national squads take the pitch on thursday , june 12 in klagenfurt , those with keen memories might be thinking about the past .
in the latter half of the 1990s , the two sides became minor rivals after meeting twice in the space of two years in the quarter-finals of international tournaments .
one person who remembers those encounters very well is germany 's team manager oliver bierhoff , who played on both of those german teams .
it 's hardly surprising then that bierhoff has drawn parallels between the current squad and the one that beat the croats 2-1 in euro 1996 in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff wants germany to think of 1996 " we work very precisely - that 's one of the similarities - but in 1996 we had a lot of experienced players who had won major titles with their clubs and country , " the former striker told the online edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" the current team is a bit more hungry for and curious about what it 's like to win than was the case in 1996 , " bierhoff said .
that game was the first time germany had played post-yugoslavian croatia in a match that counted .
germany went on to win euro 96 , their last major title , thanks to a golden goal by bierhoff .
french fiasco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suker and croatia punished lothar matthaeus and germany in 1998 but two years later , at the 1998 world cup in france , the croats got revenge - and how .
after defender christian woerns was sent off in first half , croatia made a meal of their opponents , winning 3-0 .
the man of the match was croatian striker davor suker , who scored one goal and provoked the foul that left the germans shorthanded .
it was germany 's worst world cup defeat in 44 years and cost coach berti vogts , who had masterminded the 1996 euro win , his job .
" i thought it would be a one-goal game , " vogts said immediately after the debacle .
croatia lost to eventual winners france in the semis and came in third - that 's still the best-ever result for the team , which has only existed in its current form since 1990 .
intimate acquaintances bildunterschrift : croatia 's niko kovac , l , played 15 years in the bundesliga whether the players on thursday know their history is one thing .
what 's beyond doubt is that they know each other .
seven members of the croatian squad play or have played extensively in the german bundesliga .
five of them started in croatia 's lackluster 1-0 opening win against austria .
so how do they reckon their chances ?
" if we play like we did the second half -lrb- against austria -rrb- , we 'll have huge problems versus germany , " defender josip simunic , who plays for hertha berlin , cautioned after that first match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and his brother robert also knows germany inside and out but midfielder niko kovac , who did long stints at hertha , leverkusen and hamburg , has been more optimistic .

the greeks played their typical conservative game - this time it did n't work . the greeks under german coach otto rehhagel won euro 2004 by disrupting opponents ' play and waiting for mistakes , and that was exactly the way they started their 2008 campaign .
spectators in salzburg 's wals-siezenheim stadium were already booing after ten minutes , as it became clear just how much of a slog this match would be .
the lone highlight of the first half came in the 34th minute , when swedish striker zlatan ibrahimovic head narrowly over the crossbar with his back to the goal .
the second half initially brought little improvement - with the greeks almost taking an undeserved lead in the 66th minute after swedish defender petter hansson nearly headed an ill-advised clearance into his own goal .
six decisive minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece gave their supporters no reason to cheer but one minute later , with a goalless draw looking inevitable , sweden had a moment of inspiration .
ibrahimovich used a combination with strike partner henrik larsson to open up space around 16 meters from goal , and he fired a rocket into the upper right-hand corner of the net .
it was sweden 's first shot on goal in the entire match - and simultaneously the game winner .
greece , who had not conceded a goal in the european championship for more than 420 minutes , were forced to emerge from their defensive shell , but they failed to create any clear chances .
instead , in the 72nd minute , larsson maneuvered himself into a 1-on-1 situation against greek keeper antonis nikopolidis .
bildunterschrift : sweden 's second goal was a bit of football slapstick larsson 's shot was dismal , but the greeks failed to clear the ball , and hansson , who had almost been the goat of the match six minutes earlier , got just enough leg on it to complete the scoring .

" all options are on the table , " bush warned at a press conference after meeting merkel north of berlin at the end of his last visit to germany before leaving office .
the us preferred a diplomatic solution by working with its partners , bush said .
the five permanent members of the un security council and germany are engaged in efforts to persuade tehran to change course .
there was " a better way forward than isolation " for iran , he said , but he cautioned there could be additional un sanctions on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressuring iran leader ahmadinejad is on bush 's agenda merkel stressed germany 's preference for a diplomatic solution to the impasse , but she warned further sanctions could be applied .
merkel wants better implementation of sanctions " i believe diplomatic pressure has already taken effect , " she said .
merkel called for sanctions already passed by the security council to be better implemented , saying that she preferred the un route as this included russia and china , making sanctions more effective .
this did not exclude further action from the european union , particularly in the banking sector , merkel said .
the two leaders agreed on the need to push forward with the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks , noting that agricultural prices were becoming a crucial issue for developing countries .
bush spoke out against trade protectionism , and merkel highlighted the need for a transatlantic economic partnership - a theme she pressed under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- last year .
cooperation was particularly needed in setting standards for biofuels , merkel said in response to concerns that growing crops for conversion to fuels is resulting in higher food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is pushing for more german military in afghanistan on climate change , bush again stressed the need for the major carbon dioxide emitters among developing countries to be included in efforts to halt global warming .
merkel agreed that countries like india and china needed to be included in climate talks , saying that the german initiative in this regard at last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm would be continued in japan next month .
" we need a global agreement under the united nations , " she said .
bush regrets tone in iraq the two leaders also discussed afghanistan , with bush noting progress in healthcare , education and the economy in what he referred to as a " young democracy " emerging from years of tyranny .
bush was asked whether he regretted the iraq war , in the light of an interview with the times of london , published wednesday , june 11 , that indicated he regretted his rhetoric during the war .
" no i do n't regret it all .
but i could have used better rhetoric , " bush said .
" the decision to remove saddam hussein was the right decision . "
german press negative on visit german commentators noted that the bush visit was remarkable for the complete lack of public protest .
german political and press comment on the 20-hour visit - bush arrived from an eu-us summit in slovenia tuesday evening - was overwhelmingly negative .
" i wo n't miss george w. bush , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's conservative parliamentary bloc , told berlin regional public radio .
ulrich klose , a spokesman for germany 's other main party , the social democrats , the junior partner in merkel 's broad coalition , criticized bush 's foreign policy as " confrontational , " saying this had damaged the standing of the us in the world .

with germany celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the introduction of its social-market economy and the d-mark this june , merkel was also at pains to emphasize that these events did not undermine the legitimacy of the existing order .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the ft .
" but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .
my patriotic sensitivity tells me i must stand by these companies in tough times .
we must lead them onto the path of virtue , no question , but one should not condemn them en masse . "
one allegation after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender of the business faith : angela merkel just under two weeks ago , deutsche telekom ceo called in prosecutors to investigate allegations that the company had engaged a data-mining firm to track thousands of calls between top executives and journalists .
snooping accusations have subsequently been levelled in the media against a number of other firms , such as lufthansa and deutsche bahn .
this comes after investigations into bribery at siemens and corruption at volkswagen .

but the opposition and migrant organizations have criticised the point of the exercise . the multiple choice test will cover such areas as germany 's political system and society , as well as german history .
the 33 questions will be picked at random from a list of just over 300 .
would-be citizens will have to answer just over half of them correctly .
with the number of people applying for german citizenship in steady declining over recent years , some critics have disputed the necessity of the examination .
others have questioned the sense of something that simply rewards rote learning .
the right approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states of bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg and hesse have pressed for the test green party parliamentarian josef winkler described the test as a " spurious solution for a spurious problem " in an interview with the financial times deutschland .
the left party vice chairwoman halina wawzyniak also described it as " superfluous " .
she called for a comprehensive overhaul of citizenship laws and the relaxation of rules on dual citizenship .
the free democrats ' integration expert sibylle laurischk criticized the content of the test .
" anyone who can learn stuff well off by heart can easily pass a formulaic test of this nature , " she told the ftd .
she called for a flexible approach when evaluating test results , stressing the greater importance of having a good command of the german language .
the chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat , has described the test as a " procedure to select between the educated and the uneducated " .
he said that lower-class migrants would be unable to pass .
in an interview with the epd news agency , kolat accused germany of creating more and more new hurdles to obtaining citizenship , causing migrants , as a result , to increasingly become disaffected .
set to increase alienation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say language classes are more important than swotting for a rote test he said the test reinforced " the feeling of being a foreigner " and predicted a further drop in the number of people applying for citizenship .
an interior ministry spokesman defended the examination .
he said that citizens had both rights and duties .
citizenship tests exist in a number of other european union countries , including the uk and the netherlands .
but organizational difficulties could still stand in the way of the punctual launch of the test .
the questions are still being worked on and are not due to be published until the cabinet have approved them in late july or early august .
ulrich aengenvoort , the director of germany 's volkshochschulen -lrb- vhs -rrb- , the educational institutes charged with conducting the test , conceded that the timetable was tight .
however , he said he was confident that the vhs would cope . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with germany celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the introduction of its social-market economy and the d-mark this june , merkel was also at pains to emphasize that these events did not undermine the legitimacy of the existing order .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the ft .
" but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .
my patriotic sensitivity tells me i must stand by these companies in tough times .
we must lead them onto the path of virtue , no question , but one should not condemn them en masse . "
one allegation after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender of the business faith : angela merkel just under two weeks ago , deutsche telekom ceo called in prosecutors to investigate allegations that the company had engaged a data-mining firm to track thousands of calls between top executives and journalists .
snooping accusations have subsequently been levelled in the media against a number of other firms , such as lufthansa and deutsche bahn .
this comes after investigations into bribery at siemens and corruption at volkswagen .
several former bosses at europe 's biggest carmaker have been prosecuted after it emerged in 2005 that a slush fund was set up to pay for holidays and prostitutes .
these scandals and allegations of tax evasion by germany 's high earners earlier this year have stirred up widespread resentment towards the country 's business elite . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland goes to the polls thursday in the european union 's only referendum on the lisbon treaty .
eu and irish leaders are holding their collective breath as they hope to avoid disaster . with a traditional eve-of-vote news blackout in operation in ireland on wednesday , the country 's three leading political parties , who have pushed hard for a yes vote , were cautious ahead of the referendum .
as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .
he added that europe would go back to an uncertain situation if the lisbon treaty was defeated .
cowen emphasized that all of ireland 's concerns had been catered to in the treaty , rte reported .
he said it was his deeply held belief that the lisbon treaty was crucial to ireland 's future prospects .
he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .
" the most recent numbers are fairly positive , " stubb said .
the irish referendum topped the agenda of the talks , which also centered on the situation in the middle east , relations with moscow and baltic sea issues . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland goes to the polls thursday in the european union 's only referendum on the lisbon treaty .
eu and irish leaders are holding their collective breath as they hope to avoid disaster . with a traditional eve-of-vote news blackout in operation in ireland on wednesday , the country 's three leading political parties , who have pushed hard for a yes vote , were cautious ahead of the referendum .
as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .
he added that europe would go back to an uncertain situation if the lisbon treaty was defeated .
cowen emphasized that all of ireland 's concerns had been catered to in the treaty , rte reported .
he said it was his deeply held belief that the lisbon treaty was crucial to ireland 's future prospects .
he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .
" the most recent numbers are fairly positive , " stubb said .

ireland goes to the polls thursday in the european union 's only referendum on the lisbon treaty .
eu and irish leaders are holding their collective breath as they hope to avoid disaster . with a traditional eve-of-vote news blackout in operation in ireland on wednesday , the country 's three leading political parties , who have pushed hard for a yes vote , were cautious ahead of the referendum .
as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .
he added that europe would go back to an uncertain situation if the lisbon treaty was defeated .
cowen emphasized that all of ireland 's concerns had been catered to in the treaty , rte reported .
he said it was his deeply held belief that the lisbon treaty was crucial to ireland 's future prospects .
he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .
" the most recent numbers are fairly positive , " stubb said .
the irish referendum topped the agenda of the talks , which also centered on the situation in the middle east , relations with moscow and baltic sea issues . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with germany celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the introduction of its social-market economy and the d-mark this june , merkel was also at pains to emphasize that these events did not undermine the legitimacy of the existing order .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the ft .
" but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .
my patriotic sensitivity tells me i must stand by these companies in tough times .
we must lead them onto the path of virtue , no question , but one should not condemn them en masse . "
one allegation after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender of the business faith : angela merkel just under two weeks ago , deutsche telekom ceo called in prosecutors to investigate allegations that the company had engaged a data-mining firm to track thousands of calls between top executives and journalists .
snooping accusations have subsequently been levelled in the media against a number of other firms , such as lufthansa and deutsche bahn .
this comes after investigations into bribery at siemens and corruption at volkswagen .
several former bosses at europe 's biggest carmaker have been prosecuted after it emerged in 2005 that a slush fund was set up to pay for holidays and prostitutes .
these scandals and allegations of tax evasion by germany 's high earners earlier this year have stirred up widespread resentment towards the country 's business elite . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us preferred a diplomatic solution by working with its partners , bush said .

merkel called for sanctions already passed by the security council to be better implemented , saying that she preferred the un route as this included russia and china , making sanctions more effective .
this did not exclude further action from the european union , particularly in the banking sector , merkel said .
the two leaders agreed on the need to push forward with the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks , noting that agricultural prices were becoming a crucial issue for developing countries .
bush spoke out against trade protectionism , and merkel highlighted the need for a transatlantic economic partnership - a theme she pressed under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- last year .

" we need a global agreement under the united nations , " she said .
bush regrets tone in iraq the two leaders also discussed afghanistan , with bush noting progress in healthcare , education and the economy in what he referred to as a " young democracy " emerging from years of tyranny .

the greeks played their typical conservative game - this time it did n't work . the greeks under german coach otto rehhagel won euro 2004 by disrupting opponents ' play and waiting for mistakes , and that was exactly the way they started their 2008 campaign .
spectators in salzburg 's wals-siezenheim stadium were already booing after ten minutes , as it became clear just how much of a slog this match would be .
the lone highlight of the first half came in the 34th minute , when swedish striker zlatan ibrahimovic head narrowly over the crossbar with his back to the goal .
the second half initially brought little improvement - with the greeks almost taking an undeserved lead in the 66th minute after swedish defender petter hansson nearly headed an ill-advised clearance into his own goal .
six decisive minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece gave their supporters no reason to cheer but one minute later , with a goalless draw looking inevitable , sweden had a moment of inspiration .
ibrahimovich used a combination with strike partner henrik larsson to open up space around 16 meters from goal , and he fired a rocket into the upper right-hand corner of the net .
it was sweden 's first shot on goal in the entire match - and simultaneously the game winner .
greece , who had not conceded a goal in the european championship for more than 420 minutes , were forced to emerge from their defensive shell , but they failed to create any clear chances .
instead , in the 72nd minute , larsson maneuvered himself into a 1-on-1 situation against greek keeper antonis nikopolidis .
bildunterschrift : sweden 's second goal was a bit of football slapstick larsson 's shot was dismal , but the greeks failed to clear the ball , and hansson , who had almost been the goat of the match six minutes earlier , got just enough leg on it to complete the scoring .
" we do want to score goals as well but the truth is we do n't score many , " said rehhagel after the match in defense of his conservative tactics .
sweden now face a far tougher test against spain on saturday , while the greeks try to make up for their poor start against russia . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the opposition and migrant organizations have criticised the point of the exercise . the multiple choice test will cover such areas as germany 's political system and society , as well as german history .
the 33 questions will be picked at random from a list of just over 300 .
would-be citizens will have to answer just over half of them correctly .
with the number of people applying for german citizenship in steady declining over recent years , some critics have disputed the necessity of the examination .
others have questioned the sense of something that simply rewards rote learning .
the right approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states of bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg and hesse have pressed for the test green party parliamentarian josef winkler described the test as a " spurious solution for a spurious problem " in an interview with the financial times deutschland .
the left party vice chairwoman halina wawzyniak also described it as " superfluous " .
she called for a comprehensive overhaul of citizenship laws and the relaxation of rules on dual citizenship .

one person who remembers those encounters very well is germany 's team manager oliver bierhoff , who played on both of those german teams .

but the croats have lots of players who ply their trade in the bundesliga .
and a decade ago , the croatian national team proved it could -lrb- man- -rrb- handle the germans . when the members of those two national squads take the pitch on thursday , june 12 in klagenfurt , those with keen memories might be thinking about the past .
in the latter half of the 1990s , the two sides became minor rivals after meeting twice in the space of two years in the quarter-finals of international tournaments .
one person who remembers those encounters very well is germany 's team manager oliver bierhoff , who played on both of those german teams .
it 's hardly surprising then that bierhoff has drawn parallels between the current squad and the one that beat the croats 2-1 in euro 1996 in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff wants germany to think of 1996 " we work very precisely - that 's one of the similarities - but in 1996 we had a lot of experienced players who had won major titles with their clubs and country , " the former striker told the online edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" the current team is a bit more hungry for and curious about what it 's like to win than was the case in 1996 , " bierhoff said .
that game was the first time germany had played post-yugoslavian croatia in a match that counted .
germany went on to win euro 96 , their last major title , thanks to a golden goal by bierhoff .
french fiasco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suker and croatia punished lothar matthaeus and germany in 1998 but two years later , at the 1998 world cup in france , the croats got revenge - and how .
after defender christian woerns was sent off in first half , croatia made a meal of their opponents , winning 3-0 .
the man of the match was croatian striker davor suker , who scored one goal and provoked the foul that left the germans shorthanded .
it was germany 's worst world cup defeat in 44 years and cost coach berti vogts , who had masterminded the 1996 euro win , his job .
" i thought it would be a one-goal game , " vogts said immediately after the debacle .
croatia lost to eventual winners france in the semis and came in third - that 's still the best-ever result for the team , which has only existed in its current form since 1990 .
intimate acquaintances bildunterschrift : croatia 's niko kovac , l , played 15 years in the bundesliga whether the players on thursday know their history is one thing .
what 's beyond doubt is that they know each other .
seven members of the croatian squad play or have played extensively in the german bundesliga .
five of them started in croatia 's lackluster 1-0 opening win against austria .
so how do they reckon their chances ?
" if we play like we did the second half -lrb- against austria -rrb- , we 'll have huge problems versus germany , " defender josip simunic , who plays for hertha berlin , cautioned after that first match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and his brother robert also knows germany inside and out but midfielder niko kovac , who did long stints at hertha , leverkusen and hamburg , has been more optimistic .
" against austria , we had enormous psychological pressure , which paralyzed us for a while , " kovac said .
" we had to win .
now we can and will play much more freely . "
but the pressure wo n't be as extreme on thursday as in either match from the 1990s .
while a win would send either croatia or germany through to the quarterfinals , both teams would stay alive in the group stage , even if they lose . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland goes to the polls thursday in the european union 's only referendum on the lisbon treaty .
eu and irish leaders are holding their collective breath as they hope to avoid disaster . with a traditional eve-of-vote news blackout in operation in ireland on wednesday , the country 's three leading political parties , who have pushed hard for a yes vote , were cautious ahead of the referendum .
as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .
he added that europe would go back to an uncertain situation if the lisbon treaty was defeated .
cowen emphasized that all of ireland 's concerns had been catered to in the treaty , rte reported .
he said it was his deeply held belief that the lisbon treaty was crucial to ireland 's future prospects .
he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .

ireland goes to the polls thursday in the european union 's only referendum on the lisbon treaty .
eu and irish leaders are holding their collective breath as they hope to avoid disaster . with a traditional eve-of-vote news blackout in operation in ireland on wednesday , the country 's three leading political parties , who have pushed hard for a yes vote , were cautious ahead of the referendum .
as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .
he added that europe would go back to an uncertain situation if the lisbon treaty was defeated .
cowen emphasized that all of ireland 's concerns had been catered to in the treaty , rte reported .
he said it was his deeply held belief that the lisbon treaty was crucial to ireland 's future prospects .
he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 11.06.2008 after merkel meeting , bush says iran options open großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is one of bush 's favorite leaders in europe us president george w. bush and german chancellor angela merkel restated that iran should halt its uranium enrichment program and open its nuclear program for inspection . " all options are on the table , " bush warned at a press conference after meeting merkel north of berlin at the end of his last visit to germany before leaving office .
the us preferred a diplomatic solution by working with its partners , bush said .
the five permanent members of the un security council and germany are engaged in efforts to persuade tehran to change course .
there was " a better way forward than isolation " for iran , he said , but he cautioned there could be additional un sanctions on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressuring iran leader ahmadinejad is on bush 's agenda merkel stressed germany 's preference for a diplomatic solution to the impasse , but she warned further sanctions could be applied .
merkel wants better implementation of sanctions " i believe diplomatic pressure has already taken effect , " she said .
merkel called for sanctions already passed by the security council to be better implemented , saying that she preferred the un route as this included russia and china , making sanctions more effective .
this did not exclude further action from the european union , particularly in the banking sector , merkel said .
the two leaders agreed on the need to push forward with the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks , noting that agricultural prices were becoming a crucial issue for developing countries .
bush spoke out against trade protectionism , and merkel highlighted the need for a transatlantic economic partnership - a theme she pressed under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- last year .
cooperation was particularly needed in setting standards for biofuels , merkel said in response to concerns that growing crops for conversion to fuels is resulting in higher food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is pushing for more german military in afghanistan on climate change , bush again stressed the need for the major carbon dioxide emitters among developing countries to be included in efforts to halt global warming .
merkel agreed that countries like india and china needed to be included in climate talks , saying that the german initiative in this regard at last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm would be continued in japan next month .
" we need a global agreement under the united nations , " she said .
bush regrets tone in iraq the two leaders also discussed afghanistan , with bush noting progress in healthcare , education and the economy in what he referred to as a " young democracy " emerging from years of tyranny .
bush was asked whether he regretted the iraq war , in the light of an interview with the times of london , published wednesday , june 11 , that indicated he regretted his rhetoric during the war .
" no i do n't regret it all .
but i could have used better rhetoric , " bush said .
" the decision to remove saddam hussein was the right decision . "
german press negative on visit german commentators noted that the bush visit was remarkable for the complete lack of public protest .
german political and press comment on the 20-hour visit - bush arrived from an eu-us summit in slovenia tuesday evening - was overwhelmingly negative .
" i wo n't miss george w. bush , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's conservative parliamentary bloc , told berlin regional public radio .
ulrich klose , a spokesman for germany 's other main party , the social democrats , the junior partner in merkel 's broad coalition , criticized bush 's foreign policy as " confrontational , " saying this had damaged the standing of the us in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel returned hospitality extended in crawford , texas even merkel , who has maintained friendly personal relations with the president throughout , looked ahead to the post-bush era that begins in january .
merkel looks to new chapter " this is his last european trip .
a new period will then begin , " she said .
bush arrived on his farewell visit to germany tuesday from the eu-us summit in brdo , slovenia to spend the night at schloss meseberg , the baroque palace north of the capital that the german government uses as a guesthouse .
from berlin , the president flew to rome , where apart from prime minister silvio berlusconi , he was to meet pope benedict xvi .
bush is to pay brief final visits to paris , london and belfast in northern ireland , before returning to the us . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fare program includes advertizing spot broadcasts at every euro 2008 game , pitch-side boards , and activities to encourage intercultural exchanges between fans .

the aims of the fare campaign stand in stark contrast to the realities presented on sunday in which a minority of fans were heard shouting nazi slogans at polish supporters .
uefa rhetoric on the outbreak suggested the soccer body had accepted that violence is always a possibility at high-stakes soccer matches .

the fare program includes advertizing spot broadcasts at every euro 2008 game , pitch-side boards , and activities to encourage intercultural exchanges between fans .
but after the weekend 's violence , it remains to be seen whether these measures are enough to tackle a problem that world soccer is finding hard to shake off .
the aims of the fare campaign stand in stark contrast to the realities presented on sunday in which a minority of fans were heard shouting nazi slogans at polish supporters .
uefa rhetoric on the outbreak suggested the soccer body had accepted that violence is always a possibility at high-stakes soccer matches .
" sensitive matches are dotted around the map of austria and switzerland , you can turn anything into a sensitive match if you think twice about it , " a uefa spokesperson told news agency skysports .
" we are not particularly worried about a single episode .
we have a global concept we apply , match by match and city by city .
it is well rehearsed and we hope also for every match it will work . "
danny lynch , spokesperson for anti-racism organization kick it out , which is involved in the fare euro 2008 campaign , said there would always be a minority who use soccer as a vehicle for disruption .

despite the vast sums spent on match security and anti-discrimination campaigns , ongoing incidents of soccer violence persist across europe at both domestic and international levels of the game .
" in the uk we 've seen a decrease generally in soccer violence , but at the same time you look at the uefa cup final when glasgow supporters were fighting with police , " said lynch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 11.06.2008 german carmakers welcome modified emissions target großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers worry tough emission limits could hurt luxury manufacturers like daimler as a country that manufactures lots of big cars , germany had the most to lose from eu plans to limit emissions .
but the german car industry has welcomed an alternative german-franco deal as " an acceptable compromise . " the compromise , which trades carbon dioxide emissions efficiency for the use of green technologies , was reached on monday , june 9 , and received a cautiously positive reception from the bloc .
" we welcome the convergence of views between members which have big car industries but it 's a discussion that takes place within the council , with all members , " said european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj .
on december 19 , the commission proposed rules limiting the average co2 emissions of all new cars in europe to 130 grams per kilometer driven by the year 2012 - the 2006 european average was 160 grams per kilometer .

" all options are on the table , " bush warned at a press conference after meeting merkel north of berlin at the end of his last visit to germany before leaving office .
the us preferred a diplomatic solution by working with its partners , bush said .

merkel called for sanctions already passed by the security council to be better implemented , saying that she preferred the un route as this included russia and china , making sanctions more effective .
this did not exclude further action from the european union , particularly in the banking sector , merkel said .
the two leaders agreed on the need to push forward with the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks , noting that agricultural prices were becoming a crucial issue for developing countries .

the greeks played their typical conservative game - this time it did n't work . the greeks under german coach otto rehhagel won euro 2004 by disrupting opponents ' play and waiting for mistakes , and that was exactly the way they started their 2008 campaign .
spectators in salzburg 's wals-siezenheim stadium were already booing after ten minutes , as it became clear just how much of a slog this match would be .
the lone highlight of the first half came in the 34th minute , when swedish striker zlatan ibrahimovic head narrowly over the crossbar with his back to the goal .
the second half initially brought little improvement - with the greeks almost taking an undeserved lead in the 66th minute after swedish defender petter hansson nearly headed an ill-advised clearance into his own goal .
six decisive minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece gave their supporters no reason to cheer but one minute later , with a goalless draw looking inevitable , sweden had a moment of inspiration .
ibrahimovich used a combination with strike partner henrik larsson to open up space around 16 meters from goal , and he fired a rocket into the upper right-hand corner of the net .
it was sweden 's first shot on goal in the entire match - and simultaneously the game winner .
greece , who had not conceded a goal in the european championship for more than 420 minutes , were forced to emerge from their defensive shell , but they failed to create any clear chances .
instead , in the 72nd minute , larsson maneuvered himself into a 1-on-1 situation against greek keeper antonis nikopolidis .
bildunterschrift : sweden 's second goal was a bit of football slapstick larsson 's shot was dismal , but the greeks failed to clear the ball , and hansson , who had almost been the goat of the match six minutes earlier , got just enough leg on it to complete the scoring .
" we do want to score goals as well but the truth is we do n't score many , " said rehhagel after the match in defense of his conservative tactics .

" in an interview published in british daily newspaper the times , bush said his stance over iraq had made the world believe that he was a " guy really anxious for war . "
his use of phrases such as " bring them on " and " dead or alive " had indicated to people that " i was , you know , not a man of peace , " bush said .

the us leader insisted that he had pressed hard for a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
bush calls diplomacy efforts an " untold story " " one of the untold stories of iraq is that we explored diplomacy a lot , " he said .
" we all wanted to solve this ' disclose , disarm , or face serious consequences ' in a diplomatic fashion .
after all , i went to the united nations security council , " he added .

some 400 members of the hells angels and 50 of the bandidos were present in muenster for the final day of the trial .
a strong police presence kept the two groups apart .
deeply involved in organized crime biker gangs including the bandidos and the hells angels , both of which have charters all over the world , have been involved in bloody feuds in recent years and are believed to be highly active in organized crime .
last month , the interior ministry in the southern state of bavaria warned the hells angels were extending their sphere of influence into southern germany .
the motorcycle group , which has been linked to organized crime in many countries , has long been established in northern europe .
the hells angels have in the past been linked to dealing in illegal drugs and arms and to prostitution , protection rackets and money-laundering .
the ministry said southern germany was of increasing interest to the gang because of drug routes running through south-eastern europe and the balkans .
in december , dutch prosecutors failed in their efforts to have the hells angels declared a criminal association after an amsterdam court ruled that confidential conversations between members and their lawyers had been bugged illegally . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in an interview published in british daily newspaper the times , bush said his stance over iraq had made the world believe that he was a " guy really anxious for war . "
his use of phrases such as " bring them on " and " dead or alive " had indicated to people that " i was , you know , not a man of peace , " bush said .
" i could have used a different tone " " look , i think that in retrospect , you know , i could have used a different tone , " he told the times .

bush has been widely accused of pressing for military intervention in iraq from shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks , despite little or no evidence of a link with the " 9/11 " hijackers .
the us leader insisted that he had pressed hard for a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
bush calls diplomacy efforts an " untold story " " one of the untold stories of iraq is that we explored diplomacy a lot , " he said .
" we all wanted to solve this ' disclose , disarm , or face serious consequences ' in a diplomatic fashion .
after all , i went to the united nations security council , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush declared combat over in 2003 bush said he was concerned that policies by democratic presidential hopeful barack obama might open divisions in western attitudes towards iran 's nuclear ambitions .
the world ought to work together and " keep focused , " bush told the paper .
bush predicts strategic accord with iraq meanwhile , in a question and answer session following a final state visit to german chancellor angela merkel , bush predicted washington and baghdad would work through rifts and reach a deal on the continued deployment of us forces in iraq .
" i think we 'll end up with a strategic agreement with iraq .
there 's all kinds of noise in their system and our system , " he said .

but the croats have lots of players who ply their trade in the bundesliga .
and a decade ago , the croatian national team proved it could -lrb- man- -rrb- handle the germans . when the members of those two national squads take the pitch on thursday , june 12 in klagenfurt , those with keen memories might be thinking about the past .
in the latter half of the 1990s , the two sides became minor rivals after meeting twice in the space of two years in the quarter-finals of international tournaments .
one person who remembers those encounters very well is germany 's team manager oliver bierhoff , who played on both of those german teams .
it 's hardly surprising then that bierhoff has drawn parallels between the current squad and the one that beat the croats 2-1 in euro 1996 in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff wants germany to think of 1996 " we work very precisely - that 's one of the similarities - but in 1996 we had a lot of experienced players who had won major titles with their clubs and country , " the former striker told the online edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" the current team is a bit more hungry for and curious about what it 's like to win than was the case in 1996 , " bierhoff said .
that game was the first time germany had played post-yugoslavian croatia in a match that counted .
germany went on to win euro 96 , their last major title , thanks to a golden goal by bierhoff .

after defender christian woerns was sent off in first half , croatia made a meal of their opponents , winning 3-0 .
the man of the match was croatian striker davor suker , who scored one goal and provoked the foul that left the germans shorthanded .
it was germany 's worst world cup defeat in 44 years and cost coach berti vogts , who had masterminded the 1996 euro win , his job .
" i thought it would be a one-goal game , " vogts said immediately after the debacle .
croatia lost to eventual winners france in the semis and came in third - that 's still the best-ever result for the team , which has only existed in its current form since 1990 .
intimate acquaintances bildunterschrift : croatia 's niko kovac , l , played 15 years in the bundesliga whether the players on thursday know their history is one thing .
what 's beyond doubt is that they know each other .
seven members of the croatian squad play or have played extensively in the german bundesliga .
five of them started in croatia 's lackluster 1-0 opening win against austria .
so how do they reckon their chances ?
" if we play like we did the second half -lrb- against austria -rrb- , we 'll have huge problems versus germany , " defender josip simunic , who plays for hertha berlin , cautioned after that first match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and his brother robert also knows germany inside and out but midfielder niko kovac , who did long stints at hertha , leverkusen and hamburg , has been more optimistic .

" we had to win .
now we can and will play much more freely . "

the greeks played their typical conservative game - this time it did n't work . the greeks under german coach otto rehhagel won euro 2004 by disrupting opponents ' play and waiting for mistakes , and that was exactly the way they started their 2008 campaign .
spectators in salzburg 's wals-siezenheim stadium were already booing after ten minutes , as it became clear just how much of a slog this match would be .
the lone highlight of the first half came in the 34th minute , when swedish striker zlatan ibrahimovic head narrowly over the crossbar with his back to the goal .
the second half initially brought little improvement - with the greeks almost taking an undeserved lead in the 66th minute after swedish defender petter hansson nearly headed an ill-advised clearance into his own goal .
six decisive minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece gave their supporters no reason to cheer but one minute later , with a goalless draw looking inevitable , sweden had a moment of inspiration .
ibrahimovich used a combination with strike partner henrik larsson to open up space around 16 meters from goal , and he fired a rocket into the upper right-hand corner of the net .
it was sweden 's first shot on goal in the entire match - and simultaneously the game winner .
greece , who had not conceded a goal in the european championship for more than 420 minutes , were forced to emerge from their defensive shell , but they failed to create any clear chances .
instead , in the 72nd minute , larsson maneuvered himself into a 1-on-1 situation against greek keeper antonis nikopolidis .
bildunterschrift : sweden 's second goal was a bit of football slapstick larsson 's shot was dismal , but the greeks failed to clear the ball , and hansson , who had almost been the goat of the match six minutes earlier , got just enough leg on it to complete the scoring .
" we do want to score goals as well but the truth is we do n't score many , " said rehhagel after the match in defense of his conservative tactics .

" the treaty has now been ratified by 17 member states .

the treaty is expected to get passed by greece 's parliament as both the ruling conservative government and main opposition socialist party are both in favor .

it also seeks to increase policy areas in which decisions could be made by majority votes rather than requiring unanimous approval . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fare program includes advertizing spot broadcasts at every euro 2008 game , pitch-side boards , and activities to encourage intercultural exchanges between fans .
but after the weekend 's violence , it remains to be seen whether these measures are enough to tackle a problem that world soccer is finding hard to shake off .
the aims of the fare campaign stand in stark contrast to the realities presented on sunday in which a minority of fans were heard shouting nazi slogans at polish supporters .
uefa rhetoric on the outbreak suggested the soccer body had accepted that violence is always a possibility at high-stakes soccer matches .
" sensitive matches are dotted around the map of austria and switzerland , you can turn anything into a sensitive match if you think twice about it , " a uefa spokesperson told news agency skysports .
" we are not particularly worried about a single episode .

the fare program includes advertizing spot broadcasts at every euro 2008 game , pitch-side boards , and activities to encourage intercultural exchanges between fans .
but after the weekend 's violence , it remains to be seen whether these measures are enough to tackle a problem that world soccer is finding hard to shake off .
the aims of the fare campaign stand in stark contrast to the realities presented on sunday in which a minority of fans were heard shouting nazi slogans at polish supporters .
uefa rhetoric on the outbreak suggested the soccer body had accepted that violence is always a possibility at high-stakes soccer matches .
" sensitive matches are dotted around the map of austria and switzerland , you can turn anything into a sensitive match if you think twice about it , " a uefa spokesperson told news agency skysports .
" we are not particularly worried about a single episode .
we have a global concept we apply , match by match and city by city .
it is well rehearsed and we hope also for every match it will work . "
danny lynch , spokesperson for anti-racism organization kick it out , which is involved in the fare euro 2008 campaign , said there would always be a minority who use soccer as a vehicle for disruption .
" the events on sunday were carried out by people who have no interest in -lrb- harmonious and respectful ways -rrb- whatsoever .
these far-right groups with links to nazi organizations … thrive on disorder and disruption . "
switzerland prepares for the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and austrian police march off violent fans in klagenfurt in switzerland , attempts to pre-empt violence included written letters to 300 known soccer thugs around europe , warning them that violence at euro 2008 would not be tolerated .
the swiss authorities also converted part of geneva 's palexpo convention center into a temporary detainment hall for soccer thugs and allocated $ 61 million for security at the tournament uefa also shelled out money to battle discrimination at euro 2008 , with over 300,000 euros going toward the fare unite against racism campaign .
despite the vast sums spent on match security and anti-discrimination campaigns , ongoing incidents of soccer violence persist across europe at both domestic and international levels of the game .
" in the uk we 've seen a decrease generally in soccer violence , but at the same time you look at the uefa cup final when glasgow supporters were fighting with police , " said lynch .
" in italy fans are fighting amongst each other .
there are still fans that just go out to fight . "
the problem continues bildunterschrift : german hooligans continue from where they left off in 2006 although kick it out holds hopes that one day soccer can be violence-and-racism-free , danny lynch admits that such problems will likely exist in one form or another for some time to come .
" soccer is unique in many ways , but for 90 minutes there are 30,000 people sat around a field in a situation that they ordinarily would n't be in .
this is the excuse that these people use to have a fight , " he said .
" if you look at the english game 20 years ago , fighting on the terraces was a common event .
now , we do n't see that .
what we do see is a new style of racist abuse : anti-semitism , islamophobia , homophobia .
" to say that -lrb- general soccer violence -rrb- will be stamped out in entirety is difficult , but it seems to be filtering out .
the one thing about the euro championship is that it 's one of the only times players from clubs around europe can come together to play each other .
we need to take the goodness of that and the fact that soccer is for everyone and focus on keeping it . " darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the opposition and migrant organizations have criticised the point of the exercise . the multiple choice test will cover such areas as germany 's political system and society , as well as german history .
the 33 questions will be picked at random from a list of just over 300 .
would-be citizens will have to answer just over half of them correctly .
with the number of people applying for german citizenship in steady declining over recent years , some critics have disputed the necessity of the examination .
others have questioned the sense of something that simply rewards rote learning .
the right approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states of bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg and hesse have pressed for the test green party parliamentarian josef winkler described the test as a " spurious solution for a spurious problem " in an interview with the financial times deutschland .
the left party vice chairwoman halina wawzyniak also described it as " superfluous " .
she called for a comprehensive overhaul of citizenship laws and the relaxation of rules on dual citizenship .
the free democrats ' integration expert sibylle laurischk criticized the content of the test .
" anyone who can learn stuff well off by heart can easily pass a formulaic test of this nature , " she told the ftd .
she called for a flexible approach when evaluating test results , stressing the greater importance of having a good command of the german language .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 11.06.2008 citizenship tests to become compulsory across germany in fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be citizens will have to go back to the classroom from september 1 onwards , anyone applying for german citizenship will first have to pass a citizenship test .
but the opposition and migrant organizations have criticised the point of the exercise . the multiple choice test will cover such areas as germany 's political system and society , as well as german history .
the 33 questions will be picked at random from a list of just over 300 .
would-be citizens will have to answer just over half of them correctly .
with the number of people applying for german citizenship in steady declining over recent years , some critics have disputed the necessity of the examination .
others have questioned the sense of something that simply rewards rote learning .
the right approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states of bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg and hesse have pressed for the test green party parliamentarian josef winkler described the test as a " spurious solution for a spurious problem " in an interview with the financial times deutschland .
the left party vice chairwoman halina wawzyniak also described it as " superfluous " .
she called for a comprehensive overhaul of citizenship laws and the relaxation of rules on dual citizenship .
the free democrats ' integration expert sibylle laurischk criticized the content of the test .
" anyone who can learn stuff well off by heart can easily pass a formulaic test of this nature , " she told the ftd .
she called for a flexible approach when evaluating test results , stressing the greater importance of having a good command of the german language .
the chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat , has described the test as a " procedure to select between the educated and the uneducated " .
he said that lower-class migrants would be unable to pass .
in an interview with the epd news agency , kolat accused germany of creating more and more new hurdles to obtaining citizenship , causing migrants , as a result , to increasingly become disaffected .
set to increase alienation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say language classes are more important than swotting for a rote test he said the test reinforced " the feeling of being a foreigner " and predicted a further drop in the number of people applying for citizenship .
an interior ministry spokesman defended the examination .
he said that citizens had both rights and duties .
citizenship tests exist in a number of other european union countries , including the uk and the netherlands .
but organizational difficulties could still stand in the way of the punctual launch of the test .
the questions are still being worked on and are not due to be published until the cabinet have approved them in late july or early august .
ulrich aengenvoort , the director of germany 's volkshochschulen -lrb- vhs -rrb- , the educational institutes charged with conducting the test , conceded that the timetable was tight .
however , he said he was confident that the vhs would cope . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the german car industry has welcomed an alternative german-franco deal as " an acceptable compromise . " the compromise , which trades carbon dioxide emissions efficiency for the use of green technologies , was reached on monday , june 9 , and received a cautiously positive reception from the bloc .
" we welcome the convergence of views between members which have big car industries but it 's a discussion that takes place within the council , with all members , " said european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj .
on december 19 , the commission proposed rules limiting the average co2 emissions of all new cars in europe to 130 grams per kilometer driven by the year 2012 - the 2006 european average was 160 grams per kilometer .
that drew criticism from german chancellor angela merkel and german carmakers .
but in consultations with french president nicolas sarkozy , a compromise was put forth whereby auto manufacturers could receive 8 kilograms per kilometer in " green credits " for using environmentally friendly technologies such as solar power .
carmakers mollified bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy saw eye to eye on the alternative co2 proposal the german-french proposal represented " a clear improvement on a proposition by the european commission , " matthias wissmann , head of the german automobile association vda , told dpa news agency .
bdi confederation of german industry spokesman werner schnappauf called the deal an " acceptable compromise , " paying tribute to merkel for " forcefully representing " the german car industry .
" not everything is clear , " added ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a german car specialist .
" but the solution is softer .
the targets will be easier to reach . "
the german car industry is fearful that tough emission targets could disproportionately penalize luxury cars manufacturers like daimler , bmw and audi with their relatively high fuel consumption and emissions and favor french and italian makers of economy cars .
merkel insists the limit should apply across the range for each carmaker , leaving carmakers the possibility of continuing to introduce high-emission luxury models , so long as they compensate by making low-emission models .
environmentalists angered but germany 's environmentalist party , the greens , were predictably less than happy about the commission 's original proposal potentially being watered down .
german media quoted green parliamentary co-leader renate kuenast as saying that merkel had " once again signed off on all of the german auto manufacturers ' propositions . "
the franco-german agreement " meant nothing good for climate protection , " she added .
but nothing firm has been decided .
while welcoming attempts by germany and french to bridge differences , the eu also said that those two nations could not decide the issue alone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 11.06.2008 eu braces for irish referendum under threat of treaty chaos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish referendum hangs in the balance - along with the future of the lisbon treaty ?
ireland goes to the polls thursday in the european union 's only referendum on the lisbon treaty .
eu and irish leaders are holding their collective breath as they hope to avoid disaster . with a traditional eve-of-vote news blackout in operation in ireland on wednesday , the country 's three leading political parties , who have pushed hard for a yes vote , were cautious ahead of the referendum .
as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .
he added that europe would go back to an uncertain situation if the lisbon treaty was defeated .
cowen emphasized that all of ireland 's concerns had been catered to in the treaty , rte reported .
he said it was his deeply held belief that the lisbon treaty was crucial to ireland 's future prospects .
he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .
" the most recent numbers are fairly positive , " stubb said .
the irish referendum topped the agenda of the talks , which also centered on the situation in the middle east , relations with moscow and baltic sea issues . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland goes to the polls thursday in the european union 's only referendum on the lisbon treaty .
eu and irish leaders are holding their collective breath as they hope to avoid disaster . with a traditional eve-of-vote news blackout in operation in ireland on wednesday , the country 's three leading political parties , who have pushed hard for a yes vote , were cautious ahead of the referendum .
as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .
he added that europe would go back to an uncertain situation if the lisbon treaty was defeated .
cowen emphasized that all of ireland 's concerns had been catered to in the treaty , rte reported .
he said it was his deeply held belief that the lisbon treaty was crucial to ireland 's future prospects .
he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .
" the most recent numbers are fairly positive , " stubb said .

ireland goes to the polls thursday in the european union 's only referendum on the lisbon treaty .
eu and irish leaders are holding their collective breath as they hope to avoid disaster . with a traditional eve-of-vote news blackout in operation in ireland on wednesday , the country 's three leading political parties , who have pushed hard for a yes vote , were cautious ahead of the referendum .
as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .
he added that europe would go back to an uncertain situation if the lisbon treaty was defeated .
cowen emphasized that all of ireland 's concerns had been catered to in the treaty , rte reported .
he said it was his deeply held belief that the lisbon treaty was crucial to ireland 's future prospects .
he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .
" the most recent numbers are fairly positive , " stubb said .
the irish referendum topped the agenda of the talks , which also centered on the situation in the middle east , relations with moscow and baltic sea issues . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all options are on the table , " bush warned at a press conference after meeting merkel north of berlin at the end of his last visit to germany before leaving office .
the us preferred a diplomatic solution by working with its partners , bush said .
the five permanent members of the un security council and germany are engaged in efforts to persuade tehran to change course .
there was " a better way forward than isolation " for iran , he said , but he cautioned there could be additional un sanctions on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressuring iran leader ahmadinejad is on bush 's agenda merkel stressed germany 's preference for a diplomatic solution to the impasse , but she warned further sanctions could be applied .
merkel wants better implementation of sanctions " i believe diplomatic pressure has already taken effect , " she said .
merkel called for sanctions already passed by the security council to be better implemented , saying that she preferred the un route as this included russia and china , making sanctions more effective .
this did not exclude further action from the european union , particularly in the banking sector , merkel said .
the two leaders agreed on the need to push forward with the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks , noting that agricultural prices were becoming a crucial issue for developing countries .
bush spoke out against trade protectionism , and merkel highlighted the need for a transatlantic economic partnership - a theme she pressed under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- last year .
cooperation was particularly needed in setting standards for biofuels , merkel said in response to concerns that growing crops for conversion to fuels is resulting in higher food prices .

bush was asked whether he regretted the iraq war , in the light of an interview with the times of london , published wednesday , june 11 , that indicated he regretted his rhetoric during the war .
" no i do n't regret it all .
but i could have used better rhetoric , " bush said .
" the decision to remove saddam hussein was the right decision . "
german press negative on visit german commentators noted that the bush visit was remarkable for the complete lack of public protest .
german political and press comment on the 20-hour visit - bush arrived from an eu-us summit in slovenia tuesday evening - was overwhelmingly negative .
" i wo n't miss george w. bush , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's conservative parliamentary bloc , told berlin regional public radio .
ulrich klose , a spokesman for germany 's other main party , the social democrats , the junior partner in merkel 's broad coalition , criticized bush 's foreign policy as " confrontational , " saying this had damaged the standing of the us in the world .

the us preferred a diplomatic solution by working with its partners , bush said .

the greeks played their typical conservative game - this time it did n't work . the greeks under german coach otto rehhagel won euro 2004 by disrupting opponents ' play and waiting for mistakes , and that was exactly the way they started their 2008 campaign .
spectators in salzburg 's wals-siezenheim stadium were already booing after ten minutes , as it became clear just how much of a slog this match would be .
the lone highlight of the first half came in the 34th minute , when swedish striker zlatan ibrahimovic head narrowly over the crossbar with his back to the goal .
the second half initially brought little improvement - with the greeks almost taking an undeserved lead in the 66th minute after swedish defender petter hansson nearly headed an ill-advised clearance into his own goal .
six decisive minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece gave their supporters no reason to cheer but one minute later , with a goalless draw looking inevitable , sweden had a moment of inspiration .
ibrahimovich used a combination with strike partner henrik larsson to open up space around 16 meters from goal , and he fired a rocket into the upper right-hand corner of the net .
it was sweden 's first shot on goal in the entire match - and simultaneously the game winner .
greece , who had not conceded a goal in the european championship for more than 420 minutes , were forced to emerge from their defensive shell , but they failed to create any clear chances .
instead , in the 72nd minute , larsson maneuvered himself into a 1-on-1 situation against greek keeper antonis nikopolidis .
bildunterschrift : sweden 's second goal was a bit of football slapstick larsson 's shot was dismal , but the greeks failed to clear the ball , and hansson , who had almost been the goat of the match six minutes earlier , got just enough leg on it to complete the scoring .
" we do want to score goals as well but the truth is we do n't score many , " said rehhagel after the match in defense of his conservative tactics .

but the croats have lots of players who ply their trade in the bundesliga .
and a decade ago , the croatian national team proved it could -lrb- man- -rrb- handle the germans . when the members of those two national squads take the pitch on thursday , june 12 in klagenfurt , those with keen memories might be thinking about the past .
in the latter half of the 1990s , the two sides became minor rivals after meeting twice in the space of two years in the quarter-finals of international tournaments .
one person who remembers those encounters very well is germany 's team manager oliver bierhoff , who played on both of those german teams .
it 's hardly surprising then that bierhoff has drawn parallels between the current squad and the one that beat the croats 2-1 in euro 1996 in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff wants germany to think of 1996 " we work very precisely - that 's one of the similarities - but in 1996 we had a lot of experienced players who had won major titles with their clubs and country , " the former striker told the online edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" the current team is a bit more hungry for and curious about what it 's like to win than was the case in 1996 , " bierhoff said .
that game was the first time germany had played post-yugoslavian croatia in a match that counted .
germany went on to win euro 96 , their last major title , thanks to a golden goal by bierhoff .
french fiasco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suker and croatia punished lothar matthaeus and germany in 1998 but two years later , at the 1998 world cup in france , the croats got revenge - and how .
after defender christian woerns was sent off in first half , croatia made a meal of their opponents , winning 3-0 .
the man of the match was croatian striker davor suker , who scored one goal and provoked the foul that left the germans shorthanded .
it was germany 's worst world cup defeat in 44 years and cost coach berti vogts , who had masterminded the 1996 euro win , his job .
" i thought it would be a one-goal game , " vogts said immediately after the debacle .
croatia lost to eventual winners france in the semis and came in third - that 's still the best-ever result for the team , which has only existed in its current form since 1990 .
intimate acquaintances bildunterschrift : croatia 's niko kovac , l , played 15 years in the bundesliga whether the players on thursday know their history is one thing .
what 's beyond doubt is that they know each other .
seven members of the croatian squad play or have played extensively in the german bundesliga .
five of them started in croatia 's lackluster 1-0 opening win against austria .
so how do they reckon their chances ?
" if we play like we did the second half -lrb- against austria -rrb- , we 'll have huge problems versus germany , " defender josip simunic , who plays for hertha berlin , cautioned after that first match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and his brother robert also knows germany inside and out but midfielder niko kovac , who did long stints at hertha , leverkusen and hamburg , has been more optimistic .
" against austria , we had enormous psychological pressure , which paralyzed us for a while , " kovac said .
" we had to win .
now we can and will play much more freely . "
but the pressure wo n't be as extreme on thursday as in either match from the 1990s .
while a win would send either croatia or germany through to the quarterfinals , both teams would stay alive in the group stage , even if they lose . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was sweden 's first shot on goal in the entire match - and simultaneously the game winner .
greece , who had not conceded a goal in the european championship for more than 420 minutes , were forced to emerge from their defensive shell , but they failed to create any clear chances .

" all options are on the table , " bush warned at a press conference after meeting merkel north of berlin at the end of his last visit to germany before leaving office .
the us preferred a diplomatic solution by working with its partners , bush said .
the five permanent members of the un security council and germany are engaged in efforts to persuade tehran to change course .
there was " a better way forward than isolation " for iran , he said , but he cautioned there could be additional un sanctions on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressuring iran leader ahmadinejad is on bush 's agenda merkel stressed germany 's preference for a diplomatic solution to the impasse , but she warned further sanctions could be applied .
merkel wants better implementation of sanctions " i believe diplomatic pressure has already taken effect , " she said .
merkel called for sanctions already passed by the security council to be better implemented , saying that she preferred the un route as this included russia and china , making sanctions more effective .
this did not exclude further action from the european union , particularly in the banking sector , merkel said .
the two leaders agreed on the need to push forward with the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks , noting that agricultural prices were becoming a crucial issue for developing countries .
bush spoke out against trade protectionism , and merkel highlighted the need for a transatlantic economic partnership - a theme she pressed under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- last year .
cooperation was particularly needed in setting standards for biofuels , merkel said in response to concerns that growing crops for conversion to fuels is resulting in higher food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is pushing for more german military in afghanistan on climate change , bush again stressed the need for the major carbon dioxide emitters among developing countries to be included in efforts to halt global warming .
merkel agreed that countries like india and china needed to be included in climate talks , saying that the german initiative in this regard at last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm would be continued in japan next month .
" we need a global agreement under the united nations , " she said .
bush regrets tone in iraq the two leaders also discussed afghanistan , with bush noting progress in healthcare , education and the economy in what he referred to as a " young democracy " emerging from years of tyranny .
bush was asked whether he regretted the iraq war , in the light of an interview with the times of london , published wednesday , june 11 , that indicated he regretted his rhetoric during the war .
" no i do n't regret it all .
but i could have used better rhetoric , " bush said .
" the decision to remove saddam hussein was the right decision . "
german press negative on visit german commentators noted that the bush visit was remarkable for the complete lack of public protest .
german political and press comment on the 20-hour visit - bush arrived from an eu-us summit in slovenia tuesday evening - was overwhelmingly negative .
" i wo n't miss george w. bush , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's conservative parliamentary bloc , told berlin regional public radio .
ulrich klose , a spokesman for germany 's other main party , the social democrats , the junior partner in merkel 's broad coalition , criticized bush 's foreign policy as " confrontational , " saying this had damaged the standing of the us in the world .

bush arrived on his farewell visit to germany tuesday from the eu-us summit in brdo , slovenia to spend the night at schloss meseberg , the baroque palace north of the capital that the german government uses as a guesthouse .

" all options are on the table , " bush warned at a press conference after meeting merkel north of berlin at the end of his last visit to germany before leaving office .
the us preferred a diplomatic solution by working with its partners , bush said .
the five permanent members of the un security council and germany are engaged in efforts to persuade tehran to change course .
there was " a better way forward than isolation " for iran , he said , but he cautioned there could be additional un sanctions on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressuring iran leader ahmadinejad is on bush 's agenda merkel stressed germany 's preference for a diplomatic solution to the impasse , but she warned further sanctions could be applied .
merkel wants better implementation of sanctions " i believe diplomatic pressure has already taken effect , " she said .
merkel called for sanctions already passed by the security council to be better implemented , saying that she preferred the un route as this included russia and china , making sanctions more effective .
this did not exclude further action from the european union , particularly in the banking sector , merkel said .
the two leaders agreed on the need to push forward with the stalled doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks , noting that agricultural prices were becoming a crucial issue for developing countries .
bush spoke out against trade protectionism , and merkel highlighted the need for a transatlantic economic partnership - a theme she pressed under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- last year .
cooperation was particularly needed in setting standards for biofuels , merkel said in response to concerns that growing crops for conversion to fuels is resulting in higher food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is pushing for more german military in afghanistan on climate change , bush again stressed the need for the major carbon dioxide emitters among developing countries to be included in efforts to halt global warming .
merkel agreed that countries like india and china needed to be included in climate talks , saying that the german initiative in this regard at last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm would be continued in japan next month .
" we need a global agreement under the united nations , " she said .
bush regrets tone in iraq the two leaders also discussed afghanistan , with bush noting progress in healthcare , education and the economy in what he referred to as a " young democracy " emerging from years of tyranny .
bush was asked whether he regretted the iraq war , in the light of an interview with the times of london , published wednesday , june 11 , that indicated he regretted his rhetoric during the war .
" no i do n't regret it all .
but i could have used better rhetoric , " bush said .
" the decision to remove saddam hussein was the right decision . "
german press negative on visit german commentators noted that the bush visit was remarkable for the complete lack of public protest .
german political and press comment on the 20-hour visit - bush arrived from an eu-us summit in slovenia tuesday evening - was overwhelmingly negative .
" i wo n't miss george w. bush , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's conservative parliamentary bloc , told berlin regional public radio .
ulrich klose , a spokesman for germany 's other main party , the social democrats , the junior partner in merkel 's broad coalition , criticized bush 's foreign policy as " confrontational , " saying this had damaged the standing of the us in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel returned hospitality extended in crawford , texas even merkel , who has maintained friendly personal relations with the president throughout , looked ahead to the post-bush era that begins in january .
merkel looks to new chapter " this is his last european trip .
a new period will then begin , " she said .
bush arrived on his farewell visit to germany tuesday from the eu-us summit in brdo , slovenia to spend the night at schloss meseberg , the baroque palace north of the capital that the german government uses as a guesthouse .
from berlin , the president flew to rome , where apart from prime minister silvio berlusconi , he was to meet pope benedict xvi .

but the german car industry has welcomed an alternative german-franco deal as " an acceptable compromise . " the compromise , which trades carbon dioxide emissions efficiency for the use of green technologies , was reached on monday , june 9 , and received a cautiously positive reception from the bloc .
" we welcome the convergence of views between members which have big car industries but it 's a discussion that takes place within the council , with all members , " said european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj .
on december 19 , the commission proposed rules limiting the average co2 emissions of all new cars in europe to 130 grams per kilometer driven by the year 2012 - the 2006 european average was 160 grams per kilometer .
that drew criticism from german chancellor angela merkel and german carmakers .
but in consultations with french president nicolas sarkozy , a compromise was put forth whereby auto manufacturers could receive 8 kilograms per kilometer in " green credits " for using environmentally friendly technologies such as solar power .
carmakers mollified bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy saw eye to eye on the alternative co2 proposal the german-french proposal represented " a clear improvement on a proposition by the european commission , " matthias wissmann , head of the german automobile association vda , told dpa news agency .
bdi confederation of german industry spokesman werner schnappauf called the deal an " acceptable compromise , " paying tribute to merkel for " forcefully representing " the german car industry .
" not everything is clear , " added ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a german car specialist .
" but the solution is softer .
the targets will be easier to reach . "
the german car industry is fearful that tough emission targets could disproportionately penalize luxury cars manufacturers like daimler , bmw and audi with their relatively high fuel consumption and emissions and favor french and italian makers of economy cars .
merkel insists the limit should apply across the range for each carmaker , leaving carmakers the possibility of continuing to introduce high-emission luxury models , so long as they compensate by making low-emission models .
environmentalists angered but germany 's environmentalist party , the greens , were predictably less than happy about the commission 's original proposal potentially being watered down .
german media quoted green parliamentary co-leader renate kuenast as saying that merkel had " once again signed off on all of the german auto manufacturers ' propositions . "
the franco-german agreement " meant nothing good for climate protection , " she added .
but nothing firm has been decided .

the fare program includes advertizing spot broadcasts at every euro 2008 game , pitch-side boards , and activities to encourage intercultural exchanges between fans .
but after the weekend 's violence , it remains to be seen whether these measures are enough to tackle a problem that world soccer is finding hard to shake off .
the aims of the fare campaign stand in stark contrast to the realities presented on sunday in which a minority of fans were heard shouting nazi slogans at polish supporters .
uefa rhetoric on the outbreak suggested the soccer body had accepted that violence is always a possibility at high-stakes soccer matches .
" sensitive matches are dotted around the map of austria and switzerland , you can turn anything into a sensitive match if you think twice about it , " a uefa spokesperson told news agency skysports .
" we are not particularly worried about a single episode .
we have a global concept we apply , match by match and city by city .
it is well rehearsed and we hope also for every match it will work . "
danny lynch , spokesperson for anti-racism organization kick it out , which is involved in the fare euro 2008 campaign , said there would always be a minority who use soccer as a vehicle for disruption .
" the events on sunday were carried out by people who have no interest in -lrb- harmonious and respectful ways -rrb- whatsoever .
these far-right groups with links to nazi organizations … thrive on disorder and disruption . "
switzerland prepares for the worst bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and austrian police march off violent fans in klagenfurt in switzerland , attempts to pre-empt violence included written letters to 300 known soccer thugs around europe , warning them that violence at euro 2008 would not be tolerated .
the swiss authorities also converted part of geneva 's palexpo convention center into a temporary detainment hall for soccer thugs and allocated $ 61 million for security at the tournament uefa also shelled out money to battle discrimination at euro 2008 , with over 300,000 euros going toward the fare unite against racism campaign .
despite the vast sums spent on match security and anti-discrimination campaigns , ongoing incidents of soccer violence persist across europe at both domestic and international levels of the game .
" in the uk we 've seen a decrease generally in soccer violence , but at the same time you look at the uefa cup final when glasgow supporters were fighting with police , " said lynch .
" in italy fans are fighting amongst each other .
there are still fans that just go out to fight . "
the problem continues bildunterschrift : german hooligans continue from where they left off in 2006 although kick it out holds hopes that one day soccer can be violence-and-racism-free , danny lynch admits that such problems will likely exist in one form or another for some time to come .
" soccer is unique in many ways , but for 90 minutes there are 30,000 people sat around a field in a situation that they ordinarily would n't be in .
this is the excuse that these people use to have a fight , " he said .
" if you look at the english game 20 years ago , fighting on the terraces was a common event .
now , we do n't see that .
what we do see is a new style of racist abuse : anti-semitism , islamophobia , homophobia .
" to say that -lrb- general soccer violence -rrb- will be stamped out in entirety is difficult , but it seems to be filtering out .
the one thing about the euro championship is that it 's one of the only times players from clubs around europe can come together to play each other .
we need to take the goodness of that and the fact that soccer is for everyone and focus on keeping it . " darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the croats have lots of players who ply their trade in the bundesliga .
and a decade ago , the croatian national team proved it could -lrb- man- -rrb- handle the germans . when the members of those two national squads take the pitch on thursday , june 12 in klagenfurt , those with keen memories might be thinking about the past .
in the latter half of the 1990s , the two sides became minor rivals after meeting twice in the space of two years in the quarter-finals of international tournaments .
one person who remembers those encounters very well is germany 's team manager oliver bierhoff , who played on both of those german teams .
it 's hardly surprising then that bierhoff has drawn parallels between the current squad and the one that beat the croats 2-1 in euro 1996 in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff wants germany to think of 1996 " we work very precisely - that 's one of the similarities - but in 1996 we had a lot of experienced players who had won major titles with their clubs and country , " the former striker told the online edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" the current team is a bit more hungry for and curious about what it 's like to win than was the case in 1996 , " bierhoff said .
that game was the first time germany had played post-yugoslavian croatia in a match that counted .
germany went on to win euro 96 , their last major title , thanks to a golden goal by bierhoff .
french fiasco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suker and croatia punished lothar matthaeus and germany in 1998 but two years later , at the 1998 world cup in france , the croats got revenge - and how .
after defender christian woerns was sent off in first half , croatia made a meal of their opponents , winning 3-0 .
the man of the match was croatian striker davor suker , who scored one goal and provoked the foul that left the germans shorthanded .
it was germany 's worst world cup defeat in 44 years and cost coach berti vogts , who had masterminded the 1996 euro win , his job .
" i thought it would be a one-goal game , " vogts said immediately after the debacle .
croatia lost to eventual winners france in the semis and came in third - that 's still the best-ever result for the team , which has only existed in its current form since 1990 .
intimate acquaintances bildunterschrift : croatia 's niko kovac , l , played 15 years in the bundesliga whether the players on thursday know their history is one thing .
what 's beyond doubt is that they know each other .
seven members of the croatian squad play or have played extensively in the german bundesliga .
five of them started in croatia 's lackluster 1-0 opening win against austria .
so how do they reckon their chances ?
" if we play like we did the second half -lrb- against austria -rrb- , we 'll have huge problems versus germany , " defender josip simunic , who plays for hertha berlin , cautioned after that first match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and his brother robert also knows germany inside and out but midfielder niko kovac , who did long stints at hertha , leverkusen and hamburg , has been more optimistic .
" against austria , we had enormous psychological pressure , which paralyzed us for a while , " kovac said .
" we had to win .
now we can and will play much more freely . "
but the pressure wo n't be as extreme on thursday as in either match from the 1990s .
while a win would send either croatia or germany through to the quarterfinals , both teams would stay alive in the group stage , even if they lose . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with germany celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the introduction of its social-market economy and the d-mark this june , merkel was also at pains to emphasize that these events did not undermine the legitimacy of the existing order .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the ft .
" but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .
my patriotic sensitivity tells me i must stand by these companies in tough times .
we must lead them onto the path of virtue , no question , but one should not condemn them en masse . "
one allegation after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender of the business faith : angela merkel just under two weeks ago , deutsche telekom ceo called in prosecutors to investigate allegations that the company had engaged a data-mining firm to track thousands of calls between top executives and journalists .
snooping accusations have subsequently been levelled in the media against a number of other firms , such as lufthansa and deutsche bahn .
this comes after investigations into bribery at siemens and corruption at volkswagen .
several former bosses at europe 's biggest carmaker have been prosecuted after it emerged in 2005 that a slush fund was set up to pay for holidays and prostitutes .
these scandals and allegations of tax evasion by germany 's high earners earlier this year have stirred up widespread resentment towards the country 's business elite . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland goes to the polls thursday in the european union 's only referendum on the lisbon treaty .
eu and irish leaders are holding their collective breath as they hope to avoid disaster . with a traditional eve-of-vote news blackout in operation in ireland on wednesday , the country 's three leading political parties , who have pushed hard for a yes vote , were cautious ahead of the referendum .
as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .
he added that europe would go back to an uncertain situation if the lisbon treaty was defeated .
cowen emphasized that all of ireland 's concerns had been catered to in the treaty , rte reported .
he said it was his deeply held belief that the lisbon treaty was crucial to ireland 's future prospects .
he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .

but the opposition and migrant organizations have criticised the point of the exercise . the multiple choice test will cover such areas as germany 's political system and society , as well as german history .
the 33 questions will be picked at random from a list of just over 300 .
would-be citizens will have to answer just over half of them correctly .
with the number of people applying for german citizenship in steady declining over recent years , some critics have disputed the necessity of the examination .
others have questioned the sense of something that simply rewards rote learning .
the right approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states of bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg and hesse have pressed for the test green party parliamentarian josef winkler described the test as a " spurious solution for a spurious problem " in an interview with the financial times deutschland .
the left party vice chairwoman halina wawzyniak also described it as " superfluous " .
she called for a comprehensive overhaul of citizenship laws and the relaxation of rules on dual citizenship .
the free democrats ' integration expert sibylle laurischk criticized the content of the test .
" anyone who can learn stuff well off by heart can easily pass a formulaic test of this nature , " she told the ftd .
she called for a flexible approach when evaluating test results , stressing the greater importance of having a good command of the german language .
the chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat , has described the test as a " procedure to select between the educated and the uneducated " .
he said that lower-class migrants would be unable to pass .
in an interview with the epd news agency , kolat accused germany of creating more and more new hurdles to obtaining citizenship , causing migrants , as a result , to increasingly become disaffected .
set to increase alienation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say language classes are more important than swotting for a rote test he said the test reinforced " the feeling of being a foreigner " and predicted a further drop in the number of people applying for citizenship .
an interior ministry spokesman defended the examination .
he said that citizens had both rights and duties .
citizenship tests exist in a number of other european union countries , including the uk and the netherlands .
but organizational difficulties could still stand in the way of the punctual launch of the test .
the questions are still being worked on and are not due to be published until the cabinet have approved them in late july or early august .
ulrich aengenvoort , the director of germany 's volkshochschulen -lrb- vhs -rrb- , the educational institutes charged with conducting the test , conceded that the timetable was tight .

ireland goes to the polls thursday in the european union 's only referendum on the lisbon treaty .
eu and irish leaders are holding their collective breath as they hope to avoid disaster . with a traditional eve-of-vote news blackout in operation in ireland on wednesday , the country 's three leading political parties , who have pushed hard for a yes vote , were cautious ahead of the referendum .
as polls show the result of thursday 's vote is balanced on a knife-edge , prime minister brian cowen told irish national broadcaster broadcaster rte tuesday that if there was a no vote , ireland could not wait another eight years for reform of the eu in order to compete with emerging economies such as china and india .
he added that europe would go back to an uncertain situation if the lisbon treaty was defeated .
cowen emphasized that all of ireland 's concerns had been catered to in the treaty , rte reported .
he said it was his deeply held belief that the lisbon treaty was crucial to ireland 's future prospects .
he was convinced people would see through the negative arguments and expressed confidence that by the time the polls closed the yes side would have prevailed .
opposition fine gael leader enda kenny described thursday as " a moment of truth " for ireland .
labour 's eamon gilmore said a no vote would result in confusion and uncertainty with people worried about their jobs .
unemployment uncertainty may sway voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " camp has enjoyed a spurt in support of late figures released tuesday showed irish unemployment above 200,000 for the first time since 1999 , the equivalent of 5.4 percent of the workforce .
this " was not the time for ireland to raise doubts about our relationship with europe , " he said .
together the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- .
only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty .
sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues such as neutrality , public services and workers ' rights .
a no vote would torpedo the ambitious lisbon treaty , which is designed to reform the 27-nation bloc and make it more efficient and effective in dealing with the challenges posed by globalization .
irish electorate has form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland vetoed the nice treaty in 2002 in 2001 , irish voters rejected the nice treaty , another reform project , but ratified it in a second vote 16 months later after a declaration was inserted clarifying irish neutrality .
this time around it is fears about job security , farming , taxes and religion that have dominated the debate in a country that has been one of the main beneficiaries of eu largesse .
the mood has also been affected by a sharp fall in growth that has raised fears the " celtic tiger " is losing its bite , leaving people worried about their financial future .
sinn fein has claimed the treaty would open the door to tax harmonization , forcing ireland to scrap the low corporate taxes that have attracted many foreign companies to the country .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has taken pains to point out that approval of the treaty would still leave ireland with a veto on tax issues .
but no campaigners accused the eu chief of putting a gun to irish heads when he stated in brussels recently that europe " will pay a price " if voters reject the treaty .
referendum in the balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " nays " seem to have it latest opinion polls show that the outcome of the referendum hangs in the balance .
there has been a surge in support for the no campaign to 35-39 percent , while those backing yes are down to between 30-42 percent , leaving around one-third of the 3.1-million electorate undecided .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty , which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
ominously , just as in the french and dutch votes , opinion polls now show that ireland 's yes campaign is struggling to gain ground , despite the support of all major political groups .
" the campaign has been set up and framed by the no vote : the yes camp is trying at the last moment to regain the momentum , " piotr kaczynski , an expert on eu constitutional affairs at the centre for european policy studies in brussels , said .
no vote could stop eu reform in its tracks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clear skies above the eu but are more clouds gathering ?
observers agree that the impact of a no vote could , if it were based on a high turnout -lrb- approaching 50 percent -rrb- , bring the process of eu reform to an abrupt and painful end .
a resounding no vote would " pretty much mean closing the -lrb- eu -rrb- constitutional process ...
you could forget about treaty reform in the eu-27 , " kaczynski said .
it could even trigger an eu-wide upheaval , potentially splitting the bloc into a " two-speed europe . "
member states " could abandon the -lrb- 27-member -rrb- treaty and push ahead with smaller groups " on specific issues , relegating opponents of deeper union to " second-tier membership , " brady said .
indeed , experts say that if the lisbon treaty fails , states which favor closer integration could decide that it is time to forge ahead with what the treaty calls " enhanced cooperation " with a select group of partners - leaving the rest in the cold .
" the lisbon treaty allows " enhanced cooperation , " but it sets rules - for example , that you ca n't block anyone from joining it if they fulfill the criteria .
if the enhanced cooperation is done outside the treaties , those rules are n't clear , " kaczynski warned .
in the short term , those doomsday scenarios seem unlikely to become reality .
in the three years since the french and dutch referenda , the eu has not only managed to keep functioning , it has even enlarged to take in two new members , romania and bulgaria .
and while no less a figure than barroso himself warned , before the french vote , that there was " no plan b , " the eu survived to approve just such a plan b : the lisbon treaty itself .
irish rejection would add pressure on bickering europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way would the eu go if ireland says no ?
but a no vote would , most certainly , cast the spotlight on brussels , as the eu 's leaders - scheduled to hold a summit in the city on june 19 - debate why the world 's biggest trading bloc finds it so hard to win the support of its own people .
and with issues from oil and food prices to climate change crowding onto the agenda , the last thing the bloc can afford is yet another summit dominated by agonized soul-searching .
meanwhile , the german and finnish foreign ministers have expressed the wish that the irish electorate vote in favor of treaty of lisbon .
" we hope and wish that the referendum in ireland has a positive result , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said when the two ministers met in berlin tuesday .
steinmeier and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , said they were optimistic on a yes vote in thursday 's referendum .
" the most recent numbers are fairly positive , " stubb said .
the irish referendum topped the agenda of the talks , which also centered on the situation in the middle east , relations with moscow and baltic sea issues . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in an interview published in british daily newspaper the times , bush said his stance over iraq had made the world believe that he was a " guy really anxious for war . "
his use of phrases such as " bring them on " and " dead or alive " had indicated to people that " i was , you know , not a man of peace , " bush said .

" in an interview published in british daily newspaper the times , bush said his stance over iraq had made the world believe that he was a " guy really anxious for war . "
his use of phrases such as " bring them on " and " dead or alive " had indicated to people that " i was , you know , not a man of peace , " bush said .
" i could have used a different tone " " look , i think that in retrospect , you know , i could have used a different tone , " he told the times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is " painful " to put soldiers in harms way , bush says but the truth was that he found it " very painful to put youngsters in harm 's way " and that he had an obligation to make sure that those lives were not lost in vain , he said .
bush has been widely accused of pressing for military intervention in iraq from shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks , despite little or no evidence of a link with the " 9/11 " hijackers .
the us leader insisted that he had pressed hard for a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
bush calls diplomacy efforts an " untold story " " one of the untold stories of iraq is that we explored diplomacy a lot , " he said .
" we all wanted to solve this ' disclose , disarm , or face serious consequences ' in a diplomatic fashion .
after all , i went to the united nations security council , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush declared combat over in 2003 bush said he was concerned that policies by democratic presidential hopeful barack obama might open divisions in western attitudes towards iran 's nuclear ambitions .
the world ought to work together and " keep focused , " bush told the paper .
bush predicts strategic accord with iraq meanwhile , in a question and answer session following a final state visit to german chancellor angela merkel , bush predicted washington and baghdad would work through rifts and reach a deal on the continued deployment of us forces in iraq .
" i think we 'll end up with a strategic agreement with iraq .
there 's all kinds of noise in their system and our system , " he said .
bush made his comments during a european tour that took him to germany on tuesday and wednesday , june 10 and 11 , and will go on to italy , france and britain . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the croats have lots of players who ply their trade in the bundesliga .
and a decade ago , the croatian national team proved it could -lrb- man- -rrb- handle the germans . when the members of those two national squads take the pitch on thursday , june 12 in klagenfurt , those with keen memories might be thinking about the past .
in the latter half of the 1990s , the two sides became minor rivals after meeting twice in the space of two years in the quarter-finals of international tournaments .
one person who remembers those encounters very well is germany 's team manager oliver bierhoff , who played on both of those german teams .
it 's hardly surprising then that bierhoff has drawn parallels between the current squad and the one that beat the croats 2-1 in euro 1996 in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bierhoff wants germany to think of 1996 " we work very precisely - that 's one of the similarities - but in 1996 we had a lot of experienced players who had won major titles with their clubs and country , " the former striker told the online edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" the current team is a bit more hungry for and curious about what it 's like to win than was the case in 1996 , " bierhoff said .
that game was the first time germany had played post-yugoslavian croatia in a match that counted .
germany went on to win euro 96 , their last major title , thanks to a golden goal by bierhoff .
french fiasco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suker and croatia punished lothar matthaeus and germany in 1998 but two years later , at the 1998 world cup in france , the croats got revenge - and how .
after defender christian woerns was sent off in first half , croatia made a meal of their opponents , winning 3-0 .
the man of the match was croatian striker davor suker , who scored one goal and provoked the foul that left the germans shorthanded .
it was germany 's worst world cup defeat in 44 years and cost coach berti vogts , who had masterminded the 1996 euro win , his job .
" i thought it would be a one-goal game , " vogts said immediately after the debacle .
croatia lost to eventual winners france in the semis and came in third - that 's still the best-ever result for the team , which has only existed in its current form since 1990 .
intimate acquaintances bildunterschrift : croatia 's niko kovac , l , played 15 years in the bundesliga whether the players on thursday know their history is one thing .
what 's beyond doubt is that they know each other .
seven members of the croatian squad play or have played extensively in the german bundesliga .
five of them started in croatia 's lackluster 1-0 opening win against austria .
so how do they reckon their chances ?
" if we play like we did the second half -lrb- against austria -rrb- , we 'll have huge problems versus germany , " defender josip simunic , who plays for hertha berlin , cautioned after that first match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and his brother robert also knows germany inside and out but midfielder niko kovac , who did long stints at hertha , leverkusen and hamburg , has been more optimistic .
" against austria , we had enormous psychological pressure , which paralyzed us for a while , " kovac said .
" we had to win .
now we can and will play much more freely . "
but the pressure wo n't be as extreme on thursday as in either match from the 1990s .
while a win would send either croatia or germany through to the quarterfinals , both teams would stay alive in the group stage , even if they lose . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a mobile hospital run by the german red cross has been in the region for about three weeks .
the german aid workers will soon hand over the reins to their chinese colleagues . zhong de the second has digestion problems .
the tiny tot was born three days ago by caesarean section and is with his mother at the mobile red cross hospital in the city of dujiangyan .
zhong de means “ china germany ” - he is the second baby with this name to have been born in this white tent , which the red cross has erected on a closed off part of the local motorway .
the young parents chose the name to express their thanks to the german helpers in the area .
in a few days , zhong de will move to another tent city .
like millions of others in the quake zone , he and his family are likely to live in the open air for an uncertain length of time .
mobile hospital replaces damaged facilities the hospitals in the city of dujiangyan , which has 600,000 inhabitants , are only partly usable at the moment .
the mobile red cross hospital has been able to fill the gap .
it gets about 900 visitors a day - mainly outpatients such as the 78-year-old mrs zhou : “ i have breathing problems .
usually i only have them in winter but since the earthquake i ’ ve been sleeping outside every night in a tent .
that ’ s made me really ill . ”
mrs zhou ’ s husband brought her to the hospital on the back of his bicycle .
next to them waits three-year-old xinrui .
she has had a fever and a sore throat for days says the mother : “ this is the only functioning hospital in dujiangyan .
the others can ’ t do much at all because they don ’ t have the right equipment anymore .
the red cross hospital is the best in the city . ”
usable all over the world the doctors and nurses have all come from the other hospitals .
the german team has taken on a backseat role , giving advice when asked because the philosophy is for local doctors to be able to run the hospital independently of the red cross .
“ our hospital has been set up in such a way that it can be used all over the world , ” explained thomas moch the team leader .
“ here in china we were sub-standard and tried to adapt very quickly to the circumstances .
we brought more technical equipment than we normally would . ”
“ this hospital offers good quality and appropriate technology .
but in contrast to the expectations - in germany too perhaps - we ’ re never fast enough to rescue earthquake victims .
that can ’ t work .
even if we ’ re really very fast we still need five days .
we replace damaged health facilities . ”
handing over agreement treatment in the red cross hospital is still free for the moment and this will continue as part of the handing over agreement to the chinese red cross .
however , after three months , the hospital will be fully integrated into the chinese health system and will function according to the country ’ s conditions .
the transfer should be smooth , thinks thomas moch who says there is a very highly-motivated and well-qualified chinese team .
the young chinese doctor zhu jiang is also full of praise : “ after the earthquake catastrophe , the germans provided exactly the kind of help that was necessary here .
that ’ s very good .
with the help of modern equipment , the death rate in such situations decreases and patients can be better treated .

the cfoa says crews barely coped with uk floods last summer , when yorkshire and gloucestershire were worst hit .
in england and wales there is no legal obligation to rescue flood victims , but the cfoa wants it to be the legal duty of all fire and rescue services .
the environment agency is calling for a " national effort " to tackle flooding .
sir michael pitt , who is leading a government review into flooding response , is expected to make recommendations about rescue provision when he publishes his report later this year . "
we have a moral obligation to help people " toby kempton under the current system , teams from neighbouring areas tend to help out on an ad hoc basis .
some fire authorities have invested in training , but others have not .
in the west midlands , wales and north-west england there are dozens of specialist teams , but in the south-east england and east anglia there are very few locally based rescue crews .
additional back-up is provided by highly trained volunteers from organisation such as the rnli , rapid uk & sara -lrb- the severn area rescue association -rrb- .
in scotland , it is a statutory duty for fire and rescue services to provide this type of cover .
the chief fire officer in hereford and worcester , paul hayden , who coordinates the cfoa 's flood rescue deployments , said : " in one area the fire service does rescues , in another nobody does rescues and there 's parts of the country where there 's no rescue provision at all . "
he estimates that if there were a breach of flood defences along the east coast , he would only have half the crews he would need .
' selfless ' people he added that the problems were compounded by a division of responsibility at government level .
" we 've got defra which is responsible for floods but not rescue .
we 've got the department for communities and local government , which is responsible for some forms of rescue but not floods .
" we just need the tools to get on and do the job . "
last summer 3,000 people were rescued from the floods in the north of england in june and 4,000 were rescued a month later in the south of england and west midlands .
the firefighters and volunteers who saved them found they struggled to cope .
toby kempton , watch manager at evesham fire station , in worcestershire , said : " we found ourselves working for 30 hours .
" we tried to ask control to take us off the run to get some rest , food and dry clothes .
but , unfortunately , the messages just came back , ' persons reported , persons reported ' .
" we have a moral obligation to help people .

six major developments will be built across the kingdom over the next 15 years , the centrepiece being king abdullah economic city , 100km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- north of jeddah .
the new city is rising from the sands of the arabian desert and when complete it will stretch over 150 sq miles -lrb- 388 sq km -rrb- .

at current market prices that is worth well over $ 1bn -lrb- £ 510m -rrb- daily .
during the last oil boom , vast sums of money were spent by the government on projects that failed - saudi arabia famously tried to " make the desert bloom " with water-intensive agriculture schemes .

you are talking about creating job opportunities .
" you are talking about establishing an industrial infrastructure for the future generations " .
expatriate labour the new industries will include the production of aluminium , steel , fertilizer and petrochemicals .
an army of foreign workers , mostly from south asia , are building the infrastructure that is needed and the accompanying residential areas .
the labourers are cheap and are prepared to do jobs that saudis refuse to do .
king abdullah is seen as a reformer in a conservative political establishment for decades saudi arabia has been dependent on skilled and unskilled expatriate labour , but in recent years the government has been trying to get more saudis into work with employment schemes like saudisation .
they have had mixed success .
take the water bottling plant run by the delta marketing company in jeddah .
just 12 % of the workforce on the factory floor is saudi , including 40 women .
in the whole company , a fifth of the workers are saudi , which meets the government quota but is still low by international standards .
" low-educated saudis have very few choices , " said the water division manager , nidal abdul kareem , who is jordanian .
" -lsb- they can -rsb- work in the unskilful work with low salaries and compete with the expats .
or they can stay at home without work and some of them unfortunately like to stay at home without work .
sometimes you feel strange that they do n't like to work . "
foreign influence despite the difficulties saudi arabia is undoubtedly in the process of enormous change , which is being fuelled by the oil boom and globalisation .
the construction programme is taking place on a massive scale new shopping centres are being built , like the enormous red sea mall in jeddah .
satellite television and music from the west are also having an impact on the youthful population .
there will be several universities in the new economic cities , which reforming saudis believe could be the catalyst for social freedoms .
" this is part of a kingdom-wide change in philosophy whereby we are improving education systems , " said mr rasheed .
" in kaec we will have a global education system that aspires to have students graduate at a global level in terms of their understanding of the world , how they view the world and how they want to be a part of it . "

while downloads may pose a threat to the time-honoured business model of the major labels , many forgotten acts have been able to revive their fortunes by selling their songs over the web , direct to the consumer .
yet even by 21st-century standards , the career of world music pioneer ahmed fakroun is unusual , to say the least .
born in the libyan city of benghazi , he spent long periods in the uk and france in the 1970s and 1980s , recording a handful of singles and albums that now fetch high prices on record collectors ' websites .
but he was reduced to a mere mention in specialist music encyclopaedias after libya 's years of international isolation made it difficult for him to market his music to the outside world .
however , he recently came to prominence among obscurity-hungry club djs when some of his early songs were rediscovered , re-edited and reissued anonymously .
thanks to internet chat forums and blogs , his identity was soon revealed - and taking advantage of his renewed visibility , he has made his music available legally on download store 7digital .
sanctions ahmed fakroun looked set to make his mark in world music circles in the mid-1980s when his album mots d 'amour , combining traditional arab instruments and melodies with electronic music and dance rhythms , was released on the celluloid label in france .
but then came the us aerial bombing of libya in april 1986 , followed by years of international sanctions , as evidence of terror links turned libya 's government into a pariah of the west and seriously impeded its citizens ' freedom of movement .
" when i look to my press book , i found the articles stopped in 1986 , " he told the bbc .
" it was so difficult for me to be in two places at the same time .
" to take a plane to go from my home town to any part of the world , i had to go across the tunisian border to jerboa , about 700km , or take a boat to malta overnight , then -lsb- travel -rsb- the next day to the other part of the planet .
imagine the rest of the story . "
as it happened , record companies did manage to market arabic pop to international music fans at that time , but fakroun missed out .
instead , all the action came from neighbouring algeria , as khaled , cheb mami and others introduced the world to the north african sound known as rai music .
' arabic r & b ' and that seemed to be that , until about a year ago .
then a new york-based dj known as prince language unearthed an old ahmed fakroun track called soleil soleil , re-edited it and put it out on a 12-inch single , renamed yo son .
websites devoted to club culture immediately raved about it .
" prince language delivers an edit of an 80s obscurity that sounds like it could have been an outtake from talking heads backing an arabic r & b group , " said one .
a few months later , some french djs working under the name of les edits du golem released a 12-inch ep featuring a tune called pyramide - in reality , a re-edited version of fakroun 's 1977 single nisyan .
rising cult interest in the two records prompted some crate-digging detective work .
and by the end of 2007 , music blogs such as dilated choonz were able to disclose who was really behind them .
even though neither record was authorised by fakroun , he was grateful for the renewed exposure .
" i was very happy that these tracks are still alive in people 's minds , " he says .
" thanks to those djs from all over the world , playing and re-editing and refreshing those tracks .
no , i do n't mind .
it 's good for me to hear them in a good re-edit or mix , as long as they respect copyrights . "
no middle-man since april this year , ahmed fakroun has had 20 of his songs available for download from 7digital 's indiestore - an offshoot of the firm 's main site that allows singers and bands to create their own digital music shop .
" it happened through a fingertip .
i happened to find -lsb- the store -rsb- while i was surfing and i tell you , i am happy to find them .
it was n't too complicated , my fans started to know about it and others discovered it , " he says .
artists can set their own price for songs in pounds , dollars or euros .
fakroun has chosen to charge 99 us cents each for his .
all music is sold without digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- copy protection .
the artist pays an annual fee for the service -lrb- £ 75 , $ 99 or 99 euros -rrb- and gets 80 % of the revenue from sales .

the welsh assembly government 's plans aim to see councils required by law to bring in the childcare provision .
it comes a day after figures showed a rise in the number of children living below the poverty line .
the conservatives said the assembly government 's targets to halve child poverty by 2010 were now unrealistic .
it has been reported that 29 % of children in wales currently live under the poverty line , in households with incomes below 60 % of the average - an increase of 1 % over the previous year .
the assembly government 's policies are designed to improve life opportunities for disadvantaged children , encourage financial inclusion , and also persuade more people to claim their entitlements for tax and benefits support .
new welsh laws the plans include new laws to place a requirement on local authorities to secure free childcare for two year olds in the poorest or most " disadvantaged target areas " - although the coalition government 's one wales agreement also includes a pledge to provide " universal affordable childcare " by 2011 .
there is also a proposal for a new law to place a duty on councils and other public bodies such as national parks and the fire service to demonstrate their contribution to ending child poverty in wales .
the assembly government 's consultation paper makes clear however that " no additional funding will be made available to public agencies for them to carry out -lsb- these -rsb- duties . "
challenging targets the minister for social justice and local government , brian gibbons , admitted securing a significant reduction in child poverty would be extremely challenging , within the context of increasing household costs on basics such as fuel and food .
" i agree it will be more difficult to achieve this in an adverse economic situation , but the lesson is not to abandon the field of play , but to redouble our efforts , " he said .
dr gibbons also admitted although there had been a great deal of success in the early years of labour 's attempt to halve child poverty by 2010 , there had been a degree of " stagnation " more recently , which implies a failure to maintain the necessary momentum to achieve the government 's own targets .
according to the welsh conservative leader , nick bourne , the assembly government 's targets on reducing child poverty were now " totally unrealistic . "

the conservation of atlantic salmon in scotland -lrb- cass -rrb- initiative deals with threats in eight rivers , including the tay , tweed , dee , spey and south esk .
those involved claim it has boosted fish access , restocked restored areas with local wild salmon and stopped commercial netting on certain rivers .
the project started in 2004 and is due to be completed in july .
about 90 delegates are attending the conference at redgorton in perthshire to hear about the outcome of the cass scheme .
the gathering was opened by environment minister mike russell .
he said : " biodiversity surrounds us everywhere we go .
in scotland , it is one of our country 's most valuable assets and the atlantic salmon truly is an iconic component of that .
" scotland is a european stronghold for the atlantic salmon .
our great salmon rivers rank amongst the very finest and make a very significant contribution to the social , economic and environmental make-up of scotland . "
the salmon 's value as a barometer of the health of the environment is well recognized " colin galbraith scottish natural heritage " the conservation of this species and the habitats which support it remains a constant objective for all who recognise its status . "
the other rivers involved in the cass project are the oykel , bladnoch and moriston .
the scheme has also seen grazing controlled to protect river banks , a bigger variety of plants encouraged along the waters and projects to improve awareness among school pupils and the public .
colin galbraith , from scottish natural heritage , said : " the condition of scotland 's rivers is a key influence on the future prospects of scotland 's native salmon .
" these salmon rivers , amongst the finest in the world , are also vitally important natural habitats for many other important members of the scottish flora and fauna .

mr kiet was unusual among communist leaders for his blunt criticism of government policy .
he became prime minister in 1991 and held office until he stepped down in favour of phan van khai in 1997 .
he had been in poor health in recent days and died at a singapore hospital , relatives said .
economic growth among the grey ranks of vietnam 's communist leadership few figures have ever stood out .
one of the few was former prime minister vo van kiet .
vo van kiet prime minister : 1991 - 1997 seen as a reformer , helped create doi moi joined indochinese communist party in 1939 credited as the author of the reforms known as doi moi , which have transformed vietnam 's economy , he was a rarity among senior officials in speaking out publicly against the failings of the communist system .
born in a village in the mekong delta , he was a veteran fighter in the long war against french and then american military forces in south vietnam .
his first wife and four children died in the war .
after the communist victory in 1975 he became party secretary of saigon , and quietly defied hard-line official policy by trying to work with officials and businesses associated with the defeated government .
his experiments with diluting orthodox socialism in the city eventually encouraged the communist party to adopt market reforms for the whole country in 1986 , at a time when the economy was in ruins .
it took many years for those reforms to take root - but as prime minister mr kiet presided over a period of dramatic economic growth and foreign investment .
he remained an outspoken critic of official corruption and an advocate of reconciliation with opponents of communist rule - arguing that the brutal re-unification of north and south after 1975 had caused pain to millions .

mr kiet was unusual among communist leaders for his blunt criticism of government policy .
he became prime minister in 1991 and held office until he stepped down in favour of phan van khai in 1997 .
he had been in poor health in recent days and died at a singapore hospital , relatives said .
economic growth among the grey ranks of vietnam 's communist leadership few figures have ever stood out .
one of the few was former prime minister vo van kiet .
vo van kiet prime minister : 1991 - 1997 seen as a reformer , helped create doi moi joined indochinese communist party in 1939 credited as the author of the reforms known as doi moi , which have transformed vietnam 's economy , he was a rarity among senior officials in speaking out publicly against the failings of the communist system .
born in a village in the mekong delta , he was a veteran fighter in the long war against french and then american military forces in south vietnam .
his first wife and four children died in the war .
after the communist victory in 1975 he became party secretary of saigon , and quietly defied hard-line official policy by trying to work with officials and businesses associated with the defeated government .
his experiments with diluting orthodox socialism in the city eventually encouraged the communist party to adopt market reforms for the whole country in 1986 , at a time when the economy was in ruins .
it took many years for those reforms to take root - but as prime minister mr kiet presided over a period of dramatic economic growth and foreign investment .
he remained an outspoken critic of official corruption and an advocate of reconciliation with opponents of communist rule - arguing that the brutal re-unification of north and south after 1975 had caused pain to millions .

there are also fears over 150 positions in corporate services , which are still under threat , but barclaycard and sse both believe new posts could be found for those concerned .

staff at the customer service centre were told the news on tuesday last month barclaycard announced its intention to shut the north lanarkshire site with the loss of up to 950 jobs - just two months after it took over the credit card company in march .
but on tuesday , employees were told scottish & southern energy -lrb- sse -rrb- had agreed to buy the site , safeguarding up to 800 of the posts .
" we broke into cheers when we heard it , " said jane hollinsworth , a marketing services adviser with the company for two years .
" comparing that to the initial reaction a few weeks ago- it was like day and night .
everyone was clapping and cheering , everyone is over the moon . "
sse , formerly scottish hydro electric , plans to complete the takeover by the end of the year .
staff will be trained on how to transfer their financial services skills to the energy sector in autumn .
simon howland , operations manager for customer services , has worked for goldfish for six years .
he said his colleagues were used to change .
he said : " we 've been through various different mergers and purchases - from morgan stanley to barclaycard .
it 's probably the best news we 've had for quite a long time kay-louise foley customer service adviser " to be honest , everyone who has worked for goldfish has been very adaptable .
in the last four years there has been change all the time - we 've changed systems , we 've changed the way we do things - so we 'll be completely adaptable .
we 'll be right on board for everything . "
but there is some concern that the new jobs offered by sse will not be as highly skilled .
there are also fears over 150 positions in corporate services , which are still under threat , but barclaycard and sse both believe new posts could be found for those concerned .
rosemary mckenna , the labour mp for the area said she wanted re-assurances over the type of jobs being offered .
she said : " i will be seeking a meeting with scottish and southern to find out their plans for the site , but particularly for the workforce .
" among the questions i will be asking are , will they be offering opportunities to all the employees currently on the site ?
and what quality of jobs will be on offer to a first-class workforce ? "
party atmosphere but despite the reservations , there was something of a party atmosphere at the site after the announcement .
banners , flags and balloons - put up as part of the celebrations for euro 2008 - decorated the huge open plan office .
and the staff who were not offering advice over the phones , were huddled in groups talking about the " good news " .
kay-louise foley , who has been a customer service adviser at the centre for just under a year said : " it 's probably the best news we 've had for quite a long time .
we really were n't sure what the announcement was going to be , so we 're all pretty chuffed actually .

alongside you are top names like lewis hamilton , felipe massa and kimi raikkonen .
the cars ' engines are screaming and everyone is poised to go .
for any formula one fan the chance to race against their heroes would be a dream come true .
sadly , the closest most of us have ever got is watching the grand prix on television .
but that could soon change if a company from the netherlands has its way .
" it 's clear that the next trend in gaming is going to be bringing real objects into the virtual world ; playing not against other gamers but people doing the real thing , " said andy lurling , founder of iopener media .
the patented system his company is developing sucks in real-time gps data from racing events and pumps it out to compatible games consoles and pcs .
the idea is that you could pit yourself against the top drivers in the world , as it happens , from the comfort of your living room .
" you can compete against the best of the best , " he told bbc news .
' hardcore appeal ' and if all of this sounds far fetched , think again .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- was so impressed with his proposal , it gave mr lurling 's company a grant to develop a proof of concept .
a german venture capitalist has stumped up cash to develop it further .
driving the boundaries of realism he has already tested it with an f1 car and plans to have the first games on the market as early as september this year .
" at this point we have lots of interest and we are looking for the right partner to launch , " he said .
the firm is currently in talks with six developers about using the technology .
gareth wilson , design manager at bizarre creations , makers of the project gotham racing series , says he thinks games with the real-time feature would " excite a hardcore minority of gamers " .
" formula 1 and similar complex simulation games are getting less mass market nowadays , compared to their more arcade-style heyday in the late 90s , " he told bbc news .
" this sort of feature would probably appeal to the hardcore gamer or f1 fan more than a mass market gamer .
" having said that , the hardcore would totally love it . "
bizarre creations is not currently one of the firms evaluating the system .
precision position at the core of iopener 's technology is an enhanced gps system known as differential gps -lrb- dgps -rrb- .
this uses a network of fixed base stations to correct the gps signal , which on its own may only be accurate to within 10m .
dgps is commonly used for air navigation or shipping where precision is key .
1 .
car position located with global navigation satellite systems 2 .
location data and car telemetry is beamed to a track side server 3 .
data is tagged with unique id of the car and sent over the internet 4 .
information stored on servers and " mediacast " to gamers .
whole process from car to gamer takes less than five seconds " with that we know the location and the velocity of the car , " explained mr lurling .
as further precision is needed , iopener can use information from the european egnos network , which augments gps satellite signals to provide positional data accurate to within 2m .
other tweaks include fitting cars with an inertial measurement unit -lrb- imu -rrb- , commonly used in guided missile systems , which measure acceleration , angle and yaw of the object .
" imus give accuracy on a short range , " mr lurling told bbc news .
" combined with dgps , we know the location of the car to within less than 30 centimetres . "
in addition , the system collects telemetry data from the car , which is fitted with a small computer , transmitter and the gps receiver .
" that is already good enough data for a game , " he said .
telemetry is commonly collected by track-side engineers to monitor the vehicles ' performance and can include information such as acceleration and what gear the car is in .
it has already used by games developers to build more realistic simulations .
designers at bizarre creations used the telemetry to generate accurate track models for early f1 games , before detailed circuit maps existed , for example .
from the track side , the data is sent over the net to a server farm , where it is saved before being pumped out - or " mediacast " - to eager gamers .
the delay between collecting the data and the gamer being immersed in it is up to five seconds , similar to the lag on a tv broadcast .
" we also store the data , so not only can you play the game in real time , but you can replay races at a later date , " said mr lurling .
intelligent gaming the company does not intend to develop its own games ; rather it will provide the backbone for games developers to build on to .
but it will provide some software ; specifically an artificial intelligence -lrb- ai -rrb- program to make sure that the virtual and real worlds blend seamlessly .
artificial intelligence handles collisions between real and virtual drivers " if hamilton is driving behind you he ca n't see you -lsb- in the game -rsb- , so he would drive right through you , " explained mr lurling .
" so the ai takes over at that point and you see a very realistic overtaking . "
the system also handles the results of in-game collisions between real and virtual drivers .
in this case , the real car always drives away .
the gamer 's fate is less certain .
" we go for optimal realism but the game experience has to be right , " he said .
mr wilson agrees with this approach .
" there is a huge difference between what happens in the real world and what happens in video games - even the most ' realistic ' simulator has to bend real world physics to make the game more fun , " he said .
however , even with the ai , he thinks gamers may encounter a more fundamental frustration with the system .
" i know i would n't even get close to the lap times that lewis hamilton could run , unless my car in the virtual world had a load of extra grip and power - which might defeat the point , " he said .
at the moment , iopener is concentrating firmly on racing games , but believes that there is a huge market for the system in other sports .
" you can think of biking , rowing , skiing and snowboarding , " said mr lurling .
" in the next three to five years , we believe that games will not be ' triple a ' games unless they have our feature in , " he said .
mr lurling was the 2006 dutch regional winner of the european satellite navigation competition -lrb- galileo masters -rrb- which aims to find novel uses for location data .
the 2008 competition is now open to entries , until 31 july .

" imus give accuracy on a short range , " mr lurling told bbc news .
" combined with dgps , we know the location of the car to within less than 30 centimetres . "
in addition , the system collects telemetry data from the car , which is fitted with a small computer , transmitter and the gps receiver .
" that is already good enough data for a game , " he said .
telemetry is commonly collected by track-side engineers to monitor the vehicles ' performance and can include information such as acceleration and what gear the car is in .
it has already used by games developers to build more realistic simulations .
designers at bizarre creations used the telemetry to generate accurate track models for early f1 games , before detailed circuit maps existed , for example .
from the track side , the data is sent over the net to a server farm , where it is saved before being pumped out - or " mediacast " - to eager gamers .
the delay between collecting the data and the gamer being immersed in it is up to five seconds , similar to the lag on a tv broadcast .
" we also store the data , so not only can you play the game in real time , but you can replay races at a later date , " said mr lurling .
intelligent gaming the company does not intend to develop its own games ; rather it will provide the backbone for games developers to build on to .
but it will provide some software ; specifically an artificial intelligence -lrb- ai -rrb- program to make sure that the virtual and real worlds blend seamlessly .
artificial intelligence handles collisions between real and virtual drivers " if hamilton is driving behind you he ca n't see you -lsb- in the game -rsb- , so he would drive right through you , " explained mr lurling .
" so the ai takes over at that point and you see a very realistic overtaking . "
the system also handles the results of in-game collisions between real and virtual drivers .
in this case , the real car always drives away .
the gamer 's fate is less certain .
" we go for optimal realism but the game experience has to be right , " he said .
mr wilson agrees with this approach .
" there is a huge difference between what happens in the real world and what happens in video games - even the most ' realistic ' simulator has to bend real world physics to make the game more fun , " he said .
however , even with the ai , he thinks gamers may encounter a more fundamental frustration with the system .
" i know i would n't even get close to the lap times that lewis hamilton could run , unless my car in the virtual world had a load of extra grip and power - which might defeat the point , " he said .
at the moment , iopener is concentrating firmly on racing games , but believes that there is a huge market for the system in other sports .
" you can think of biking , rowing , skiing and snowboarding , " said mr lurling .
" in the next three to five years , we believe that games will not be ' triple a ' games unless they have our feature in , " he said .
mr lurling was the 2006 dutch regional winner of the european satellite navigation competition -lrb- galileo masters -rrb- which aims to find novel uses for location data .
the 2008 competition is now open to entries , until 31 july .

" it 's clear that the next trend in gaming is going to be bringing real objects into the virtual world ; playing not against other gamers but people doing the real thing , " said andy lurling , founder of iopener media .

the firm is currently in talks with six developers about using the technology .
gareth wilson , design manager at bizarre creations , makers of the project gotham racing series , says he thinks games with the real-time feature would " excite a hardcore minority of gamers " .
" formula 1 and similar complex simulation games are getting less mass market nowadays , compared to their more arcade-style heyday in the late 90s , " he told bbc news .

alongside you are top names like lewis hamilton , felipe massa and kimi raikkonen .
the cars ' engines are screaming and everyone is poised to go .
for any formula one fan the chance to race against their heroes would be a dream come true .
sadly , the closest most of us have ever got is watching the grand prix on television .
but that could soon change if a company from the netherlands has its way .
" it 's clear that the next trend in gaming is going to be bringing real objects into the virtual world ; playing not against other gamers but people doing the real thing , " said andy lurling , founder of iopener media .
the patented system his company is developing sucks in real-time gps data from racing events and pumps it out to compatible games consoles and pcs .
the idea is that you could pit yourself against the top drivers in the world , as it happens , from the comfort of your living room .
" you can compete against the best of the best , " he told bbc news .
' hardcore appeal ' and if all of this sounds far fetched , think again .
the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- was so impressed with his proposal , it gave mr lurling 's company a grant to develop a proof of concept .
a german venture capitalist has stumped up cash to develop it further .
driving the boundaries of realism he has already tested it with an f1 car and plans to have the first games on the market as early as september this year .
" at this point we have lots of interest and we are looking for the right partner to launch , " he said .
the firm is currently in talks with six developers about using the technology .
gareth wilson , design manager at bizarre creations , makers of the project gotham racing series , says he thinks games with the real-time feature would " excite a hardcore minority of gamers " .
" formula 1 and similar complex simulation games are getting less mass market nowadays , compared to their more arcade-style heyday in the late 90s , " he told bbc news .
" this sort of feature would probably appeal to the hardcore gamer or f1 fan more than a mass market gamer .
" having said that , the hardcore would totally love it . "
bizarre creations is not currently one of the firms evaluating the system .
precision position at the core of iopener 's technology is an enhanced gps system known as differential gps -lrb- dgps -rrb- .
this uses a network of fixed base stations to correct the gps signal , which on its own may only be accurate to within 10m .
dgps is commonly used for air navigation or shipping where precision is key .
1 .
car position located with global navigation satellite systems 2 .
location data and car telemetry is beamed to a track side server 3 .
data is tagged with unique id of the car and sent over the internet 4 .
information stored on servers and " mediacast " to gamers .
whole process from car to gamer takes less than five seconds " with that we know the location and the velocity of the car , " explained mr lurling .
as further precision is needed , iopener can use information from the european egnos network , which augments gps satellite signals to provide positional data accurate to within 2m .
other tweaks include fitting cars with an inertial measurement unit -lrb- imu -rrb- , commonly used in guided missile systems , which measure acceleration , angle and yaw of the object .
" imus give accuracy on a short range , " mr lurling told bbc news .
" combined with dgps , we know the location of the car to within less than 30 centimetres . "
in addition , the system collects telemetry data from the car , which is fitted with a small computer , transmitter and the gps receiver .
" that is already good enough data for a game , " he said .
telemetry is commonly collected by track-side engineers to monitor the vehicles ' performance and can include information such as acceleration and what gear the car is in .
it has already used by games developers to build more realistic simulations .
designers at bizarre creations used the telemetry to generate accurate track models for early f1 games , before detailed circuit maps existed , for example .
from the track side , the data is sent over the net to a server farm , where it is saved before being pumped out - or " mediacast " - to eager gamers .
the delay between collecting the data and the gamer being immersed in it is up to five seconds , similar to the lag on a tv broadcast .
" we also store the data , so not only can you play the game in real time , but you can replay races at a later date , " said mr lurling .
intelligent gaming the company does not intend to develop its own games ; rather it will provide the backbone for games developers to build on to .
but it will provide some software ; specifically an artificial intelligence -lrb- ai -rrb- program to make sure that the virtual and real worlds blend seamlessly .
artificial intelligence handles collisions between real and virtual drivers " if hamilton is driving behind you he ca n't see you -lsb- in the game -rsb- , so he would drive right through you , " explained mr lurling .
" so the ai takes over at that point and you see a very realistic overtaking . "
the system also handles the results of in-game collisions between real and virtual drivers .
in this case , the real car always drives away .
the gamer 's fate is less certain .
" we go for optimal realism but the game experience has to be right , " he said .
mr wilson agrees with this approach .
" there is a huge difference between what happens in the real world and what happens in video games - even the most ' realistic ' simulator has to bend real world physics to make the game more fun , " he said .
however , even with the ai , he thinks gamers may encounter a more fundamental frustration with the system .
" i know i would n't even get close to the lap times that lewis hamilton could run , unless my car in the virtual world had a load of extra grip and power - which might defeat the point , " he said .
at the moment , iopener is concentrating firmly on racing games , but believes that there is a huge market for the system in other sports .
" you can think of biking , rowing , skiing and snowboarding , " said mr lurling .
" in the next three to five years , we believe that games will not be ' triple a ' games unless they have our feature in , " he said .
mr lurling was the 2006 dutch regional winner of the european satellite navigation competition -lrb- galileo masters -rrb- which aims to find novel uses for location data .
the 2008 competition is now open to entries , until 31 july .

driving the boundaries of realism he has already tested it with an f1 car and plans to have the first games on the market as early as september this year .
" at this point we have lots of interest and we are looking for the right partner to launch , " he said .
the firm is currently in talks with six developers about using the technology .
gareth wilson , design manager at bizarre creations , makers of the project gotham racing series , says he thinks games with the real-time feature would " excite a hardcore minority of gamers " .
" formula 1 and similar complex simulation games are getting less mass market nowadays , compared to their more arcade-style heyday in the late 90s , " he told bbc news .
" this sort of feature would probably appeal to the hardcore gamer or f1 fan more than a mass market gamer .
" having said that , the hardcore would totally love it . "
bizarre creations is not currently one of the firms evaluating the system .
precision position at the core of iopener 's technology is an enhanced gps system known as differential gps -lrb- dgps -rrb- .
this uses a network of fixed base stations to correct the gps signal , which on its own may only be accurate to within 10m .
dgps is commonly used for air navigation or shipping where precision is key .
1 .
car position located with global navigation satellite systems 2 .
location data and car telemetry is beamed to a track side server 3 .
data is tagged with unique id of the car and sent over the internet 4 .
information stored on servers and " mediacast " to gamers .
whole process from car to gamer takes less than five seconds " with that we know the location and the velocity of the car , " explained mr lurling .
as further precision is needed , iopener can use information from the european egnos network , which augments gps satellite signals to provide positional data accurate to within 2m .
other tweaks include fitting cars with an inertial measurement unit -lrb- imu -rrb- , commonly used in guided missile systems , which measure acceleration , angle and yaw of the object .
" imus give accuracy on a short range , " mr lurling told bbc news .
" combined with dgps , we know the location of the car to within less than 30 centimetres . "
in addition , the system collects telemetry data from the car , which is fitted with a small computer , transmitter and the gps receiver .
" that is already good enough data for a game , " he said .
telemetry is commonly collected by track-side engineers to monitor the vehicles ' performance and can include information such as acceleration and what gear the car is in .
it has already used by games developers to build more realistic simulations .
designers at bizarre creations used the telemetry to generate accurate track models for early f1 games , before detailed circuit maps existed , for example .
from the track side , the data is sent over the net to a server farm , where it is saved before being pumped out - or " mediacast " - to eager gamers .
the delay between collecting the data and the gamer being immersed in it is up to five seconds , similar to the lag on a tv broadcast .
" we also store the data , so not only can you play the game in real time , but you can replay races at a later date , " said mr lurling .
intelligent gaming the company does not intend to develop its own games ; rather it will provide the backbone for games developers to build on to .
but it will provide some software ; specifically an artificial intelligence -lrb- ai -rrb- program to make sure that the virtual and real worlds blend seamlessly .
artificial intelligence handles collisions between real and virtual drivers " if hamilton is driving behind you he ca n't see you -lsb- in the game -rsb- , so he would drive right through you , " explained mr lurling .
" so the ai takes over at that point and you see a very realistic overtaking . "
the system also handles the results of in-game collisions between real and virtual drivers .
in this case , the real car always drives away .
the gamer 's fate is less certain .
" we go for optimal realism but the game experience has to be right , " he said .
mr wilson agrees with this approach .
" there is a huge difference between what happens in the real world and what happens in video games - even the most ' realistic ' simulator has to bend real world physics to make the game more fun , " he said .
however , even with the ai , he thinks gamers may encounter a more fundamental frustration with the system .
" i know i would n't even get close to the lap times that lewis hamilton could run , unless my car in the virtual world had a load of extra grip and power - which might defeat the point , " he said .
at the moment , iopener is concentrating firmly on racing games , but believes that there is a huge market for the system in other sports .
" you can think of biking , rowing , skiing and snowboarding , " said mr lurling .
" in the next three to five years , we believe that games will not be ' triple a ' games unless they have our feature in , " he said .
mr lurling was the 2006 dutch regional winner of the european satellite navigation competition -lrb- galileo masters -rrb- which aims to find novel uses for location data .
the 2008 competition is now open to entries , until 31 july .

alongside you are top names like lewis hamilton , felipe massa and kimi raikkonen .
the cars ' engines are screaming and everyone is poised to go .
for any formula one fan the chance to race against their heroes would be a dream come true .
sadly , the closest most of us have ever got is watching the grand prix on television .
but that could soon change if a company from the netherlands has its way .
" it 's clear that the next trend in gaming is going to be bringing real objects into the virtual world ; playing not against other gamers but people doing the real thing , " said andy lurling , founder of iopener media .
the patented system his company is developing sucks in real-time gps data from racing events and pumps it out to compatible games consoles and pcs .
the idea is that you could pit yourself against the top drivers in the world , as it happens , from the comfort of your living room .
" you can compete against the best of the best , " he told bbc news .
' hardcore appeal ' and if all of this sounds far fetched , think again .

the scottish law commission said consenting sex between two children under 16 should not be prosecuted .
ministers will reject calls to end prosecutions but they are in favour of a more lenient approach .
bbc scotland political editor brian taylor believes ministers want most cases to be sent to a children 's panel hearing on welfare grounds .
the reformed law would reserve the right to prosecute where there were indications of predatory behaviour .
brian taylor said : " sex involving an adult and a young person under 16 would remain strictly illegal - and would be prosecuted .
" the issue here is consensual sex involving two youngsters under 16 .
" at present , only the boy is liable for prosecution .
" in practice , there are few court cases but even referral to the panel on offence grounds can result in a black mark on the youngster 's record which may ruin future job chances . "
he said ending prosecution was a step too far for ministers but they were prepared to compromise in certain cases .
maggie mellon of the charity children 1st told bbc radio scotland the issue was whether to " criminalise " children for having consenting sex .
she said : " there might be some circumstances where you would want to mark that this was a gross breach by one child of another child 's rights and safety .
" but mostly , under-age sex is between consenting young people , who have probably not been properly guided and have not been given proper adult supervision and support , who are in need of care and welfare rather than prosecution . "
gordon mcdonald , of the christian social policy group care , told bbc radio scotland children should be getting stronger guidance about sex from their parents .
" often parents abdicate their responsibility and leave it up to schools , health professionals and others , " he said .
" perhaps as a society we need to help parents more to have the tools to have these discussions with their children .
" although a lot of it comes down to the values in the family .
it is not just what you tell people explicitly , it is about the values and the stability of the family background . "

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- magazine -pipe- how offensive is the word ' pikey ' ?

by tom geoghegan bbc news magazine formula one commentator martin brundle is being investigated by media watchdog ofcom after using the term " pikeys " in a television broadcast .
but where does the word come from and how offensive is it ?
it 's a word very rarely heard on television .
in an interview with bernie ecclestone before sunday 's canadian grand prix in montreal , brundle referred to repairs being made to the track .
" there are some pikeys out there putting down new tarmac at turn 10 .
are they out of the way yet ? "
ofcom said it had received seven complaints and itv apologised to viewers .
brundle is n't the first media figure to be condemned for using the word , which is considered insulting by the traveller community .
the oed says it 's an offensive term last year on itv 's hell 's kitchen , chef marco pierre white said : " i do n't think it was a pikey 's picnic tonight . "
according to the oxford english dictionary , its first use in print was in the times in 1837 , referring to strangers who had come to the isle of sheppey island to harvest .
later that century it meant a " turnpike traveller " or vagabond .
but in more recent years it has become a term of abuse and in the eyes of the law using it can even be deemed a racist offence , given its association with irish travellers and roma gypsies .
in december , at lewes magistrates ' court , lee coleman , 28 , admitted using racially-aggravated threatening words and behaviour after a row with a nightclub manageress .
he had told her : " i 'm not paying you , pikey . "
badge of honour charlotte brewer , oxford university lexicographer , says the oed clearly labels it as an offensive term that came from the word " pike " meaning a road on which a toll is collected .
itv has apologised for brundle 's comments it did n't make the early editions of the oed at the start of the 20th century , which probably means it did not have any literary or newspapers sources at the time , although it was used .
however " piker " did get into the first edition , which meant much the same thing .
in 1955 , peter wildeblood , a champion of gay rights whose campaigning later helped decriminalise homosexuality , used the word as a badge of pride : " my family 's all pikeys , but we ai n't on the road no more . "
then it was a slang word , says ms brewer , but not necessarily an unpleasant or insulting one .
" but as we can see from the 2006 entry , the word seems to have come back into use more recently , and the oed editors use the words ' squalid , disreputable , vulgar ' to define it .
they are sure it is an insulting term . " .
this is the language of social discrimination and it 's quite shocking that this language is now being bandied about slang expert tony thorne there is no word more offensive to a traveller , says cliff codona , a roma gypsy and chairman of the national travellers action group .
" i 'm very proud of lewis hamilton .
it 's fantastic what he 's doing for the reputation of the country , absolutely outstanding .
" i would never think of calling that boy a certain derogatory word - that 's what ' pikey ' is to me and my community . "
he senses that it is gaining popularity as a term of abuse because people have realised how insulting it is .
slang expert tony thorne says " pikey " was being used as far back as the 16th century but has only become more offensive in the mainstream in the past four or five years .
" teenagers have been using it for the last few years to replace ' chav ' .
it 's used pejoratively as someone who is sub-proletariat like ' gypsy ' or ' gyppo ' was used in the 1940s and 50s . "
it used to be a word only used among country people who were speaking disapprovingly of a tramp .
social prejudice brundle probably thinks he can still use the word " pikey " in that innocent way , but his attitude is naive , says thorne , because it has become an insult and no-one would accept it as a description of themselves .
when used now in urban circles , it usually means a person is beyond the class system , someone without an identity who does n't matter , and is off the social radar , thorne suggests .
only in the villages is it likely to have retained its ethnic association with the traveller or gypsy community .
is " posh-bashing " just as bad ?
thorne detects its increased use as reflecting a period in which , post-political correctness , social prejudice is now more acceptable .
" the language of snobbishness and class distinction has come right back , with words like ' posh ' or ' pleb ' or ' prol ' , words i thought had disappeared in the late 60s .
" this is the language of social discrimination and it 's quite shocking that this language is now being bandied about .
it started with ' chav ' and then the ' posh ' stuff about david cameron and boris johnson . "
often these words are used by people who have always been prejudiced and nasty and who are now feeling they can safely express themselves again , he says , although this " petty snobbishness " has always been lurking below the surface of public debate .
but not everyone believes the word is quite so politically charged .
in his daily mail column , des kelly wrote : " to consider pikey a racial slur is as stupid as believing the word ' hippy ' has racist connotations , or that ' hoodie ' is offensive .
" ban pikey , and then you might as well outlaw chav , townie , trailer trash , hooray henry , goth , sloane , tinker and many more fairly innocuous labels . "
here is a selection of your comments .
i am irish living in the uk for the last 4 years and i have been called a " pikey " in the workplace .
it is an offensive word however in the instance of this report i do n't deem it to be offensive .
i do however take great offence when my colleague thinks its funny to win a debate he mutters the word " pikey " .
nina , northampton i agree that we need to preserve a sense of humour in the face of passing insults and not be so touchy .
i have my first experience , at 43 , of being called an ' old bag ' recently .
i guess i should just take it on the chin , both of them .
betty , uk i 'd never heard the term until it was used in the film snatch .
i 'd suggest that its use in this film may have helped to re-popularise it .
kev williams , york given that martin brundle lives in east anglia , i think it 's safe to say he was using it as a colloquial expression -lrb- and a humorous remark -rrb- and i agree with daily mirror columnist kelly that hippy and hoodie are similarly used .
hayley gilks , france in my high school in the late 1990s and early 2000s , ' pikey ' was used instead of ' chav ' - but unlike what tony thorne says , it seems to have actually preceded chav , at least in south-west london .
only recently has chav gained widespread acceptance .
further , it was n't the language of social discrimination but , if anything , cultural discrimination : my school was primarily middle-class , so those called ' pikeys ' were middle-class boys who spoke in what is now called ' jafaican , ' and behaved badly etc -lrb- like , as we would have said at middle-school , ' hard nuts ' - the inverted commas are purposefully used , because they thought they were so ' hard ' -rrb- .
outside of school , they would be identified due to wearing what are now deemed chav clothes , but part of the reason for calling these ' pikeys ' in a derogatory manner was that they were not dressing , speaking , and acting like that out of circumstance ; they purposefully did it to be cool .
it was both humourous and depressing .
james c , london , england to equate the word pikey with " the n-word " is to equate a dislike of the attitude and disruption caused to a society by some traveller groups with slavery and the historic treatment of some people as subhuman based on the race .
attitude like that is far more insulting that the naive use of a debatable term .
peter , luton peter from luton : do n't forget , the gypsies were treated as subhuman and were second only to the jews as subjects for extermination in ww2 europe .
so they may well be sensitive to a perceived growth in prejudice .
mike , london am i the only one on here who considers the use of this word extremely offensive ! ?
we all know that it is a derogatory term and we are in an advanced enough age where political correctness is a co-requisite for a civilised society , it is certainly not " madness " .
i think it is correct that this underhand comment should be investigated and appropriate action taken !
danny , blackpool all i want to say to the seven people who phoned in to complain is get a life .
there are far more important things affecting us now than the need to send politically correct officials out running around like headless chickens investigating a man who in all honesty meant nothing offensive .
michael clark , chesham i live in mitcham , south london .
we have always had a large " gypsy " population and as a child in the sixties i played with a large local family of " gypsys " .
one of the grans told me that the name pikey was a term for the ones that used to steal the pike kept for food by the monks of merton abbey .
she also told me of the hawks they would keep to pull down the doves and pigeons they also kept and that to get caught doing either was a very serious offence as the birds were protected .
gerry , mitcham how much more are we going to allow the ' pc ' brigade to restrict our freedoms .
i watched the program and the use of the word was not , in my opinion , intended to be derogatory or insulting .
it must be very difficult when conducting live unscripted interviews and this is one more example of how ridiculous things are becoming .
mike smith , huntingdon , cambs one problem with des kelly 's list of examples ; i 'm quite happy to be called a goth - even if i do n't have the hair for it nowadays .
being called a greebo is another matter ...
warren , reading , uk another example of political correctness gone mad .
it is n't the word itself that is offensive , but how it is used , in what context and in what manner .
we are all aware that ' travellers ' have a reputation for laying tarmac , and it was obviously used in connection to this in a light hearted manner .
it seem that certain people within minorities will travel a long way to be offended .
grow a thicker skin , develop a sense of humour and encourage people to break their stereotype behaviours .
andy , overseas i do n't have the slightest interest in the racial origins of the people it is applied to , only in the way they behave .
not allowing any form of insult is an attack against free speech , and the start of mind control .
mike farnden , ringwood delighted to hear that this kind of language is finally being recognised for the offensive term it is .
it was becoming far too mainstream and acceptable .
eva , glasgow ' pikey ' is a word that has been fairly frequently heard for some years now within the middle-class world i live in .
generally , it seems to be used and received as a mildly humorous insult , used in a context which intends no hostility towards travellers .
i 've never really perceived it to be any more offensive than calling something or someone ' gay ' -lrb- the use of ' gay ' as a form of insult in recent times having been previously covered by these pages -rrb- allan moore , chippenham i have been called " pikey " many times because of my name and i am not bothered in the slightest .
however i can understand that " pikey " used as slang for irish " travellers " could be mildly insulting , as mildly insulting as calling someone " posh " !
irish travellers are a proud and tough community who can give as good as they might get and i am sure they have their own names for those who do not travel and live in their own houses .
nigel arpike , aylesbury the term pikey has been used in the same context as the word " chav " for at least eight years in my memory - it sums up the tracksuit wearing , peaked cap-to-the-sky " elite " that seem to create the stereotypes given to teenagers .
if it affects the romani and offends them , then i do n't personally believe they are truly romani .
saying that however , i 'm sure it could be seen in the same context as the word " nomadi " in italian , which , for all rights and purposes has the same effect .
a vincent , portsmouth i think the british sense of humour needs to win out over the pc brigade and we need a little more common sense , there are far more important things going on in the world to waste column inches on this .
i guess this may well turn into the media led witch hunt that it normally does .
perhaps we could have the same witch hunt against the many hedge fund owners who are trying to bankrupt us all as we speak ! !

by tom geoghegan bbc news magazine formula one commentator martin brundle is being investigated by media watchdog ofcom after using the term " pikeys " in a television broadcast .
but where does the word come from and how offensive is it ?
it 's a word very rarely heard on television .
in an interview with bernie ecclestone before sunday 's canadian grand prix in montreal , brundle referred to repairs being made to the track .
" there are some pikeys out there putting down new tarmac at turn 10 .
are they out of the way yet ? "
ofcom said it had received seven complaints and itv apologised to viewers .
brundle is n't the first media figure to be condemned for using the word , which is considered insulting by the traveller community .
the oed says it 's an offensive term last year on itv 's hell 's kitchen , chef marco pierre white said : " i do n't think it was a pikey 's picnic tonight . "
according to the oxford english dictionary , its first use in print was in the times in 1837 , referring to strangers who had come to the isle of sheppey island to harvest .
later that century it meant a " turnpike traveller " or vagabond .
but in more recent years it has become a term of abuse and in the eyes of the law using it can even be deemed a racist offence , given its association with irish travellers and roma gypsies .
in december , at lewes magistrates ' court , lee coleman , 28 , admitted using racially-aggravated threatening words and behaviour after a row with a nightclub manageress .
he had told her : " i 'm not paying you , pikey . "
badge of honour charlotte brewer , oxford university lexicographer , says the oed clearly labels it as an offensive term that came from the word " pike " meaning a road on which a toll is collected .
itv has apologised for brundle 's comments it did n't make the early editions of the oed at the start of the 20th century , which probably means it did not have any literary or newspapers sources at the time , although it was used .
however " piker " did get into the first edition , which meant much the same thing .
in 1955 , peter wildeblood , a champion of gay rights whose campaigning later helped decriminalise homosexuality , used the word as a badge of pride : " my family 's all pikeys , but we ai n't on the road no more . "

when used now in urban circles , it usually means a person is beyond the class system , someone without an identity who does n't matter , and is off the social radar , thorne suggests .
only in the villages is it likely to have retained its ethnic association with the traveller or gypsy community .
is " posh-bashing " just as bad ?
thorne detects its increased use as reflecting a period in which , post-political correctness , social prejudice is now more acceptable .
" the language of snobbishness and class distinction has come right back , with words like ' posh ' or ' pleb ' or ' prol ' , words i thought had disappeared in the late 60s .
" this is the language of social discrimination and it 's quite shocking that this language is now being bandied about .
it started with ' chav ' and then the ' posh ' stuff about david cameron and boris johnson . "
often these words are used by people who have always been prejudiced and nasty and who are now feeling they can safely express themselves again , he says , although this " petty snobbishness " has always been lurking below the surface of public debate .
but not everyone believes the word is quite so politically charged .
in his daily mail column , des kelly wrote : " to consider pikey a racial slur is as stupid as believing the word ' hippy ' has racist connotations , or that ' hoodie ' is offensive .
" ban pikey , and then you might as well outlaw chav , townie , trailer trash , hooray henry , goth , sloane , tinker and many more fairly innocuous labels . "
here is a selection of your comments .
i am irish living in the uk for the last 4 years and i have been called a " pikey " in the workplace .
it is an offensive word however in the instance of this report i do n't deem it to be offensive .
i do however take great offence when my colleague thinks its funny to win a debate he mutters the word " pikey " .
nina , northampton i agree that we need to preserve a sense of humour in the face of passing insults and not be so touchy .
i have my first experience , at 43 , of being called an ' old bag ' recently .
i guess i should just take it on the chin , both of them .
betty , uk i 'd never heard the term until it was used in the film snatch .
i 'd suggest that its use in this film may have helped to re-popularise it .
kev williams , york given that martin brundle lives in east anglia , i think it 's safe to say he was using it as a colloquial expression -lrb- and a humorous remark -rrb- and i agree with daily mirror columnist kelly that hippy and hoodie are similarly used .
hayley gilks , france in my high school in the late 1990s and early 2000s , ' pikey ' was used instead of ' chav ' - but unlike what tony thorne says , it seems to have actually preceded chav , at least in south-west london .
only recently has chav gained widespread acceptance .
further , it was n't the language of social discrimination but , if anything , cultural discrimination : my school was primarily middle-class , so those called ' pikeys ' were middle-class boys who spoke in what is now called ' jafaican , ' and behaved badly etc -lrb- like , as we would have said at middle-school , ' hard nuts ' - the inverted commas are purposefully used , because they thought they were so ' hard ' -rrb- .
outside of school , they would be identified due to wearing what are now deemed chav clothes , but part of the reason for calling these ' pikeys ' in a derogatory manner was that they were not dressing , speaking , and acting like that out of circumstance ; they purposefully did it to be cool .
it was both humourous and depressing .
james c , london , england to equate the word pikey with " the n-word " is to equate a dislike of the attitude and disruption caused to a society by some traveller groups with slavery and the historic treatment of some people as subhuman based on the race .
attitude like that is far more insulting that the naive use of a debatable term .
peter , luton peter from luton : do n't forget , the gypsies were treated as subhuman and were second only to the jews as subjects for extermination in ww2 europe .
so they may well be sensitive to a perceived growth in prejudice .
mike , london am i the only one on here who considers the use of this word extremely offensive ! ?
we all know that it is a derogatory term and we are in an advanced enough age where political correctness is a co-requisite for a civilised society , it is certainly not " madness " .
i think it is correct that this underhand comment should be investigated and appropriate action taken !
danny , blackpool all i want to say to the seven people who phoned in to complain is get a life .
there are far more important things affecting us now than the need to send politically correct officials out running around like headless chickens investigating a man who in all honesty meant nothing offensive .
michael clark , chesham i live in mitcham , south london .
we have always had a large " gypsy " population and as a child in the sixties i played with a large local family of " gypsys " .
one of the grans told me that the name pikey was a term for the ones that used to steal the pike kept for food by the monks of merton abbey .
she also told me of the hawks they would keep to pull down the doves and pigeons they also kept and that to get caught doing either was a very serious offence as the birds were protected .
gerry , mitcham how much more are we going to allow the ' pc ' brigade to restrict our freedoms .
i watched the program and the use of the word was not , in my opinion , intended to be derogatory or insulting .
it must be very difficult when conducting live unscripted interviews and this is one more example of how ridiculous things are becoming .
mike smith , huntingdon , cambs one problem with des kelly 's list of examples ; i 'm quite happy to be called a goth - even if i do n't have the hair for it nowadays .
being called a greebo is another matter ...
warren , reading , uk another example of political correctness gone mad .
it is n't the word itself that is offensive , but how it is used , in what context and in what manner .
we are all aware that ' travellers ' have a reputation for laying tarmac , and it was obviously used in connection to this in a light hearted manner .
it seem that certain people within minorities will travel a long way to be offended .
grow a thicker skin , develop a sense of humour and encourage people to break their stereotype behaviours .
andy , overseas i do n't have the slightest interest in the racial origins of the people it is applied to , only in the way they behave .
not allowing any form of insult is an attack against free speech , and the start of mind control .
mike farnden , ringwood delighted to hear that this kind of language is finally being recognised for the offensive term it is .
it was becoming far too mainstream and acceptable .
eva , glasgow ' pikey ' is a word that has been fairly frequently heard for some years now within the middle-class world i live in .
generally , it seems to be used and received as a mildly humorous insult , used in a context which intends no hostility towards travellers .
i 've never really perceived it to be any more offensive than calling something or someone ' gay ' -lrb- the use of ' gay ' as a form of insult in recent times having been previously covered by these pages -rrb- allan moore , chippenham i have been called " pikey " many times because of my name and i am not bothered in the slightest .
however i can understand that " pikey " used as slang for irish " travellers " could be mildly insulting , as mildly insulting as calling someone " posh " !
irish travellers are a proud and tough community who can give as good as they might get and i am sure they have their own names for those who do not travel and live in their own houses .
nigel arpike , aylesbury the term pikey has been used in the same context as the word " chav " for at least eight years in my memory - it sums up the tracksuit wearing , peaked cap-to-the-sky " elite " that seem to create the stereotypes given to teenagers .
if it affects the romani and offends them , then i do n't personally believe they are truly romani .
saying that however , i 'm sure it could be seen in the same context as the word " nomadi " in italian , which , for all rights and purposes has the same effect .
a vincent , portsmouth i think the british sense of humour needs to win out over the pc brigade and we need a little more common sense , there are far more important things going on in the world to waste column inches on this .
i guess this may well turn into the media led witch hunt that it normally does .
perhaps we could have the same witch hunt against the many hedge fund owners who are trying to bankrupt us all as we speak ! !

by tom geoghegan bbc news magazine formula one commentator martin brundle is being investigated by media watchdog ofcom after using the term " pikeys " in a television broadcast .
but where does the word come from and how offensive is it ?
it 's a word very rarely heard on television .
in an interview with bernie ecclestone before sunday 's canadian grand prix in montreal , brundle referred to repairs being made to the track .
" there are some pikeys out there putting down new tarmac at turn 10 .
are they out of the way yet ? "
ofcom said it had received seven complaints and itv apologised to viewers .
brundle is n't the first media figure to be condemned for using the word , which is considered insulting by the traveller community .
the oed says it 's an offensive term last year on itv 's hell 's kitchen , chef marco pierre white said : " i do n't think it was a pikey 's picnic tonight . "
according to the oxford english dictionary , its first use in print was in the times in 1837 , referring to strangers who had come to the isle of sheppey island to harvest .
later that century it meant a " turnpike traveller " or vagabond .
but in more recent years it has become a term of abuse and in the eyes of the law using it can even be deemed a racist offence , given its association with irish travellers and roma gypsies .
in december , at lewes magistrates ' court , lee coleman , 28 , admitted using racially-aggravated threatening words and behaviour after a row with a nightclub manageress .
he had told her : " i 'm not paying you , pikey . "
badge of honour charlotte brewer , oxford university lexicographer , says the oed clearly labels it as an offensive term that came from the word " pike " meaning a road on which a toll is collected .
itv has apologised for brundle 's comments it did n't make the early editions of the oed at the start of the 20th century , which probably means it did not have any literary or newspapers sources at the time , although it was used .
however " piker " did get into the first edition , which meant much the same thing .
in 1955 , peter wildeblood , a champion of gay rights whose campaigning later helped decriminalise homosexuality , used the word as a badge of pride : " my family 's all pikeys , but we ai n't on the road no more . "
then it was a slang word , says ms brewer , but not necessarily an unpleasant or insulting one .
" but as we can see from the 2006 entry , the word seems to have come back into use more recently , and the oed editors use the words ' squalid , disreputable , vulgar ' to define it .
they are sure it is an insulting term . " .
this is the language of social discrimination and it 's quite shocking that this language is now being bandied about slang expert tony thorne there is no word more offensive to a traveller , says cliff codona , a roma gypsy and chairman of the national travellers action group .
" i 'm very proud of lewis hamilton .
it 's fantastic what he 's doing for the reputation of the country , absolutely outstanding .
" i would never think of calling that boy a certain derogatory word - that 's what ' pikey ' is to me and my community . "
he senses that it is gaining popularity as a term of abuse because people have realised how insulting it is .
slang expert tony thorne says " pikey " was being used as far back as the 16th century but has only become more offensive in the mainstream in the past four or five years .
" teenagers have been using it for the last few years to replace ' chav ' .
it 's used pejoratively as someone who is sub-proletariat like ' gypsy ' or ' gyppo ' was used in the 1940s and 50s . "
it used to be a word only used among country people who were speaking disapprovingly of a tramp .
social prejudice brundle probably thinks he can still use the word " pikey " in that innocent way , but his attitude is naive , says thorne , because it has become an insult and no-one would accept it as a description of themselves .
when used now in urban circles , it usually means a person is beyond the class system , someone without an identity who does n't matter , and is off the social radar , thorne suggests .
only in the villages is it likely to have retained its ethnic association with the traveller or gypsy community .
is " posh-bashing " just as bad ?

mr wheeler said a vote was promised and " fair play " meant it should be held .
prime minister gordon brown says the treaty does not have the constitutional implications to merit a referendum .
lord justice richards confirmed that , as expected , judgement was being reserved - but promised a decision " as soon as possible " . "
the government promised a referendum and should keep its promise " rabindher singh qc stuart wheeler 's counsel on the second day of the case clive lewis qc , for the commons speaker michael martin , said that parliamentary privilege prevented a court from ordering mps or ministers to introduce bills .
he said there was a natural division between the realms of law and politics and that mr wheeler 's complaint fell within the realm of politics .
on monday , rabindher singh qc , counsel for mr wheeler , told the high court the tory donor had a " legitimate expectation " there would be a public vote .
" the government promised a referendum and should keep its promise , " he said .
at stake were the fundamental principles of " good administration , fair play and straight dealing with the public " .
mr singh said ex-prime minister tony blair had promised a referendum prior to the ratification of the constitutional treaty , which came to nothing after plans for an eu constitution were rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
that promise had given rise to " a procedural legitimate expectation that a referendum would be held in respect of that treaty - and by implication any treaty containing substantially similar terms , whatever its name " .
' policing politics ' ?
lord justice richards and mr justice mackay were told the evidence showed that the subsequent lisbon treaty and the constitutional treaty were all but the same , except in name - a charge rejected by the office of the prime minister 's counsel .
but mr brown had unlawfully failed to honour the government 's promise of a referendum , mr singh said .
however , lord justice richards asked " about the extent to which the courts can become involved in policing the political process " .
mr singh argued that the courts " in the last 25 years have never shrunk from addressing and answering the crucial question as to whether there was an error of law disclosed to the court " .
but jonathan sumption qc , appearing for the office of the prime minister , asked the court to reject mr wheeler 's case claiming it was " politics dressed up as law " .
irish vote if mr singh 's argument was accepted , judges could become involved in a range of political issues where assurances had been given to the electorate at large " including those to reduce the burden of taxation , improve educational standards , half class sizes , double the size of the navy or whatever you would like " , he said .
the two-day review was heard as voters in ireland , the only eu state holding a referendum , prepare to go to the polls on thursday .
the treaty , which paves the way for greater european integration , an eu presidency and the abolition of a host of national vetoes , will effectively be killed off if ireland votes " no " as it must be passed unanimously by all 27 states .
in march , mps in the house of commons voted by 346 votes to 206 to approve the eu -lrb- amendment -rrb- bill .
the bill - now in the lords - will ratify the lisbon treaty , which was drawn up to replace the eu constitution after that was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
row over lib dems shadow foreign secretary william hague has written to lib dem leader nick clegg asking him to clarify his party 's position on the lisbon treaty .
it comes after lib dem mps were ordered to abstain on the vote on a referendum in the commons , yet the leader of his party in the lords has indicated that peers there will be whipped to oppose it .
in his letter , mr hague asked mr clegg if he had " lost control " over his party .
" or is it because your real objective is to see the lisbon treaty in force at all costs before the british people have a chance to have their say ? "
the house of lords is due to vote on calls for a referendum on wednesday .
