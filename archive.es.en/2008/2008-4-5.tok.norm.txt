still , airliners say there is room onboard . as the us dollar has fallen over past months , many airlines have seen their passenger numbers on trans-atlantic routes rise . compared to this time last year , seat occupancy rates have risen from 80 percent to 88 percent , werner claasen , spokesman for united airlines in frankfurt , told the german dpa news service . delta airlines , lufthansa , air berlin and klm / northwest have reported similar figures , dpa noted . but , in a survey conducted by the news agency , travelers can still secure a space for flying to the united states from europe during summer months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : travelers can still find a spot on tran-atlantic routes this summer , airliners say according to the visit usa committee , 1.5 million people traveled to the us from germany alone in 2007 .
but , while the number of passengers traveling from europe continues to increase , the number of us citizens flying to the european continent has remained the same . business travelers have also contributed to keeping passenger figures relatively constant , the organization said . up , up and away while discounter airline air berlin told dpa that " there are still some discount seats available between dusseldorf and new york , " even seats at normal prices are quickly filling up on the airline 's other routes . german airline lufthansa said only its low-cost seats are completely booked out , and travelers can still find inexpensive last-minute economy class tickets as long as they are not around the holidays , claasen added . other carriers still have free capacity to the popular destinations such as new york , los angeles , san francisco and miami , dpa reported . still , while rising fuel costs are having an affect , claasen said the increased demand is not forcing prices up due to stiff competition between the airlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt : one of europe 's busiest airports anke guenther , a tour operator at dertour in frankfurt , which specializes in travel to the us , said even as early as march , her company had registered an 18-percent increase in bookings compared to last year . ever more flights to the us despite the terrorist attacks of on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 05.04.2008 berlin art upgrades from sexy to sophisticated großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin biennial has established itself on the city 's packed arts calendar the berlin biennial is designed to consolidate the city 's status as a fertile breeding ground for avant garde art .
but cultivating creativity is one thing - getting buyers to spend is another matter . berlin played a key role in european art throughout the 20th century , spawning generations of avant-garde artists and inspiring many of the revolutionary movements that shaped the art world in the last 100 years .
but although the city was traditionally a magnet for artists in the first half of the 20th century , its 40-year division left it out in the cold until reunification in 1990 , existing wholly outside of the commercial world and completely cut off from international contacts and influences .
in subsequent years , low rents and the heady atmosphere of change made it once again attractive to creative types who helped put it - slowly but surely - back on the art map .
so when it comes to numbers of artists and galleries , the city 's art industry has long been competing with london and new york .
but while there are some 450 galleries in the city - authorities estimate that one new gallery opens each week - there 's relatively little international money being spent here .
mayor klaus wowereit made a virtue of neccessity when he dubbed the city " poor but sexy , " but the reality is that the city would be thrilled if its much-touted arts and culture could also bring home the bacon .
the last decade has seen a clutch of major art fairs do their bit to entice out-of-town investors , including the annual art forum , founded in 1995 , the berlin biennial in 2003 and the annual gallery weekend launched in 2005 .
biennial bonanza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new nationalgalerie is one of the biennial 's venues the 5th berlin biennial for contemporary art , entitled " when things cast no shadow " and curated by adam szymczyk and elena filipovic , started luring the art world 's glitterati to the capital as of friday , april 5 .
the event will comprise two parts , day and night .
during the day , artworks and specially commissioned projects will be on view at three main venues , selected for their cultural significance as well as for their political and economic contexts .
they range from established galleries to al fresco makeshift museums . each venue offers a very different type of exhibition space , with distinctive conditions and frameworks for the artists , artworks , and viewers .
during the night , the exhibition will continue in the form of diverse events held in widely different sites throughout the city every evening .
the lure of the hauptstadt using the city as a complement to the art being showcased is characteristic of the contemporary scene .
" berlin has an urban charm that is n't only about art , " said klaus gerrit friese , president of the german association of german galleries .
" a city that plays host to key events , be they political , social or artistic , will always attract plenty of international artists . "
thomas schulte , another berlin gallery owner , noted in the international herald tribune last month that the german capital has a history of attracting foreign artists that dates back to the 1920s .
" its geographical position stimulates various cultural exchanges between the east and the west , " he said , pointing out that the tradition was brutally interrupted by the rise of nazism , world war ii and the partition of germany .
paying off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work by german artist thomas demand is snapped up by collectors but according to martin mertens , a gallery owner and art historian , berlin 's main appeal is precisely that it has trodden a new unique path that set its apart from the glitzier and more commercial art being peddled on london 's cork street or in new york 's soho .
" most of the international artists have moved to berlin because apartments and studios are still relatively cheap , " he said .
he pays 400 euros -lrb- $ 625 -rrb- a month for his gallery space on the brunnenstrasse , a street on the outskirts of the gentrified mitte neighborhood , currently billed as the hippest art avenue in town - and said he could never dream of such a low rent in london or paris .
friese is confident that the buzz will soon start to pay off .
" we 're hoping to see the emergence of a collectorship on the same scale as in cologne -lsb- the commercial center of the german art scene -rsb- , " he said .
" let 's wait five years , then we 'll see a change in the figures . "
he predicted that it wo n't be long before the cash starts to flow , and said a number of well-heeled collectors are moving to berlin - including christian boros , the hoffmanns , axel haubrock and wilhelm schuermann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 05.04.2008 germany celebrates 100 years of international soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-match beers and reticent fans marked germany 's international debut in 1908 one hundred years have passed since the german national soccer team took to the field in basel to play switzerland in its first competitive international game - but it might as well be a million . around 3,500 spectators turned out to see germany 's fledgling eagles take on switzerland on april 5 , 1908 , a fraction of those who now regularly support the national team on away matches .
the atmosphere was also light years away from today 's regularly raucous celebrations .
spectators at the landhof ground were told to refrain from making loud calls and female fans were treated to complimentary chocolates . the swiss , who had played their first game as a national team three years earlier , ran out 5-3 winners after 19-year-old fritz becker had opened the scoring for germany to become his nation 's first ever international goal scorer . fast forward to march 26 , 2008 and 38,500 rowdy spectators watched germany 's return to basel in their 800th game , where current coach joachim loew 's visitors trounced the home side 4-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 years on , germany exacted revenge in basel instead of sharing a few beers with the opposition before the game as was the case in 1908 , the germans spent the pre-match preparations in the company of their team of doctors , sports psychologists , physiotherapists , media specialists and even own their own cooks . pre-match boozing , free sweets for the ladies and reticent fans have long been consigned to the history books , along with germany 's early habit of losing too many consecutive matches . after the first game and defeat , germany waited over a year for their first victory , a 1-0 revenge win over the swiss in karlsruhe .
since then , while there have been losses - and thrashings , the largest being a 9-0 reverse against england two weeks before the national team 's first win - germany has built a reputation for well-disciplined success , even when not playing particularly well . germans cut from a different cloth " all germans come from the same factory , presumably the ironworks , " argentina 's world cup-winning coach cesar luis menotti once noted , commenting on the resilience of a long list of legendary players who never gave up and who are responsible in part for building a soccer legacy over the past 100 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz walter , one of the 1954 world cup winners players such as franz beckenbauer , uwe seeler , fritz walter , top scorer gerd mueller and lothar matthaeus , germany 's most-capped star , have come to epitomize the teutonic spirit that was forged in those early forays on the international scene and which eventually brought the national team world cup titles in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 as well as european championship triumphs in 1972 , 1980 and 1996 . as well as success in international tournaments , germany has been involved in some of the most memorable landmark matches in soccer history : a 3-2 triumph over hungary in the 1954 world cup final , the 1966 final they lost 4-2 against england , the heroic battle with italy they lost 4-3 in the 1970 semi-finals . germany also won the first penalty shoot-out at a world cup , against france in the 1982 semis .
fourteen years later germany also won the first major championship final decided by a golden goal , at euro 1996 over the czech republic . dfb celebrates a successful run germany have won 457 of the 800 matches played so far , with 164 draws and 179 defeats .
german teams scored 1,782 goals and conceded 965 .
in addition , an east german national team played 293 matches between 1952 and 1990 - famously beating west germany 1-0 at the 1974 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer 's 1990 world cup-winning team " we 've had quite a successful run , " german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger told the federation 's web site .
" just think about which accomplishments were triggered by soccer in germany , especially following world war ii .
soccer always moved the people living here , whether because of the many major triumphs or defeats .
we have really had an incredible journey . " consistency has always been a part of germany 's century of success .
the national team has only had 10 coaches in its 100 years of international competition , the legendary sepp herberger being the longest-serving .
the coach of the " heroes of bern " - germany 's first world cup winners in 1954 - held the post for 28 years .
his successors held tenures of ever-shortening length ; the last manager to leave office , juergen klinsmann , lasting just two years in another sign of how times have changed . team and federation grows together it has n't been just the national team which has developed into a success over the last 100 years .
the dfb was founded eight years before the national team was created but has enjoyed remarkable success in tandem with it over the past century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer in germany has exploded in the last century " obviously the dfb has grown in the last 100 years , " said thomas hackbarth , director of communications at the dfb .
" it is now one of the biggest sporting associations in europe , employing over 200 people across 21 regional offices and boasting 6.5 million members .
these are people who are or who have been actively involved with german soccer , both in a professional and amateur capacity . " another huge development in the last 100 years is the growth of women 's soccer and the dfb now has over 1 million female members , " hackbarth added .
" this is one of the reasons the 2011 women 's world cup was awarded to germany because the growth in the women 's game here has been phenomenal . " a century of organizational progress aside from the on-field success , germany and the dfb have become synonymous with preparatory perfection in the world of soccer .
as the game has developed over the last 100 years , both the team and the organization behind it have adapted to a changing landscape , culminating in the hugely successful hosting of the 2006 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " fan mile " was a landmark in world cup evolution " the 2006 world cup was a great success , not just with the national team 's performance , but the whole event , " hackbarth said .
" the dfb proved that it could handle the organization of such a massive event and create an atmosphere of inclusion , humor and safety . " the 2006 world cup was unrecognizable from the first world cup germany participated in 1934 , " he added .

the atmosphere was also light years away from today 's regularly raucous celebrations .
spectators at the landhof ground were told to refrain from making loud calls and female fans were treated to complimentary chocolates . the swiss , who had played their first game as a national team three years earlier , ran out 5-3 winners after 19-year-old fritz becker had opened the scoring for germany to become his nation 's first ever international goal scorer . fast forward to march 26 , 2008 and 38,500 rowdy spectators watched germany 's return to basel in their 800th game , where current coach joachim loew 's visitors trounced the home side 4-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 years on , germany exacted revenge in basel instead of sharing a few beers with the opposition before the game as was the case in 1908 , the germans spent the pre-match preparations in the company of their team of doctors , sports psychologists , physiotherapists , media specialists and even own their own cooks . pre-match boozing , free sweets for the ladies and reticent fans have long been consigned to the history books , along with germany 's early habit of losing too many consecutive matches . after the first game and defeat , germany waited over a year for their first victory , a 1-0 revenge win over the swiss in karlsruhe .
since then , while there have been losses - and thrashings , the largest being a 9-0 reverse against england two weeks before the national team 's first win - germany has built a reputation for well-disciplined success , even when not playing particularly well . germans cut from a different cloth " all germans come from the same factory , presumably the ironworks , " argentina 's world cup-winning coach cesar luis menotti once noted , commenting on the resilience of a long list of legendary players who never gave up and who are responsible in part for building a soccer legacy over the past 100 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz walter , one of the 1954 world cup winners players such as franz beckenbauer , uwe seeler , fritz walter , top scorer gerd mueller and lothar matthaeus , germany 's most-capped star , have come to epitomize the teutonic spirit that was forged in those early forays on the international scene and which eventually brought the national team world cup titles in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 as well as european championship triumphs in 1972 , 1980 and 1996 . as well as success in international tournaments , germany has been involved in some of the most memorable landmark matches in soccer history : a 3-2 triumph over hungary in the 1954 world cup final , the 1966 final they lost 4-2 against england , the heroic battle with italy they lost 4-3 in the 1970 semi-finals . germany also won the first penalty shoot-out at a world cup , against france in the 1982 semis .
fourteen years later germany also won the first major championship final decided by a golden goal , at euro 1996 over the czech republic . dfb celebrates a successful run germany have won 457 of the 800 matches played so far , with 164 draws and 179 defeats .
german teams scored 1,782 goals and conceded 965 .
in addition , an east german national team played 293 matches between 1952 and 1990 - famously beating west germany 1-0 at the 1974 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer 's 1990 world cup-winning team " we 've had quite a successful run , " german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger told the federation 's web site .
" just think about which accomplishments were triggered by soccer in germany , especially following world war ii .
soccer always moved the people living here , whether because of the many major triumphs or defeats .
we have really had an incredible journey . " consistency has always been a part of germany 's century of success .
the national team has only had 10 coaches in its 100 years of international competition , the legendary sepp herberger being the longest-serving .
the coach of the " heroes of bern " - germany 's first world cup winners in 1954 - held the post for 28 years .
his successors held tenures of ever-shortening length ; the last manager to leave office , juergen klinsmann , lasting just two years in another sign of how times have changed . team and federation grows together it has n't been just the national team which has developed into a success over the last 100 years .
the dfb was founded eight years before the national team was created but has enjoyed remarkable success in tandem with it over the past century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer in germany has exploded in the last century " obviously the dfb has grown in the last 100 years , " said thomas hackbarth , director of communications at the dfb .
" it is now one of the biggest sporting associations in europe , employing over 200 people across 21 regional offices and boasting 6.5 million members .
these are people who are or who have been actively involved with german soccer , both in a professional and amateur capacity . " another huge development in the last 100 years is the growth of women 's soccer and the dfb now has over 1 million female members , " hackbarth added .
" this is one of the reasons the 2011 women 's world cup was awarded to germany because the growth in the women 's game here has been phenomenal . " a century of organizational progress aside from the on-field success , germany and the dfb have become synonymous with preparatory perfection in the world of soccer .
as the game has developed over the last 100 years , both the team and the organization behind it have adapted to a changing landscape , culminating in the hugely successful hosting of the 2006 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " fan mile " was a landmark in world cup evolution " the 2006 world cup was a great success , not just with the national team 's performance , but the whole event , " hackbarth said .
" the dfb proved that it could handle the organization of such a massive event and create an atmosphere of inclusion , humor and safety . " the 2006 world cup was unrecognizable from the first world cup germany participated in 1934 , " he added .

the atmosphere was also light years away from today 's regularly raucous celebrations .
spectators at the landhof ground were told to refrain from making loud calls and female fans were treated to complimentary chocolates . the swiss , who had played their first game as a national team three years earlier , ran out 5-3 winners after 19-year-old fritz becker had opened the scoring for germany to become his nation 's first ever international goal scorer . fast forward to march 26 , 2008 and 38,500 rowdy spectators watched germany 's return to basel in their 800th game , where current coach joachim loew 's visitors trounced the home side 4-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 years on , germany exacted revenge in basel instead of sharing a few beers with the opposition before the game as was the case in 1908 , the germans spent the pre-match preparations in the company of their team of doctors , sports psychologists , physiotherapists , media specialists and even own their own cooks . pre-match boozing , free sweets for the ladies and reticent fans have long been consigned to the history books , along with germany 's early habit of losing too many consecutive matches . after the first game and defeat , germany waited over a year for their first victory , a 1-0 revenge win over the swiss in karlsruhe .
since then , while there have been losses - and thrashings , the largest being a 9-0 reverse against england two weeks before the national team 's first win - germany has built a reputation for well-disciplined success , even when not playing particularly well . germans cut from a different cloth " all germans come from the same factory , presumably the ironworks , " argentina 's world cup-winning coach cesar luis menotti once noted , commenting on the resilience of a long list of legendary players who never gave up and who are responsible in part for building a soccer legacy over the past 100 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz walter , one of the 1954 world cup winners players such as franz beckenbauer , uwe seeler , fritz walter , top scorer gerd mueller and lothar matthaeus , germany 's most-capped star , have come to epitomize the teutonic spirit that was forged in those early forays on the international scene and which eventually brought the national team world cup titles in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 as well as european championship triumphs in 1972 , 1980 and 1996 . as well as success in international tournaments , germany has been involved in some of the most memorable landmark matches in soccer history : a 3-2 triumph over hungary in the 1954 world cup final , the 1966 final they lost 4-2 against england , the heroic battle with italy they lost 4-3 in the 1970 semi-finals . germany also won the first penalty shoot-out at a world cup , against france in the 1982 semis .
fourteen years later germany also won the first major championship final decided by a golden goal , at euro 1996 over the czech republic . dfb celebrates a successful run germany have won 457 of the 800 matches played so far , with 164 draws and 179 defeats .
german teams scored 1,782 goals and conceded 965 .
in addition , an east german national team played 293 matches between 1952 and 1990 - famously beating west germany 1-0 at the 1974 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer 's 1990 world cup-winning team " we 've had quite a successful run , " german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger told the federation 's web site .
" just think about which accomplishments were triggered by soccer in germany , especially following world war ii .
soccer always moved the people living here , whether because of the many major triumphs or defeats .
we have really had an incredible journey . " consistency has always been a part of germany 's century of success .
the national team has only had 10 coaches in its 100 years of international competition , the legendary sepp herberger being the longest-serving .
the coach of the " heroes of bern " - germany 's first world cup winners in 1954 - held the post for 28 years .
his successors held tenures of ever-shortening length ; the last manager to leave office , juergen klinsmann , lasting just two years in another sign of how times have changed . team and federation grows together it has n't been just the national team which has developed into a success over the last 100 years .
the dfb was founded eight years before the national team was created but has enjoyed remarkable success in tandem with it over the past century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer in germany has exploded in the last century " obviously the dfb has grown in the last 100 years , " said thomas hackbarth , director of communications at the dfb .
" it is now one of the biggest sporting associations in europe , employing over 200 people across 21 regional offices and boasting 6.5 million members .
these are people who are or who have been actively involved with german soccer , both in a professional and amateur capacity . " another huge development in the last 100 years is the growth of women 's soccer and the dfb now has over 1 million female members , " hackbarth added .
" this is one of the reasons the 2011 women 's world cup was awarded to germany because the growth in the women 's game here has been phenomenal . " a century of organizational progress aside from the on-field success , germany and the dfb have become synonymous with preparatory perfection in the world of soccer .
as the game has developed over the last 100 years , both the team and the organization behind it have adapted to a changing landscape , culminating in the hugely successful hosting of the 2006 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " fan mile " was a landmark in world cup evolution " the 2006 world cup was a great success , not just with the national team 's performance , but the whole event , " hackbarth said .
" the dfb proved that it could handle the organization of such a massive event and create an atmosphere of inclusion , humor and safety . " the 2006 world cup was unrecognizable from the first world cup germany participated in 1934 , " he added .
" maybe in the next 100 years , the same thing will be said about 2006 . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in a letter to fia president max mosley , the adac has distanced itself from events surrounding his person , " adac said . the 67-year-old son of former british fascist party leader oswald mosley , max mosley faces mounting pressure to resign ever since a british newspaper published raunchy details of his personal life . the british sunday newspaper news of the world alleged that mosley was involved in a nazi-style sex orgy with prostitutes in london last friday .

" it is in the interests of this world organization to carry on with its duties without the burden of this affair . " mosley denies nazi connotation mosley has not denied the incident took place , but insists there were no nazi overtones and he has done no wrong . mosley said he had written to adac , repeating an earlier statement that he would be suing the newspaper that published the story and posted the video on its website . the letter , parts of which were published on autosport.com , has been sent to all members of fia , as well as members of the world council for automobile mobility and tourism . he said that he would have resigned immediately had he been caught speeding or driving over the alcohol limit . " as it is , a scandal paper obtained by illegal means pictures of something i did in private which , although unacceptable to some people , was harmless and completely legal , " mosley said .
" it goes without saying that the so-called nazi element is pure fabrication .
this will become crystal clear when the matter comes to trial .

the event organized by the european trade union confederation -lrb- egb -rrb- drew between 10,000 and 30,000 protesters .
" this is a protest against the situation in the whole of europe , " reinhard dombre , head of germany 's trade union federation told reuters .
egb general secretary john monks said eu finance ministers and bankers had to understand the concerns of employees .
" we can not accept the sermons and lectures of european central bankers and finance ministers , " monks said .
" europe 's workers want their fair share . "
euro-zone finance ministers and central bankers , meeting for two days in slovenian town of brdo , warned on saturday that demands for big wage hikes could fuel a dangerous wage-inflation spiral .
the bundesbank , or german central bank , cautioned that recent hefty wage hikes in germany 's public sector would drive up the inflation rate , possibly forcing the bank to raise interest rates .
earlier this week german services union verdi - the biggest in the country - and public sector employers struck a deal on wage rises of around eight percent over two years for 1.3 million staff .
" enormous mistake to imitate germany " " the wage agreements are sharply higher than we expected , " bundesbank president axel weber told journalists . " we are going to have a close look at the -lsb- inflation -rsb- forecasts to see if public sector wage deals do n't make a revision necessary . "
weber added that those accords often set the tone for other pay negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's coup of an eight-percent pay hike has some finance experts alarmed " we are concerned about that , " he said , insisting that the german public sector was in a unique situation because it had gone without pay increases for several years .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet said the german public sector could not afford to serve as a model for other countries .
he stressed that wage development had to be in tandem with competitiveness and productivity of a country .
" a sensible wage policy is decisive for further growth in employment , " trichet said .
" it would be an enormous mistake to imitate germany . "
in the face of such inflation , euro-zone officials say that wage demands should not exceed productivity growth .
inflation at " incredible level " german finance minister peer steinbrueck however defended the strong pay rises in the public sector , saying the agreements followed job cuts and two years without net wage increases .
" employees have behaved very responsibly , they must have a share in the good economic development , " steinbrueck said .
jean-claude juncker , head of the euro zone countries finance ministers ' meetings , admitted that trade unions were right take into account inflation in their demands for higher wages , adding the weakest in society were hit the worst by price rises .
" those living on 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , 700 euros ca n't live with runaway inflation , " juncker said , adding that inflation was at an " incredible level . "
inflation in the 15 euro-zone countries jumped in march to 3.5 percent - the highest level since the bloc was formed in 1999 , according to official eu data earlier this week .
worst yet to come for beleaguered banks steinbrueck and weber , however , said the worst was yet to come for european banks reeling under the global financial crisis . banks can expect worse because " unlike last year they ca n't write down their losses against a very good first half year , " weber told news agency ap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche bank announced huge losses two of europe 's largest banks - swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank - recently announced massive first quarter losses .
steinbrueck warned that banks were still not honest enough about the effects of the global crisis .
" this is still not satisfactory , " steinbrueck said , adding that if banks intended to blame each other for financial woes they would end up in a tough situation .
germany can weather turmoil despite the banking turmoil , the german finance minister said he is sticking to his growth forecasts for the german economy in 2008 , even as the credit crisis dents global expansion .
" i think we can weather the financial turmoil to a wide extent , " steinbrueck said in an interview with bloomberg television .
" germany is going to face a growth rate of about 1.7 , 1.6 percent , " he said . the german economy is so far coping with the global slowdown caused by a us housing recession , a stronger euro and record oil prices .
investor , business and consumer confidence all unexpectedly increased last month and unemployment fell to the lowest in more than 15 years .

the event organized by the european trade union confederation -lrb- egb -rrb- drew between 10,000 and 30,000 protesters .
" this is a protest against the situation in the whole of europe , " reinhard dombre , head of germany 's trade union federation told reuters .

" europe 's workers want their fair share . "
euro-zone finance ministers and central bankers , meeting for two days in slovenian town of brdo , warned on saturday that demands for big wage hikes could fuel a dangerous wage-inflation spiral .
the bundesbank , or german central bank , cautioned that recent hefty wage hikes in germany 's public sector would drive up the inflation rate , possibly forcing the bank to raise interest rates .
earlier this week german services union verdi - the biggest in the country - and public sector employers struck a deal on wage rises of around eight percent over two years for 1.3 million staff .
" enormous mistake to imitate germany " " the wage agreements are sharply higher than we expected , " bundesbank president axel weber told journalists . " we are going to have a close look at the -lsb- inflation -rsb- forecasts to see if public sector wage deals do n't make a revision necessary . "
weber added that those accords often set the tone for other pay negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's coup of an eight-percent pay hike has some finance experts alarmed " we are concerned about that , " he said , insisting that the german public sector was in a unique situation because it had gone without pay increases for several years .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet said the german public sector could not afford to serve as a model for other countries .
he stressed that wage development had to be in tandem with competitiveness and productivity of a country .
" a sensible wage policy is decisive for further growth in employment , " trichet said .
" it would be an enormous mistake to imitate germany . "
in the face of such inflation , euro-zone officials say that wage demands should not exceed productivity growth .
inflation at " incredible level " german finance minister peer steinbrueck however defended the strong pay rises in the public sector , saying the agreements followed job cuts and two years without net wage increases .
" employees have behaved very responsibly , they must have a share in the good economic development , " steinbrueck said .
jean-claude juncker , head of the euro zone countries finance ministers ' meetings , admitted that trade unions were right take into account inflation in their demands for higher wages , adding the weakest in society were hit the worst by price rises .
" those living on 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , 700 euros ca n't live with runaway inflation , " juncker said , adding that inflation was at an " incredible level . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 05.04.2008 berlin art upgrades from sexy to sophisticated großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin biennial has established itself on the city 's packed arts calendar the berlin biennial is designed to consolidate the city 's status as a fertile breeding ground for avant garde art .
but cultivating creativity is one thing - getting buyers to spend is another matter . berlin played a key role in european art throughout the 20th century , spawning generations of avant-garde artists and inspiring many of the revolutionary movements that shaped the art world in the last 100 years .
but although the city was traditionally a magnet for artists in the first half of the 20th century , its 40-year division left it out in the cold until reunification in 1990 , existing wholly outside of the commercial world and completely cut off from international contacts and influences .
in subsequent years , low rents and the heady atmosphere of change made it once again attractive to creative types who helped put it - slowly but surely - back on the art map .
so when it comes to numbers of artists and galleries , the city 's art industry has long been competing with london and new york .
but while there are some 450 galleries in the city - authorities estimate that one new gallery opens each week - there 's relatively little international money being spent here .
mayor klaus wowereit made a virtue of neccessity when he dubbed the city " poor but sexy , " but the reality is that the city would be thrilled if its much-touted arts and culture could also bring home the bacon .
the last decade has seen a clutch of major art fairs do their bit to entice out-of-town investors , including the annual art forum , founded in 1995 , the berlin biennial in 2003 and the annual gallery weekend launched in 2005 .
biennial bonanza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new nationalgalerie is one of the biennial 's venues the 5th berlin biennial for contemporary art , entitled " when things cast no shadow " and curated by adam szymczyk and elena filipovic , started luring the art world 's glitterati to the capital as of friday , april 5 .
the event will comprise two parts , day and night .
during the day , artworks and specially commissioned projects will be on view at three main venues , selected for their cultural significance as well as for their political and economic contexts .
they range from established galleries to al fresco makeshift museums . each venue offers a very different type of exhibition space , with distinctive conditions and frameworks for the artists , artworks , and viewers .
during the night , the exhibition will continue in the form of diverse events held in widely different sites throughout the city every evening .
the lure of the hauptstadt using the city as a complement to the art being showcased is characteristic of the contemporary scene .
" berlin has an urban charm that is n't only about art , " said klaus gerrit friese , president of the german association of german galleries .
" a city that plays host to key events , be they political , social or artistic , will always attract plenty of international artists . "
thomas schulte , another berlin gallery owner , noted in the international herald tribune last month that the german capital has a history of attracting foreign artists that dates back to the 1920s .
" its geographical position stimulates various cultural exchanges between the east and the west , " he said , pointing out that the tradition was brutally interrupted by the rise of nazism , world war ii and the partition of germany .
paying off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work by german artist thomas demand is snapped up by collectors but according to martin mertens , a gallery owner and art historian , berlin 's main appeal is precisely that it has trodden a new unique path that set its apart from the glitzier and more commercial art being peddled on london 's cork street or in new york 's soho .
" most of the international artists have moved to berlin because apartments and studios are still relatively cheap , " he said .
he pays 400 euros -lrb- $ 625 -rrb- a month for his gallery space on the brunnenstrasse , a street on the outskirts of the gentrified mitte neighborhood , currently billed as the hippest art avenue in town - and said he could never dream of such a low rent in london or paris .
friese is confident that the buzz will soon start to pay off .
" we 're hoping to see the emergence of a collectorship on the same scale as in cologne -lsb- the commercial center of the german art scene -rsb- , " he said .
" let 's wait five years , then we 'll see a change in the figures . "
he predicted that it wo n't be long before the cash starts to flow , and said a number of well-heeled collectors are moving to berlin - including christian boros , the hoffmanns , axel haubrock and wilhelm schuermann .

" the bnd neither provided training assistance nor was it connected as a consultant or adviser , " a spokesperson told the german dpa news agency on saturday . despite the denial , several parliamentarians on saturday called for the parliamentary control committee , which concerns itself with the activities of the secret services , to look into the matter .

" german defence minister franz josef jung also condemned the officers ' behaviour , saying : " this should under no circumstances be accepted . " a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry in berlin said it was looking into the claims . disciplinary proceedings have started against eight police officers from the state of north rhine-westphalia and one member of the german army .

the germans told their superiors they were on vacation in tunisia , according to a report in saturday 's sueddeutsche zeitung . the berliner zeitung said former chancellor gerhard schroeder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi agreed in october 2004 that germany would provide training to gaddafi 's security apparatus . the report added that the bnd insisted on keeping its role in the program behind the scenes .
the organization came under heavy criticism in 1995 when the bnd 's involvement in training libyan police and military forces in the late-1970s came to light . germans trained around 120 policemen at a barracks in tripoli , spiegel said , adding that the libyans were taught police driving methods and how to storm buildings and board ships . the instructors held several meetings with german embassy officials to brief them on the program , the magazine added . accusations of germans providing instruction to libyans should be addressed by the german parliament 's intelligence oversight committee , said max stadler of the opposition 's free-market liberal fdp and committee member .

" energy talks steinmeier is scheduled to meet with polish prime minister donald tusk and his polish counterpart radek sikorski .
talks are expected to focus on energy security and climate protection . poland remains opposed to plans to connect germany to russian gas supplies via a pipeline along the bottom of the baltic sea .
currently a transit country for much of the gas russia exports to western europe , poland fears russia could cut its energy supplies . but that 's a concern steinmeier said could be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned pipeline between russia and germany would bypass poland " in the spirit of european solidarity , germany and poland could create the technological infrastructure on their border so that gas and electricity could flow from germany to poland in the case of a delivery stop , " steinmeier said . poland relies heavily on coal-fired power stations and germany too is to build further coal power plants , steinmeier wrote , adding that the development of cleaner coal technologies was of huge interest to both nations . steinmeier wrote that the countries could combine their efforts to develop environmentally friendly technology to burn coal efficiently and recapture greenhouse gas emissions . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 05.04.2008 berlin art upgrades from sexy to sophisticated großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin biennial has established itself on the city 's packed arts calendar the berlin biennial is designed to consolidate the city 's status as a fertile breeding ground for avant garde art .
but cultivating creativity is one thing - getting buyers to spend is another matter . berlin played a key role in european art throughout the 20th century , spawning generations of avant-garde artists and inspiring many of the revolutionary movements that shaped the art world in the last 100 years .
but although the city was traditionally a magnet for artists in the first half of the 20th century , its 40-year division left it out in the cold until reunification in 1990 , existing wholly outside of the commercial world and completely cut off from international contacts and influences .
in subsequent years , low rents and the heady atmosphere of change made it once again attractive to creative types who helped put it - slowly but surely - back on the art map .
so when it comes to numbers of artists and galleries , the city 's art industry has long been competing with london and new york .

but cultivating creativity is one thing - getting buyers to spend is another matter . berlin played a key role in european art throughout the 20th century , spawning generations of avant-garde artists and inspiring many of the revolutionary movements that shaped the art world in the last 100 years .
but although the city was traditionally a magnet for artists in the first half of the 20th century , its 40-year division left it out in the cold until reunification in 1990 , existing wholly outside of the commercial world and completely cut off from international contacts and influences .
in subsequent years , low rents and the heady atmosphere of change made it once again attractive to creative types who helped put it - slowly but surely - back on the art map .
so when it comes to numbers of artists and galleries , the city 's art industry has long been competing with london and new york .
but while there are some 450 galleries in the city - authorities estimate that one new gallery opens each week - there 's relatively little international money being spent here .
mayor klaus wowereit made a virtue of neccessity when he dubbed the city " poor but sexy , " but the reality is that the city would be thrilled if its much-touted arts and culture could also bring home the bacon .
the last decade has seen a clutch of major art fairs do their bit to entice out-of-town investors , including the annual art forum , founded in 1995 , the berlin biennial in 2003 and the annual gallery weekend launched in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 05.04.2008 germany celebrates 100 years of international soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-match beers and reticent fans marked germany 's international debut in 1908 one hundred years have passed since the german national soccer team took to the field in basel to play switzerland in its first competitive international game - but it might as well be a million . around 3,500 spectators turned out to see germany 's fledgling eagles take on switzerland on april 5 , 1908 , a fraction of those who now regularly support the national team on away matches .
the atmosphere was also light years away from today 's regularly raucous celebrations .
spectators at the landhof ground were told to refrain from making loud calls and female fans were treated to complimentary chocolates . the swiss , who had played their first game as a national team three years earlier , ran out 5-3 winners after 19-year-old fritz becker had opened the scoring for germany to become his nation 's first ever international goal scorer . fast forward to march 26 , 2008 and 38,500 rowdy spectators watched germany 's return to basel in their 800th game , where current coach joachim loew 's visitors trounced the home side 4-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 years on , germany exacted revenge in basel instead of sharing a few beers with the opposition before the game as was the case in 1908 , the germans spent the pre-match preparations in the company of their team of doctors , sports psychologists , physiotherapists , media specialists and even own their own cooks . pre-match boozing , free sweets for the ladies and reticent fans have long been consigned to the history books , along with germany 's early habit of losing too many consecutive matches . after the first game and defeat , germany waited over a year for their first victory , a 1-0 revenge win over the swiss in karlsruhe .
since then , while there have been losses - and thrashings , the largest being a 9-0 reverse against england two weeks before the national team 's first win - germany has built a reputation for well-disciplined success , even when not playing particularly well . germans cut from a different cloth " all germans come from the same factory , presumably the ironworks , " argentina 's world cup-winning coach cesar luis menotti once noted , commenting on the resilience of a long list of legendary players who never gave up and who are responsible in part for building a soccer legacy over the past 100 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz walter , one of the 1954 world cup winners players such as franz beckenbauer , uwe seeler , fritz walter , top scorer gerd mueller and lothar matthaeus , germany 's most-capped star , have come to epitomize the teutonic spirit that was forged in those early forays on the international scene and which eventually brought the national team world cup titles in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 as well as european championship triumphs in 1972 , 1980 and 1996 . as well as success in international tournaments , germany has been involved in some of the most memorable landmark matches in soccer history : a 3-2 triumph over hungary in the 1954 world cup final , the 1966 final they lost 4-2 against england , the heroic battle with italy they lost 4-3 in the 1970 semi-finals . germany also won the first penalty shoot-out at a world cup , against france in the 1982 semis .
fourteen years later germany also won the first major championship final decided by a golden goal , at euro 1996 over the czech republic . dfb celebrates a successful run germany have won 457 of the 800 matches played so far , with 164 draws and 179 defeats .
german teams scored 1,782 goals and conceded 965 .
in addition , an east german national team played 293 matches between 1952 and 1990 - famously beating west germany 1-0 at the 1974 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer 's 1990 world cup-winning team " we 've had quite a successful run , " german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger told the federation 's web site .
" just think about which accomplishments were triggered by soccer in germany , especially following world war ii .
soccer always moved the people living here , whether because of the many major triumphs or defeats .
we have really had an incredible journey . " consistency has always been a part of germany 's century of success .
the national team has only had 10 coaches in its 100 years of international competition , the legendary sepp herberger being the longest-serving .
the coach of the " heroes of bern " - germany 's first world cup winners in 1954 - held the post for 28 years .
his successors held tenures of ever-shortening length ; the last manager to leave office , juergen klinsmann , lasting just two years in another sign of how times have changed . team and federation grows together it has n't been just the national team which has developed into a success over the last 100 years .
the dfb was founded eight years before the national team was created but has enjoyed remarkable success in tandem with it over the past century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer in germany has exploded in the last century " obviously the dfb has grown in the last 100 years , " said thomas hackbarth , director of communications at the dfb .
" it is now one of the biggest sporting associations in europe , employing over 200 people across 21 regional offices and boasting 6.5 million members .
these are people who are or who have been actively involved with german soccer , both in a professional and amateur capacity . " another huge development in the last 100 years is the growth of women 's soccer and the dfb now has over 1 million female members , " hackbarth added .
" this is one of the reasons the 2011 women 's world cup was awarded to germany because the growth in the women 's game here has been phenomenal . " a century of organizational progress aside from the on-field success , germany and the dfb have become synonymous with preparatory perfection in the world of soccer .
as the game has developed over the last 100 years , both the team and the organization behind it have adapted to a changing landscape , culminating in the hugely successful hosting of the 2006 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " fan mile " was a landmark in world cup evolution " the 2006 world cup was a great success , not just with the national team 's performance , but the whole event , " hackbarth said .
" the dfb proved that it could handle the organization of such a massive event and create an atmosphere of inclusion , humor and safety . " the 2006 world cup was unrecognizable from the first world cup germany participated in 1934 , " he added .
" maybe in the next 100 years , the same thing will be said about 2006 . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the atmosphere was also light years away from today 's regularly raucous celebrations .
spectators at the landhof ground were told to refrain from making loud calls and female fans were treated to complimentary chocolates . the swiss , who had played their first game as a national team three years earlier , ran out 5-3 winners after 19-year-old fritz becker had opened the scoring for germany to become his nation 's first ever international goal scorer . fast forward to march 26 , 2008 and 38,500 rowdy spectators watched germany 's return to basel in their 800th game , where current coach joachim loew 's visitors trounced the home side 4-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 years on , germany exacted revenge in basel instead of sharing a few beers with the opposition before the game as was the case in 1908 , the germans spent the pre-match preparations in the company of their team of doctors , sports psychologists , physiotherapists , media specialists and even own their own cooks . pre-match boozing , free sweets for the ladies and reticent fans have long been consigned to the history books , along with germany 's early habit of losing too many consecutive matches . after the first game and defeat , germany waited over a year for their first victory , a 1-0 revenge win over the swiss in karlsruhe .
since then , while there have been losses - and thrashings , the largest being a 9-0 reverse against england two weeks before the national team 's first win - germany has built a reputation for well-disciplined success , even when not playing particularly well . germans cut from a different cloth " all germans come from the same factory , presumably the ironworks , " argentina 's world cup-winning coach cesar luis menotti once noted , commenting on the resilience of a long list of legendary players who never gave up and who are responsible in part for building a soccer legacy over the past 100 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz walter , one of the 1954 world cup winners players such as franz beckenbauer , uwe seeler , fritz walter , top scorer gerd mueller and lothar matthaeus , germany 's most-capped star , have come to epitomize the teutonic spirit that was forged in those early forays on the international scene and which eventually brought the national team world cup titles in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 as well as european championship triumphs in 1972 , 1980 and 1996 . as well as success in international tournaments , germany has been involved in some of the most memorable landmark matches in soccer history : a 3-2 triumph over hungary in the 1954 world cup final , the 1966 final they lost 4-2 against england , the heroic battle with italy they lost 4-3 in the 1970 semi-finals . germany also won the first penalty shoot-out at a world cup , against france in the 1982 semis .

we have really had an incredible journey . " consistency has always been a part of germany 's century of success .
the national team has only had 10 coaches in its 100 years of international competition , the legendary sepp herberger being the longest-serving .
the coach of the " heroes of bern " - germany 's first world cup winners in 1954 - held the post for 28 years .
his successors held tenures of ever-shortening length ; the last manager to leave office , juergen klinsmann , lasting just two years in another sign of how times have changed . team and federation grows together it has n't been just the national team which has developed into a success over the last 100 years .

" it is now one of the biggest sporting associations in europe , employing over 200 people across 21 regional offices and boasting 6.5 million members .
these are people who are or who have been actively involved with german soccer , both in a professional and amateur capacity . " another huge development in the last 100 years is the growth of women 's soccer and the dfb now has over 1 million female members , " hackbarth added .

the atmosphere was also light years away from today 's regularly raucous celebrations .
spectators at the landhof ground were told to refrain from making loud calls and female fans were treated to complimentary chocolates . the swiss , who had played their first game as a national team three years earlier , ran out 5-3 winners after 19-year-old fritz becker had opened the scoring for germany to become his nation 's first ever international goal scorer . fast forward to march 26 , 2008 and 38,500 rowdy spectators watched germany 's return to basel in their 800th game , where current coach joachim loew 's visitors trounced the home side 4-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 years on , germany exacted revenge in basel instead of sharing a few beers with the opposition before the game as was the case in 1908 , the germans spent the pre-match preparations in the company of their team of doctors , sports psychologists , physiotherapists , media specialists and even own their own cooks . pre-match boozing , free sweets for the ladies and reticent fans have long been consigned to the history books , along with germany 's early habit of losing too many consecutive matches . after the first game and defeat , germany waited over a year for their first victory , a 1-0 revenge win over the swiss in karlsruhe .
since then , while there have been losses - and thrashings , the largest being a 9-0 reverse against england two weeks before the national team 's first win - germany has built a reputation for well-disciplined success , even when not playing particularly well . germans cut from a different cloth " all germans come from the same factory , presumably the ironworks , " argentina 's world cup-winning coach cesar luis menotti once noted , commenting on the resilience of a long list of legendary players who never gave up and who are responsible in part for building a soccer legacy over the past 100 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz walter , one of the 1954 world cup winners players such as franz beckenbauer , uwe seeler , fritz walter , top scorer gerd mueller and lothar matthaeus , germany 's most-capped star , have come to epitomize the teutonic spirit that was forged in those early forays on the international scene and which eventually brought the national team world cup titles in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 as well as european championship triumphs in 1972 , 1980 and 1996 . as well as success in international tournaments , germany has been involved in some of the most memorable landmark matches in soccer history : a 3-2 triumph over hungary in the 1954 world cup final , the 1966 final they lost 4-2 against england , the heroic battle with italy they lost 4-3 in the 1970 semi-finals . germany also won the first penalty shoot-out at a world cup , against france in the 1982 semis .
fourteen years later germany also won the first major championship final decided by a golden goal , at euro 1996 over the czech republic . dfb celebrates a successful run germany have won 457 of the 800 matches played so far , with 164 draws and 179 defeats .
german teams scored 1,782 goals and conceded 965 .
in addition , an east german national team played 293 matches between 1952 and 1990 - famously beating west germany 1-0 at the 1974 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer 's 1990 world cup-winning team " we 've had quite a successful run , " german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger told the federation 's web site .
" just think about which accomplishments were triggered by soccer in germany , especially following world war ii .
soccer always moved the people living here , whether because of the many major triumphs or defeats .
we have really had an incredible journey . " consistency has always been a part of germany 's century of success .
the national team has only had 10 coaches in its 100 years of international competition , the legendary sepp herberger being the longest-serving .
the coach of the " heroes of bern " - germany 's first world cup winners in 1954 - held the post for 28 years .
his successors held tenures of ever-shortening length ; the last manager to leave office , juergen klinsmann , lasting just two years in another sign of how times have changed . team and federation grows together it has n't been just the national team which has developed into a success over the last 100 years .
the dfb was founded eight years before the national team was created but has enjoyed remarkable success in tandem with it over the past century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer in germany has exploded in the last century " obviously the dfb has grown in the last 100 years , " said thomas hackbarth , director of communications at the dfb .
" it is now one of the biggest sporting associations in europe , employing over 200 people across 21 regional offices and boasting 6.5 million members .
these are people who are or who have been actively involved with german soccer , both in a professional and amateur capacity . " another huge development in the last 100 years is the growth of women 's soccer and the dfb now has over 1 million female members , " hackbarth added .
" this is one of the reasons the 2011 women 's world cup was awarded to germany because the growth in the women 's game here has been phenomenal . " a century of organizational progress aside from the on-field success , germany and the dfb have become synonymous with preparatory perfection in the world of soccer .
as the game has developed over the last 100 years , both the team and the organization behind it have adapted to a changing landscape , culminating in the hugely successful hosting of the 2006 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " fan mile " was a landmark in world cup evolution " the 2006 world cup was a great success , not just with the national team 's performance , but the whole event , " hackbarth said .

the atmosphere was also light years away from today 's regularly raucous celebrations .
spectators at the landhof ground were told to refrain from making loud calls and female fans were treated to complimentary chocolates . the swiss , who had played their first game as a national team three years earlier , ran out 5-3 winners after 19-year-old fritz becker had opened the scoring for germany to become his nation 's first ever international goal scorer . fast forward to march 26 , 2008 and 38,500 rowdy spectators watched germany 's return to basel in their 800th game , where current coach joachim loew 's visitors trounced the home side 4-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 years on , germany exacted revenge in basel instead of sharing a few beers with the opposition before the game as was the case in 1908 , the germans spent the pre-match preparations in the company of their team of doctors , sports psychologists , physiotherapists , media specialists and even own their own cooks . pre-match boozing , free sweets for the ladies and reticent fans have long been consigned to the history books , along with germany 's early habit of losing too many consecutive matches . after the first game and defeat , germany waited over a year for their first victory , a 1-0 revenge win over the swiss in karlsruhe .
since then , while there have been losses - and thrashings , the largest being a 9-0 reverse against england two weeks before the national team 's first win - germany has built a reputation for well-disciplined success , even when not playing particularly well . germans cut from a different cloth " all germans come from the same factory , presumably the ironworks , " argentina 's world cup-winning coach cesar luis menotti once noted , commenting on the resilience of a long list of legendary players who never gave up and who are responsible in part for building a soccer legacy over the past 100 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz walter , one of the 1954 world cup winners players such as franz beckenbauer , uwe seeler , fritz walter , top scorer gerd mueller and lothar matthaeus , germany 's most-capped star , have come to epitomize the teutonic spirit that was forged in those early forays on the international scene and which eventually brought the national team world cup titles in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 as well as european championship triumphs in 1972 , 1980 and 1996 . as well as success in international tournaments , germany has been involved in some of the most memorable landmark matches in soccer history : a 3-2 triumph over hungary in the 1954 world cup final , the 1966 final they lost 4-2 against england , the heroic battle with italy they lost 4-3 in the 1970 semi-finals . germany also won the first penalty shoot-out at a world cup , against france in the 1982 semis .
fourteen years later germany also won the first major championship final decided by a golden goal , at euro 1996 over the czech republic . dfb celebrates a successful run germany have won 457 of the 800 matches played so far , with 164 draws and 179 defeats .
german teams scored 1,782 goals and conceded 965 .
in addition , an east german national team played 293 matches between 1952 and 1990 - famously beating west germany 1-0 at the 1974 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer 's 1990 world cup-winning team " we 've had quite a successful run , " german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger told the federation 's web site .
" just think about which accomplishments were triggered by soccer in germany , especially following world war ii .
soccer always moved the people living here , whether because of the many major triumphs or defeats .
we have really had an incredible journey . " consistency has always been a part of germany 's century of success .
the national team has only had 10 coaches in its 100 years of international competition , the legendary sepp herberger being the longest-serving .
the coach of the " heroes of bern " - germany 's first world cup winners in 1954 - held the post for 28 years .
his successors held tenures of ever-shortening length ; the last manager to leave office , juergen klinsmann , lasting just two years in another sign of how times have changed . team and federation grows together it has n't been just the national team which has developed into a success over the last 100 years .
the dfb was founded eight years before the national team was created but has enjoyed remarkable success in tandem with it over the past century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer in germany has exploded in the last century " obviously the dfb has grown in the last 100 years , " said thomas hackbarth , director of communications at the dfb .
" it is now one of the biggest sporting associations in europe , employing over 200 people across 21 regional offices and boasting 6.5 million members .
these are people who are or who have been actively involved with german soccer , both in a professional and amateur capacity . " another huge development in the last 100 years is the growth of women 's soccer and the dfb now has over 1 million female members , " hackbarth added .

" a century of organizational progress aside from the on-field success , germany and the dfb have become synonymous with preparatory perfection in the world of soccer .

but cultivating creativity is one thing - getting buyers to spend is another matter . berlin played a key role in european art throughout the 20th century , spawning generations of avant-garde artists and inspiring many of the revolutionary movements that shaped the art world in the last 100 years .
but although the city was traditionally a magnet for artists in the first half of the 20th century , its 40-year division left it out in the cold until reunification in 1990 , existing wholly outside of the commercial world and completely cut off from international contacts and influences .
in subsequent years , low rents and the heady atmosphere of change made it once again attractive to creative types who helped put it - slowly but surely - back on the art map .
so when it comes to numbers of artists and galleries , the city 's art industry has long been competing with london and new york .
but while there are some 450 galleries in the city - authorities estimate that one new gallery opens each week - there 's relatively little international money being spent here .
mayor klaus wowereit made a virtue of neccessity when he dubbed the city " poor but sexy , " but the reality is that the city would be thrilled if its much-touted arts and culture could also bring home the bacon .

the event will comprise two parts , day and night .
during the day , artworks and specially commissioned projects will be on view at three main venues , selected for their cultural significance as well as for their political and economic contexts .
they range from established galleries to al fresco makeshift museums . each venue offers a very different type of exhibition space , with distinctive conditions and frameworks for the artists , artworks , and viewers .
during the night , the exhibition will continue in the form of diverse events held in widely different sites throughout the city every evening .

" berlin has an urban charm that is n't only about art , " said klaus gerrit friese , president of the german association of german galleries .
" a city that plays host to key events , be they political , social or artistic , will always attract plenty of international artists . "
thomas schulte , another berlin gallery owner , noted in the international herald tribune last month that the german capital has a history of attracting foreign artists that dates back to the 1920s .

" most of the international artists have moved to berlin because apartments and studios are still relatively cheap , " he said .
he pays 400 euros -lrb- $ 625 -rrb- a month for his gallery space on the brunnenstrasse , a street on the outskirts of the gentrified mitte neighborhood , currently billed as the hippest art avenue in town - and said he could never dream of such a low rent in london or paris .
friese is confident that the buzz will soon start to pay off .
" we 're hoping to see the emergence of a collectorship on the same scale as in cologne -lsb- the commercial center of the german art scene -rsb- , " he said .
" let 's wait five years , then we 'll see a change in the figures . "

neither party was able to form an alliance with their preferred partners , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens and left party for the spd .
at saturday 's opening session of the new parliament , none of the five parties presented a candidate to challenge koch , allowing him to continue as acting premier .
koch ran a divisive election campaign highlighting crimes committed by foreign youth .
he seized on a violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
his comments sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime he is now expected to try and persuade the greens to join him in a coalition at a later stage .

the greens won 9 seats in the elections , the fdp 11 and the left 6 .

" in a letter to fia president max mosley , the adac has distanced itself from events surrounding his person , " adac said . the 67-year-old son of former british fascist party leader oswald mosley , max mosley faces mounting pressure to resign ever since a british newspaper published raunchy details of his personal life . the british sunday newspaper news of the world alleged that mosley was involved in a nazi-style sex orgy with prostitutes in london last friday .
the newspaper posted a video on its web site , showing mosley having sex with five prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adac says mosley 's position has become untenable the adac said the role of an fia president who represents more than 100 million motorists worldwide should not be burdened by such an affair .
therefore , we ask the president to " very carefully reconsider his role within the organization , " the organization said . " it is in the interests of this world organization to carry on with its duties without the burden of this affair . " mosley denies nazi connotation mosley has not denied the incident took place , but insists there were no nazi overtones and he has done no wrong . mosley said he had written to adac , repeating an earlier statement that he would be suing the newspaper that published the story and posted the video on its website . the letter , parts of which were published on autosport.com , has been sent to all members of fia , as well as members of the world council for automobile mobility and tourism . he said that he would have resigned immediately had he been caught speeding or driving over the alcohol limit . " as it is , a scandal paper obtained by illegal means pictures of something i did in private which , although unacceptable to some people , was harmless and completely legal , " mosley said .
" it goes without saying that the so-called nazi element is pure fabrication .
this will become crystal clear when the matter comes to trial .
the newspaper invented this in order to spice up their story and introduce my family background , " he wrote in the letter to adac . " in short , i think i have done nothing wrong and that the wrong was done by the newspaper : " motorsport leading lights urge mosley to quit however , mosley faces a growing chorus of calls from the motorsport world and leading carmakers to step down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the motorsport world want mosley to go bmw , mercedes-benz , honda and toyota have all issued statements distancing themselves from the affair and calling for mosley to act. former racing drivers such as three-time world champion jackie steward and south african world champion jody scheckter have called for mosley to resign . they were joined on friday by the world 's largest auto club , the american automobile association -lrb- aaa -rrb- . " aaa recognizes that mr mosley has dedicated many years of his life to advancing the interests of mobility and motorsport .
however , after careful consideration , aaa has conveyed to mr mosley that it would be in the best interest of all concerned if he were to step down , " aaa public relations managing director yolanda clark was quoted as saying by news reports . clark named the damage done by the revelations about mosley " clearly public .

" it is in the interests of this world organization to carry on with its duties without the burden of this affair . " mosley denies nazi connotation mosley has not denied the incident took place , but insists there were no nazi overtones and he has done no wrong . mosley said he had written to adac , repeating an earlier statement that he would be suing the newspaper that published the story and posted the video on its website . the letter , parts of which were published on autosport.com , has been sent to all members of fia , as well as members of the world council for automobile mobility and tourism . he said that he would have resigned immediately had he been caught speeding or driving over the alcohol limit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 05.04.2008 berlin art upgrades from sexy to sophisticated großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin biennial has established itself on the city 's packed arts calendar the berlin biennial is designed to consolidate the city 's status as a fertile breeding ground for avant garde art .
but cultivating creativity is one thing - getting buyers to spend is another matter . berlin played a key role in european art throughout the 20th century , spawning generations of avant-garde artists and inspiring many of the revolutionary movements that shaped the art world in the last 100 years .
but although the city was traditionally a magnet for artists in the first half of the 20th century , its 40-year division left it out in the cold until reunification in 1990 , existing wholly outside of the commercial world and completely cut off from international contacts and influences .
in subsequent years , low rents and the heady atmosphere of change made it once again attractive to creative types who helped put it - slowly but surely - back on the art map .
so when it comes to numbers of artists and galleries , the city 's art industry has long been competing with london and new york .
but while there are some 450 galleries in the city - authorities estimate that one new gallery opens each week - there 's relatively little international money being spent here .
mayor klaus wowereit made a virtue of neccessity when he dubbed the city " poor but sexy , " but the reality is that the city would be thrilled if its much-touted arts and culture could also bring home the bacon .
the last decade has seen a clutch of major art fairs do their bit to entice out-of-town investors , including the annual art forum , founded in 1995 , the berlin biennial in 2003 and the annual gallery weekend launched in 2005 .
biennial bonanza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new nationalgalerie is one of the biennial 's venues the 5th berlin biennial for contemporary art , entitled " when things cast no shadow " and curated by adam szymczyk and elena filipovic , started luring the art world 's glitterati to the capital as of friday , april 5 .
the event will comprise two parts , day and night .
during the day , artworks and specially commissioned projects will be on view at three main venues , selected for their cultural significance as well as for their political and economic contexts .
they range from established galleries to al fresco makeshift museums . each venue offers a very different type of exhibition space , with distinctive conditions and frameworks for the artists , artworks , and viewers .
during the night , the exhibition will continue in the form of diverse events held in widely different sites throughout the city every evening .
the lure of the hauptstadt using the city as a complement to the art being showcased is characteristic of the contemporary scene .
" berlin has an urban charm that is n't only about art , " said klaus gerrit friese , president of the german association of german galleries .
" a city that plays host to key events , be they political , social or artistic , will always attract plenty of international artists . "
thomas schulte , another berlin gallery owner , noted in the international herald tribune last month that the german capital has a history of attracting foreign artists that dates back to the 1920s .
" its geographical position stimulates various cultural exchanges between the east and the west , " he said , pointing out that the tradition was brutally interrupted by the rise of nazism , world war ii and the partition of germany .
paying off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work by german artist thomas demand is snapped up by collectors but according to martin mertens , a gallery owner and art historian , berlin 's main appeal is precisely that it has trodden a new unique path that set its apart from the glitzier and more commercial art being peddled on london 's cork street or in new york 's soho .
" most of the international artists have moved to berlin because apartments and studios are still relatively cheap , " he said .
he pays 400 euros -lrb- $ 625 -rrb- a month for his gallery space on the brunnenstrasse , a street on the outskirts of the gentrified mitte neighborhood , currently billed as the hippest art avenue in town - and said he could never dream of such a low rent in london or paris .
friese is confident that the buzz will soon start to pay off .
" we 're hoping to see the emergence of a collectorship on the same scale as in cologne -lsb- the commercial center of the german art scene -rsb- , " he said .
" let 's wait five years , then we 'll see a change in the figures . "
he predicted that it wo n't be long before the cash starts to flow , and said a number of well-heeled collectors are moving to berlin - including christian boros , the hoffmanns , axel haubrock and wilhelm schuermann .
it 's good news for the contemporary art scene - but bound to leave the nay-sayers maintaining that berlin has lost its edge . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in a letter to fia president max mosley , the adac has distanced itself from events surrounding his person , " adac said . the 67-year-old son of former british fascist party leader oswald mosley , max mosley faces mounting pressure to resign ever since a british newspaper published raunchy details of his personal life . the british sunday newspaper news of the world alleged that mosley was involved in a nazi-style sex orgy with prostitutes in london last friday .
the newspaper posted a video on its web site , showing mosley having sex with five prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adac says mosley 's position has become untenable the adac said the role of an fia president who represents more than 100 million motorists worldwide should not be burdened by such an affair .
therefore , we ask the president to " very carefully reconsider his role within the organization , " the organization said . " it is in the interests of this world organization to carry on with its duties without the burden of this affair . " mosley denies nazi connotation mosley has not denied the incident took place , but insists there were no nazi overtones and he has done no wrong . mosley said he had written to adac , repeating an earlier statement that he would be suing the newspaper that published the story and posted the video on its website . the letter , parts of which were published on autosport.com , has been sent to all members of fia , as well as members of the world council for automobile mobility and tourism . he said that he would have resigned immediately had he been caught speeding or driving over the alcohol limit . " as it is , a scandal paper obtained by illegal means pictures of something i did in private which , although unacceptable to some people , was harmless and completely legal , " mosley said .
" it goes without saying that the so-called nazi element is pure fabrication .
this will become crystal clear when the matter comes to trial .

" in a letter to fia president max mosley , the adac has distanced itself from events surrounding his person , " adac said . the 67-year-old son of former british fascist party leader oswald mosley , max mosley faces mounting pressure to resign ever since a british newspaper published raunchy details of his personal life . the british sunday newspaper news of the world alleged that mosley was involved in a nazi-style sex orgy with prostitutes in london last friday .
the newspaper posted a video on its web site , showing mosley having sex with five prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adac says mosley 's position has become untenable the adac said the role of an fia president who represents more than 100 million motorists worldwide should not be burdened by such an affair .
therefore , we ask the president to " very carefully reconsider his role within the organization , " the organization said . " it is in the interests of this world organization to carry on with its duties without the burden of this affair . " mosley denies nazi connotation mosley has not denied the incident took place , but insists there were no nazi overtones and he has done no wrong . mosley said he had written to adac , repeating an earlier statement that he would be suing the newspaper that published the story and posted the video on its website . the letter , parts of which were published on autosport.com , has been sent to all members of fia , as well as members of the world council for automobile mobility and tourism . he said that he would have resigned immediately had he been caught speeding or driving over the alcohol limit . " as it is , a scandal paper obtained by illegal means pictures of something i did in private which , although unacceptable to some people , was harmless and completely legal , " mosley said .
" it goes without saying that the so-called nazi element is pure fabrication .
this will become crystal clear when the matter comes to trial .
the newspaper invented this in order to spice up their story and introduce my family background , " he wrote in the letter to adac . " in short , i think i have done nothing wrong and that the wrong was done by the newspaper : " motorsport leading lights urge mosley to quit however , mosley faces a growing chorus of calls from the motorsport world and leading carmakers to step down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the motorsport world want mosley to go bmw , mercedes-benz , honda and toyota have all issued statements distancing themselves from the affair and calling for mosley to act. former racing drivers such as three-time world champion jackie steward and south african world champion jody scheckter have called for mosley to resign . they were joined on friday by the world 's largest auto club , the american automobile association -lrb- aaa -rrb- . " aaa recognizes that mr mosley has dedicated many years of his life to advancing the interests of mobility and motorsport .
however , after careful consideration , aaa has conveyed to mr mosley that it would be in the best interest of all concerned if he were to step down , " aaa public relations managing director yolanda clark was quoted as saying by news reports . clark named the damage done by the revelations about mosley " clearly public . " she said that the fia and its leader " must uphold the highest standards of ethical behavior to exercise the moral authority required to represent millions of motorists .

the event organized by the european trade union confederation -lrb- egb -rrb- drew between 10,000 and 30,000 protesters .
" this is a protest against the situation in the whole of europe , " reinhard dombre , head of germany 's trade union federation told reuters .
egb general secretary john monks said eu finance ministers and bankers had to understand the concerns of employees .
" we can not accept the sermons and lectures of european central bankers and finance ministers , " monks said .
" europe 's workers want their fair share . "
euro-zone finance ministers and central bankers , meeting for two days in slovenian town of brdo , warned on saturday that demands for big wage hikes could fuel a dangerous wage-inflation spiral .
the bundesbank , or german central bank , cautioned that recent hefty wage hikes in germany 's public sector would drive up the inflation rate , possibly forcing the bank to raise interest rates .
earlier this week german services union verdi - the biggest in the country - and public sector employers struck a deal on wage rises of around eight percent over two years for 1.3 million staff .
" enormous mistake to imitate germany " " the wage agreements are sharply higher than we expected , " bundesbank president axel weber told journalists . " we are going to have a close look at the -lsb- inflation -rsb- forecasts to see if public sector wage deals do n't make a revision necessary . "
weber added that those accords often set the tone for other pay negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's coup of an eight-percent pay hike has some finance experts alarmed " we are concerned about that , " he said , insisting that the german public sector was in a unique situation because it had gone without pay increases for several years .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet said the german public sector could not afford to serve as a model for other countries .
he stressed that wage development had to be in tandem with competitiveness and productivity of a country .
" a sensible wage policy is decisive for further growth in employment , " trichet said .
" it would be an enormous mistake to imitate germany . "
in the face of such inflation , euro-zone officials say that wage demands should not exceed productivity growth .
inflation at " incredible level " german finance minister peer steinbrueck however defended the strong pay rises in the public sector , saying the agreements followed job cuts and two years without net wage increases .
" employees have behaved very responsibly , they must have a share in the good economic development , " steinbrueck said .
jean-claude juncker , head of the euro zone countries finance ministers ' meetings , admitted that trade unions were right take into account inflation in their demands for higher wages , adding the weakest in society were hit the worst by price rises .
" those living on 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , 700 euros ca n't live with runaway inflation , " juncker said , adding that inflation was at an " incredible level . "
inflation in the 15 euro-zone countries jumped in march to 3.5 percent - the highest level since the bloc was formed in 1999 , according to official eu data earlier this week .
worst yet to come for beleaguered banks steinbrueck and weber , however , said the worst was yet to come for european banks reeling under the global financial crisis . banks can expect worse because " unlike last year they ca n't write down their losses against a very good first half year , " weber told news agency ap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche bank announced huge losses two of europe 's largest banks - swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank - recently announced massive first quarter losses .
steinbrueck warned that banks were still not honest enough about the effects of the global crisis .
" this is still not satisfactory , " steinbrueck said , adding that if banks intended to blame each other for financial woes they would end up in a tough situation .
germany can weather turmoil despite the banking turmoil , the german finance minister said he is sticking to his growth forecasts for the german economy in 2008 , even as the credit crisis dents global expansion .
" i think we can weather the financial turmoil to a wide extent , " steinbrueck said in an interview with bloomberg television .
" germany is going to face a growth rate of about 1.7 , 1.6 percent , " he said . the german economy is so far coping with the global slowdown caused by a us housing recession , a stronger euro and record oil prices .
investor , business and consumer confidence all unexpectedly increased last month and unemployment fell to the lowest in more than 15 years .

the event organized by the european trade union confederation -lrb- egb -rrb- drew between 10,000 and 30,000 protesters .
" this is a protest against the situation in the whole of europe , " reinhard dombre , head of germany 's trade union federation told reuters .
egb general secretary john monks said eu finance ministers and bankers had to understand the concerns of employees .
" we can not accept the sermons and lectures of european central bankers and finance ministers , " monks said .
" europe 's workers want their fair share . "
euro-zone finance ministers and central bankers , meeting for two days in slovenian town of brdo , warned on saturday that demands for big wage hikes could fuel a dangerous wage-inflation spiral .
the bundesbank , or german central bank , cautioned that recent hefty wage hikes in germany 's public sector would drive up the inflation rate , possibly forcing the bank to raise interest rates .
earlier this week german services union verdi - the biggest in the country - and public sector employers struck a deal on wage rises of around eight percent over two years for 1.3 million staff .
" enormous mistake to imitate germany " " the wage agreements are sharply higher than we expected , " bundesbank president axel weber told journalists . " we are going to have a close look at the -lsb- inflation -rsb- forecasts to see if public sector wage deals do n't make a revision necessary . "
weber added that those accords often set the tone for other pay negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's coup of an eight-percent pay hike has some finance experts alarmed " we are concerned about that , " he said , insisting that the german public sector was in a unique situation because it had gone without pay increases for several years .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet said the german public sector could not afford to serve as a model for other countries .
he stressed that wage development had to be in tandem with competitiveness and productivity of a country .
" a sensible wage policy is decisive for further growth in employment , " trichet said .
" it would be an enormous mistake to imitate germany . "
in the face of such inflation , euro-zone officials say that wage demands should not exceed productivity growth .
inflation at " incredible level " german finance minister peer steinbrueck however defended the strong pay rises in the public sector , saying the agreements followed job cuts and two years without net wage increases .
" employees have behaved very responsibly , they must have a share in the good economic development , " steinbrueck said .
jean-claude juncker , head of the euro zone countries finance ministers ' meetings , admitted that trade unions were right take into account inflation in their demands for higher wages , adding the weakest in society were hit the worst by price rises .
" those living on 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , 700 euros ca n't live with runaway inflation , " juncker said , adding that inflation was at an " incredible level . "
inflation in the 15 euro-zone countries jumped in march to 3.5 percent - the highest level since the bloc was formed in 1999 , according to official eu data earlier this week .
worst yet to come for beleaguered banks steinbrueck and weber , however , said the worst was yet to come for european banks reeling under the global financial crisis . banks can expect worse because " unlike last year they ca n't write down their losses against a very good first half year , " weber told news agency ap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche bank announced huge losses two of europe 's largest banks - swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank - recently announced massive first quarter losses .
steinbrueck warned that banks were still not honest enough about the effects of the global crisis .
" this is still not satisfactory , " steinbrueck said , adding that if banks intended to blame each other for financial woes they would end up in a tough situation .
germany can weather turmoil despite the banking turmoil , the german finance minister said he is sticking to his growth forecasts for the german economy in 2008 , even as the credit crisis dents global expansion .
" i think we can weather the financial turmoil to a wide extent , " steinbrueck said in an interview with bloomberg television .
" germany is going to face a growth rate of about 1.7 , 1.6 percent , " he said . the german economy is so far coping with the global slowdown caused by a us housing recession , a stronger euro and record oil prices .
investor , business and consumer confidence all unexpectedly increased last month and unemployment fell to the lowest in more than 15 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 05.04.2008 berlin art upgrades from sexy to sophisticated großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin biennial has established itself on the city 's packed arts calendar the berlin biennial is designed to consolidate the city 's status as a fertile breeding ground for avant garde art .
but cultivating creativity is one thing - getting buyers to spend is another matter . berlin played a key role in european art throughout the 20th century , spawning generations of avant-garde artists and inspiring many of the revolutionary movements that shaped the art world in the last 100 years .
but although the city was traditionally a magnet for artists in the first half of the 20th century , its 40-year division left it out in the cold until reunification in 1990 , existing wholly outside of the commercial world and completely cut off from international contacts and influences .
in subsequent years , low rents and the heady atmosphere of change made it once again attractive to creative types who helped put it - slowly but surely - back on the art map .
so when it comes to numbers of artists and galleries , the city 's art industry has long been competing with london and new york .
but while there are some 450 galleries in the city - authorities estimate that one new gallery opens each week - there 's relatively little international money being spent here .
mayor klaus wowereit made a virtue of neccessity when he dubbed the city " poor but sexy , " but the reality is that the city would be thrilled if its much-touted arts and culture could also bring home the bacon .
the last decade has seen a clutch of major art fairs do their bit to entice out-of-town investors , including the annual art forum , founded in 1995 , the berlin biennial in 2003 and the annual gallery weekend launched in 2005 .
biennial bonanza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new nationalgalerie is one of the biennial 's venues the 5th berlin biennial for contemporary art , entitled " when things cast no shadow " and curated by adam szymczyk and elena filipovic , started luring the art world 's glitterati to the capital as of friday , april 5 .
the event will comprise two parts , day and night .
during the day , artworks and specially commissioned projects will be on view at three main venues , selected for their cultural significance as well as for their political and economic contexts .
they range from established galleries to al fresco makeshift museums . each venue offers a very different type of exhibition space , with distinctive conditions and frameworks for the artists , artworks , and viewers .
during the night , the exhibition will continue in the form of diverse events held in widely different sites throughout the city every evening .
the lure of the hauptstadt using the city as a complement to the art being showcased is characteristic of the contemporary scene .
" berlin has an urban charm that is n't only about art , " said klaus gerrit friese , president of the german association of german galleries .
" a city that plays host to key events , be they political , social or artistic , will always attract plenty of international artists . "
thomas schulte , another berlin gallery owner , noted in the international herald tribune last month that the german capital has a history of attracting foreign artists that dates back to the 1920s .
" its geographical position stimulates various cultural exchanges between the east and the west , " he said , pointing out that the tradition was brutally interrupted by the rise of nazism , world war ii and the partition of germany .
paying off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work by german artist thomas demand is snapped up by collectors but according to martin mertens , a gallery owner and art historian , berlin 's main appeal is precisely that it has trodden a new unique path that set its apart from the glitzier and more commercial art being peddled on london 's cork street or in new york 's soho .
" most of the international artists have moved to berlin because apartments and studios are still relatively cheap , " he said .
he pays 400 euros -lrb- $ 625 -rrb- a month for his gallery space on the brunnenstrasse , a street on the outskirts of the gentrified mitte neighborhood , currently billed as the hippest art avenue in town - and said he could never dream of such a low rent in london or paris .
friese is confident that the buzz will soon start to pay off .
" we 're hoping to see the emergence of a collectorship on the same scale as in cologne -lsb- the commercial center of the german art scene -rsb- , " he said .
" let 's wait five years , then we 'll see a change in the figures . "
he predicted that it wo n't be long before the cash starts to flow , and said a number of well-heeled collectors are moving to berlin - including christian boros , the hoffmanns , axel haubrock and wilhelm schuermann .

" the bnd neither provided training assistance nor was it connected as a consultant or adviser , " a spokesperson told the german dpa news agency on saturday . despite the denial , several parliamentarians on saturday called for the parliamentary control committee , which concerns itself with the activities of the secret services , to look into the matter . " the mention of the name ' libya ' alone should have alarm bells ringing at the bnd , " wolfgang bosbach , leader of the parliamentary group of christian democrats and their sister party , the christian social , union , told bild am sonntag . green party leader claudia roth spoke of an " incredible need for explanation . " german defence minister franz josef jung also condemned the officers ' behaviour , saying : " this should under no circumstances be accepted . " a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry in berlin said it was looking into the claims . disciplinary proceedings have started against eight police officers from the state of north rhine-westphalia and one member of the german army .
as many as 30 germans are reported to have been paid by libya for their roles in training foreign security authorities . well-paid vacations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one paper said schroeder and gaddafi organized the training agreement once shunned by the international community for supporting terrorists , libya has taken a more pro-western course in recent years .
however , it still comes under fire from rights groups over its human rights record . the germans accused of illegally training libyans received as much as 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,610 -rrb- for preparing or conducting the seminars held in their spare time .
the germans told their superiors they were on vacation in tunisia , according to a report in saturday 's sueddeutsche zeitung . the berliner zeitung said former chancellor gerhard schroeder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi agreed in october 2004 that germany would provide training to gaddafi 's security apparatus . the report added that the bnd insisted on keeping its role in the program behind the scenes .
the organization came under heavy criticism in 1995 when the bnd 's involvement in training libyan police and military forces in the late-1970s came to light . germans trained around 120 policemen at a barracks in tripoli , spiegel said , adding that the libyans were taught police driving methods and how to storm buildings and board ships . the instructors held several meetings with german embassy officials to brief them on the program , the magazine added . accusations of germans providing instruction to libyans should be addressed by the german parliament 's intelligence oversight committee , said max stadler of the opposition 's free-market liberal fdp and committee member . " we definitely have to deal with the issue , " he said , the welt am sonntag newspaper reported ahead of publication .
" there are a lot serious questions . " more than a few chin-ups ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was there more to the training then calisthenics ?
in order to keep german security authorities from participating in such illegal activities in the future , the government wants to raise the amount paid to authorities working under difficult circumstances , german newsweekly focus reported saturday . the move would increase the bonus paid to special forces members from 225 euros to 400 euros . accusations that seven of the eight men had violated official secrets laws , however , have proved unfounded , according to the frankfurter rundschau .
an inquiry continues into exactly what the eighth german told his students , prosecutor mathias proyer said . " we are investigating whether he had them doing a few chin-ups or if he taught them things he could have only learned during his training proyer told the paper . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 05.04.2008 germany celebrates 100 years of international soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-match beers and reticent fans marked germany 's international debut in 1908 one hundred years have passed since the german national soccer team took to the field in basel to play switzerland in its first competitive international game - but it might as well be a million . around 3,500 spectators turned out to see germany 's fledgling eagles take on switzerland on april 5 , 1908 , a fraction of those who now regularly support the national team on away matches .
the atmosphere was also light years away from today 's regularly raucous celebrations .
spectators at the landhof ground were told to refrain from making loud calls and female fans were treated to complimentary chocolates . the swiss , who had played their first game as a national team three years earlier , ran out 5-3 winners after 19-year-old fritz becker had opened the scoring for germany to become his nation 's first ever international goal scorer . fast forward to march 26 , 2008 and 38,500 rowdy spectators watched germany 's return to basel in their 800th game , where current coach joachim loew 's visitors trounced the home side 4-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 years on , germany exacted revenge in basel instead of sharing a few beers with the opposition before the game as was the case in 1908 , the germans spent the pre-match preparations in the company of their team of doctors , sports psychologists , physiotherapists , media specialists and even own their own cooks . pre-match boozing , free sweets for the ladies and reticent fans have long been consigned to the history books , along with germany 's early habit of losing too many consecutive matches . after the first game and defeat , germany waited over a year for their first victory , a 1-0 revenge win over the swiss in karlsruhe .
since then , while there have been losses - and thrashings , the largest being a 9-0 reverse against england two weeks before the national team 's first win - germany has built a reputation for well-disciplined success , even when not playing particularly well . germans cut from a different cloth " all germans come from the same factory , presumably the ironworks , " argentina 's world cup-winning coach cesar luis menotti once noted , commenting on the resilience of a long list of legendary players who never gave up and who are responsible in part for building a soccer legacy over the past 100 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz walter , one of the 1954 world cup winners players such as franz beckenbauer , uwe seeler , fritz walter , top scorer gerd mueller and lothar matthaeus , germany 's most-capped star , have come to epitomize the teutonic spirit that was forged in those early forays on the international scene and which eventually brought the national team world cup titles in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 as well as european championship triumphs in 1972 , 1980 and 1996 . as well as success in international tournaments , germany has been involved in some of the most memorable landmark matches in soccer history : a 3-2 triumph over hungary in the 1954 world cup final , the 1966 final they lost 4-2 against england , the heroic battle with italy they lost 4-3 in the 1970 semi-finals . germany also won the first penalty shoot-out at a world cup , against france in the 1982 semis .
fourteen years later germany also won the first major championship final decided by a golden goal , at euro 1996 over the czech republic . dfb celebrates a successful run germany have won 457 of the 800 matches played so far , with 164 draws and 179 defeats .
german teams scored 1,782 goals and conceded 965 .
in addition , an east german national team played 293 matches between 1952 and 1990 - famously beating west germany 1-0 at the 1974 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer 's 1990 world cup-winning team " we 've had quite a successful run , " german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger told the federation 's web site .
" just think about which accomplishments were triggered by soccer in germany , especially following world war ii .
soccer always moved the people living here , whether because of the many major triumphs or defeats .
we have really had an incredible journey . " consistency has always been a part of germany 's century of success .
the national team has only had 10 coaches in its 100 years of international competition , the legendary sepp herberger being the longest-serving .
the coach of the " heroes of bern " - germany 's first world cup winners in 1954 - held the post for 28 years .
his successors held tenures of ever-shortening length ; the last manager to leave office , juergen klinsmann , lasting just two years in another sign of how times have changed . team and federation grows together it has n't been just the national team which has developed into a success over the last 100 years .
the dfb was founded eight years before the national team was created but has enjoyed remarkable success in tandem with it over the past century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer in germany has exploded in the last century " obviously the dfb has grown in the last 100 years , " said thomas hackbarth , director of communications at the dfb .
" it is now one of the biggest sporting associations in europe , employing over 200 people across 21 regional offices and boasting 6.5 million members .
these are people who are or who have been actively involved with german soccer , both in a professional and amateur capacity . " another huge development in the last 100 years is the growth of women 's soccer and the dfb now has over 1 million female members , " hackbarth added .
" this is one of the reasons the 2011 women 's world cup was awarded to germany because the growth in the women 's game here has been phenomenal . " a century of organizational progress aside from the on-field success , germany and the dfb have become synonymous with preparatory perfection in the world of soccer .
as the game has developed over the last 100 years , both the team and the organization behind it have adapted to a changing landscape , culminating in the hugely successful hosting of the 2006 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " fan mile " was a landmark in world cup evolution " the 2006 world cup was a great success , not just with the national team 's performance , but the whole event , " hackbarth said .
" the dfb proved that it could handle the organization of such a massive event and create an atmosphere of inclusion , humor and safety . " the 2006 world cup was unrecognizable from the first world cup germany participated in 1934 , " he added .
" maybe in the next 100 years , the same thing will be said about 2006 . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spectators at the landhof ground were told to refrain from making loud calls and female fans were treated to complimentary chocolates . the swiss , who had played their first game as a national team three years earlier , ran out 5-3 winners after 19-year-old fritz becker had opened the scoring for germany to become his nation 's first ever international goal scorer . fast forward to march 26 , 2008 and 38,500 rowdy spectators watched germany 's return to basel in their 800th game , where current coach joachim loew 's visitors trounced the home side 4-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 years on , germany exacted revenge in basel instead of sharing a few beers with the opposition before the game as was the case in 1908 , the germans spent the pre-match preparations in the company of their team of doctors , sports psychologists , physiotherapists , media specialists and even own their own cooks . pre-match boozing , free sweets for the ladies and reticent fans have long been consigned to the history books , along with germany 's early habit of losing too many consecutive matches . after the first game and defeat , germany waited over a year for their first victory , a 1-0 revenge win over the swiss in karlsruhe .

neither party was able to form an alliance with their preferred partners , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens and left party for the spd .
at saturday 's opening session of the new parliament , none of the five parties presented a candidate to challenge koch , allowing him to continue as acting premier .
koch ran a divisive election campaign highlighting crimes committed by foreign youth .
he seized on a violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
his comments sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime he is now expected to try and persuade the greens to join him in a coalition at a later stage .
in his opening speech to parliament , the cdu leader promised an " open door " style of leadership in which all the parties would be regularly informed of the work of his government .
spd in disarray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti 's proposed deal with the left party proved her undoing ypsilanti withdrew her candidacy for the premiership last month after an spd deputy refused to back her plan for a deal with the left party .
the spd leader had sought the support of the left party to tolerate a coalition with the greens .
the greens won 9 seats in the elections , the fdp 11 and the left 6 .
the rise of the left , a far-left grouping which emerged from a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists , has shaken up the german political scene , forcing the main parties to seek arrangements with smaller parties they had previously kept at arm 's length .
in the city-state of hamburg , where the left won parliamentary representation on february 24 , the cdu is negotiating to form a coalition with the greens in what would be the first of its kind in germany .
at federal level , chancellor angela merkel 's cdu heads a " grand coalition " with the spd .
the two parties will face off in elections due in september 2009 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the event organized by the european trade union confederation -lrb- egb -rrb- drew between 10,000 and 30,000 protesters .
" this is a protest against the situation in the whole of europe , " reinhard dombre , head of germany 's trade union federation told reuters .
egb general secretary john monks said eu finance ministers and bankers had to understand the concerns of employees .
" we can not accept the sermons and lectures of european central bankers and finance ministers , " monks said .
" europe 's workers want their fair share . "
euro-zone finance ministers and central bankers , meeting for two days in slovenian town of brdo , warned on saturday that demands for big wage hikes could fuel a dangerous wage-inflation spiral .
the bundesbank , or german central bank , cautioned that recent hefty wage hikes in germany 's public sector would drive up the inflation rate , possibly forcing the bank to raise interest rates .
earlier this week german services union verdi - the biggest in the country - and public sector employers struck a deal on wage rises of around eight percent over two years for 1.3 million staff .
" enormous mistake to imitate germany " " the wage agreements are sharply higher than we expected , " bundesbank president axel weber told journalists . " we are going to have a close look at the -lsb- inflation -rsb- forecasts to see if public sector wage deals do n't make a revision necessary . "
weber added that those accords often set the tone for other pay negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's coup of an eight-percent pay hike has some finance experts alarmed " we are concerned about that , " he said , insisting that the german public sector was in a unique situation because it had gone without pay increases for several years .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet said the german public sector could not afford to serve as a model for other countries .
he stressed that wage development had to be in tandem with competitiveness and productivity of a country .
" a sensible wage policy is decisive for further growth in employment , " trichet said .
" it would be an enormous mistake to imitate germany . "
in the face of such inflation , euro-zone officials say that wage demands should not exceed productivity growth .
inflation at " incredible level " german finance minister peer steinbrueck however defended the strong pay rises in the public sector , saying the agreements followed job cuts and two years without net wage increases .
" employees have behaved very responsibly , they must have a share in the good economic development , " steinbrueck said .
jean-claude juncker , head of the euro zone countries finance ministers ' meetings , admitted that trade unions were right take into account inflation in their demands for higher wages , adding the weakest in society were hit the worst by price rises .
" those living on 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , 700 euros ca n't live with runaway inflation , " juncker said , adding that inflation was at an " incredible level . "
inflation in the 15 euro-zone countries jumped in march to 3.5 percent - the highest level since the bloc was formed in 1999 , according to official eu data earlier this week .
worst yet to come for beleaguered banks steinbrueck and weber , however , said the worst was yet to come for european banks reeling under the global financial crisis . banks can expect worse because " unlike last year they ca n't write down their losses against a very good first half year , " weber told news agency ap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche bank announced huge losses two of europe 's largest banks - swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank - recently announced massive first quarter losses .
steinbrueck warned that banks were still not honest enough about the effects of the global crisis .
" this is still not satisfactory , " steinbrueck said , adding that if banks intended to blame each other for financial woes they would end up in a tough situation .
germany can weather turmoil despite the banking turmoil , the german finance minister said he is sticking to his growth forecasts for the german economy in 2008 , even as the credit crisis dents global expansion .
" i think we can weather the financial turmoil to a wide extent , " steinbrueck said in an interview with bloomberg television .
" germany is going to face a growth rate of about 1.7 , 1.6 percent , " he said . the german economy is so far coping with the global slowdown caused by a us housing recession , a stronger euro and record oil prices .
investor , business and consumer confidence all unexpectedly increased last month and unemployment fell to the lowest in more than 15 years .
on economic growth , weber too sounded a positive note , saying he saw " no reason " to revise the bundesbank 's prediction for growth of 1.9 percent . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

neither party was able to form an alliance with their preferred partners , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens and left party for the spd .
at saturday 's opening session of the new parliament , none of the five parties presented a candidate to challenge koch , allowing him to continue as acting premier .
koch ran a divisive election campaign highlighting crimes committed by foreign youth .
he seized on a violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
his comments sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime he is now expected to try and persuade the greens to join him in a coalition at a later stage .
in his opening speech to parliament , the cdu leader promised an " open door " style of leadership in which all the parties would be regularly informed of the work of his government .
spd in disarray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti 's proposed deal with the left party proved her undoing ypsilanti withdrew her candidacy for the premiership last month after an spd deputy refused to back her plan for a deal with the left party .
the spd leader had sought the support of the left party to tolerate a coalition with the greens .
the greens won 9 seats in the elections , the fdp 11 and the left 6 .
the rise of the left , a far-left grouping which emerged from a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists , has shaken up the german political scene , forcing the main parties to seek arrangements with smaller parties they had previously kept at arm 's length .
in the city-state of hamburg , where the left won parliamentary representation on february 24 , the cdu is negotiating to form a coalition with the greens in what would be the first of its kind in germany .
at federal level , chancellor angela merkel 's cdu heads a " grand coalition " with the spd .
the two parties will face off in elections due in september 2009 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in a letter to fia president max mosley , the adac has distanced itself from events surrounding his person , " adac said . the 67-year-old son of former british fascist party leader oswald mosley , max mosley faces mounting pressure to resign ever since a british newspaper published raunchy details of his personal life . the british sunday newspaper news of the world alleged that mosley was involved in a nazi-style sex orgy with prostitutes in london last friday .
the newspaper posted a video on its web site , showing mosley having sex with five prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adac says mosley 's position has become untenable the adac said the role of an fia president who represents more than 100 million motorists worldwide should not be burdened by such an affair .
therefore , we ask the president to " very carefully reconsider his role within the organization , " the organization said .

" in a letter to fia president max mosley , the adac has distanced itself from events surrounding his person , " adac said . the 67-year-old son of former british fascist party leader oswald mosley , max mosley faces mounting pressure to resign ever since a british newspaper published raunchy details of his personal life . the british sunday newspaper news of the world alleged that mosley was involved in a nazi-style sex orgy with prostitutes in london last friday .
the newspaper posted a video on its web site , showing mosley having sex with five prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adac says mosley 's position has become untenable the adac said the role of an fia president who represents more than 100 million motorists worldwide should not be burdened by such an affair .
therefore , we ask the president to " very carefully reconsider his role within the organization , " the organization said . " it is in the interests of this world organization to carry on with its duties without the burden of this affair .

he pays 400 euros -lrb- $ 625 -rrb- a month for his gallery space on the brunnenstrasse , a street on the outskirts of the gentrified mitte neighborhood , currently billed as the hippest art avenue in town - and said he could never dream of such a low rent in london or paris .
friese is confident that the buzz will soon start to pay off .
" we 're hoping to see the emergence of a collectorship on the same scale as in cologne -lsb- the commercial center of the german art scene -rsb- , " he said .
" let 's wait five years , then we 'll see a change in the figures . "
he predicted that it wo n't be long before the cash starts to flow , and said a number of well-heeled collectors are moving to berlin - including christian boros , the hoffmanns , axel haubrock and wilhelm schuermann .
it 's good news for the contemporary art scene - but bound to leave the nay-sayers maintaining that berlin has lost its edge . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in a letter to fia president max mosley , the adac has distanced itself from events surrounding his person , " adac said . the 67-year-old son of former british fascist party leader oswald mosley , max mosley faces mounting pressure to resign ever since a british newspaper published raunchy details of his personal life . the british sunday newspaper news of the world alleged that mosley was involved in a nazi-style sex orgy with prostitutes in london last friday .
the newspaper posted a video on its web site , showing mosley having sex with five prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adac says mosley 's position has become untenable the adac said the role of an fia president who represents more than 100 million motorists worldwide should not be burdened by such an affair .
therefore , we ask the president to " very carefully reconsider his role within the organization , " the organization said . " it is in the interests of this world organization to carry on with its duties without the burden of this affair . " mosley denies nazi connotation mosley has not denied the incident took place , but insists there were no nazi overtones and he has done no wrong . mosley said he had written to adac , repeating an earlier statement that he would be suing the newspaper that published the story and posted the video on its website . the letter , parts of which were published on autosport.com , has been sent to all members of fia , as well as members of the world council for automobile mobility and tourism . he said that he would have resigned immediately had he been caught speeding or driving over the alcohol limit . " as it is , a scandal paper obtained by illegal means pictures of something i did in private which , although unacceptable to some people , was harmless and completely legal , " mosley said .
" it goes without saying that the so-called nazi element is pure fabrication .
this will become crystal clear when the matter comes to trial .
the newspaper invented this in order to spice up their story and introduce my family background , " he wrote in the letter to adac . " in short , i think i have done nothing wrong and that the wrong was done by the newspaper : " motorsport leading lights urge mosley to quit however , mosley faces a growing chorus of calls from the motorsport world and leading carmakers to step down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the motorsport world want mosley to go bmw , mercedes-benz , honda and toyota have all issued statements distancing themselves from the affair and calling for mosley to act. former racing drivers such as three-time world champion jackie steward and south african world champion jody scheckter have called for mosley to resign . they were joined on friday by the world 's largest auto club , the american automobile association -lrb- aaa -rrb- . " aaa recognizes that mr mosley has dedicated many years of his life to advancing the interests of mobility and motorsport .
however , after careful consideration , aaa has conveyed to mr mosley that it would be in the best interest of all concerned if he were to step down , " aaa public relations managing director yolanda clark was quoted as saying by news reports . clark named the damage done by the revelations about mosley " clearly public . " she said that the fia and its leader " must uphold the highest standards of ethical behavior to exercise the moral authority required to represent millions of motorists .

the event organized by the european trade union confederation -lrb- egb -rrb- drew between 10,000 and 30,000 protesters .
" this is a protest against the situation in the whole of europe , " reinhard dombre , head of germany 's trade union federation told reuters .
egb general secretary john monks said eu finance ministers and bankers had to understand the concerns of employees .
" we can not accept the sermons and lectures of european central bankers and finance ministers , " monks said .
" europe 's workers want their fair share . "
euro-zone finance ministers and central bankers , meeting for two days in slovenian town of brdo , warned on saturday that demands for big wage hikes could fuel a dangerous wage-inflation spiral .
the bundesbank , or german central bank , cautioned that recent hefty wage hikes in germany 's public sector would drive up the inflation rate , possibly forcing the bank to raise interest rates .
earlier this week german services union verdi - the biggest in the country - and public sector employers struck a deal on wage rises of around eight percent over two years for 1.3 million staff .
" enormous mistake to imitate germany " " the wage agreements are sharply higher than we expected , " bundesbank president axel weber told journalists . " we are going to have a close look at the -lsb- inflation -rsb- forecasts to see if public sector wage deals do n't make a revision necessary . "
weber added that those accords often set the tone for other pay negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's coup of an eight-percent pay hike has some finance experts alarmed " we are concerned about that , " he said , insisting that the german public sector was in a unique situation because it had gone without pay increases for several years .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet said the german public sector could not afford to serve as a model for other countries .
he stressed that wage development had to be in tandem with competitiveness and productivity of a country .
" a sensible wage policy is decisive for further growth in employment , " trichet said .
" it would be an enormous mistake to imitate germany . "
in the face of such inflation , euro-zone officials say that wage demands should not exceed productivity growth .
inflation at " incredible level " german finance minister peer steinbrueck however defended the strong pay rises in the public sector , saying the agreements followed job cuts and two years without net wage increases .
" employees have behaved very responsibly , they must have a share in the good economic development , " steinbrueck said .
jean-claude juncker , head of the euro zone countries finance ministers ' meetings , admitted that trade unions were right take into account inflation in their demands for higher wages , adding the weakest in society were hit the worst by price rises .
" those living on 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , 700 euros ca n't live with runaway inflation , " juncker said , adding that inflation was at an " incredible level . "
inflation in the 15 euro-zone countries jumped in march to 3.5 percent - the highest level since the bloc was formed in 1999 , according to official eu data earlier this week .
worst yet to come for beleaguered banks steinbrueck and weber , however , said the worst was yet to come for european banks reeling under the global financial crisis . banks can expect worse because " unlike last year they ca n't write down their losses against a very good first half year , " weber told news agency ap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche bank announced huge losses two of europe 's largest banks - swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank - recently announced massive first quarter losses .
steinbrueck warned that banks were still not honest enough about the effects of the global crisis .
" this is still not satisfactory , " steinbrueck said , adding that if banks intended to blame each other for financial woes they would end up in a tough situation .
germany can weather turmoil despite the banking turmoil , the german finance minister said he is sticking to his growth forecasts for the german economy in 2008 , even as the credit crisis dents global expansion .
" i think we can weather the financial turmoil to a wide extent , " steinbrueck said in an interview with bloomberg television .
" germany is going to face a growth rate of about 1.7 , 1.6 percent , " he said . the german economy is so far coping with the global slowdown caused by a us housing recession , a stronger euro and record oil prices .
investor , business and consumer confidence all unexpectedly increased last month and unemployment fell to the lowest in more than 15 years .
on economic growth , weber too sounded a positive note , saying he saw " no reason " to revise the bundesbank 's prediction for growth of 1.9 percent . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

neither party was able to form an alliance with their preferred partners , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens and left party for the spd .
at saturday 's opening session of the new parliament , none of the five parties presented a candidate to challenge koch , allowing him to continue as acting premier .
koch ran a divisive election campaign highlighting crimes committed by foreign youth .
he seized on a violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
his comments sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime he is now expected to try and persuade the greens to join him in a coalition at a later stage .
in his opening speech to parliament , the cdu leader promised an " open door " style of leadership in which all the parties would be regularly informed of the work of his government .
spd in disarray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti 's proposed deal with the left party proved her undoing ypsilanti withdrew her candidacy for the premiership last month after an spd deputy refused to back her plan for a deal with the left party .
the spd leader had sought the support of the left party to tolerate a coalition with the greens .
the greens won 9 seats in the elections , the fdp 11 and the left 6 .
the rise of the left , a far-left grouping which emerged from a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists , has shaken up the german political scene , forcing the main parties to seek arrangements with smaller parties they had previously kept at arm 's length .
in the city-state of hamburg , where the left won parliamentary representation on february 24 , the cdu is negotiating to form a coalition with the greens in what would be the first of its kind in germany .
at federal level , chancellor angela merkel 's cdu heads a " grand coalition " with the spd .

at saturday 's opening session of the new parliament , none of the five parties presented a candidate to challenge koch , allowing him to continue as acting premier .
koch ran a divisive election campaign highlighting crimes committed by foreign youth .
he seized on a violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
his comments sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime he is now expected to try and persuade the greens to join him in a coalition at a later stage .
in his opening speech to parliament , the cdu leader promised an " open door " style of leadership in which all the parties would be regularly informed of the work of his government .
spd in disarray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti 's proposed deal with the left party proved her undoing ypsilanti withdrew her candidacy for the premiership last month after an spd deputy refused to back her plan for a deal with the left party .
the spd leader had sought the support of the left party to tolerate a coalition with the greens .
the greens won 9 seats in the elections , the fdp 11 and the left 6 .
the rise of the left , a far-left grouping which emerged from a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists , has shaken up the german political scene , forcing the main parties to seek arrangements with smaller parties they had previously kept at arm 's length .
in the city-state of hamburg , where the left won parliamentary representation on february 24 , the cdu is negotiating to form a coalition with the greens in what would be the first of its kind in germany .
at federal level , chancellor angela merkel 's cdu heads a " grand coalition " with the spd .
the two parties will face off in elections due in september 2009 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 05.04.2008 germany celebrates 100 years of international soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-match beers and reticent fans marked germany 's international debut in 1908 one hundred years have passed since the german national soccer team took to the field in basel to play switzerland in its first competitive international game - but it might as well be a million . around 3,500 spectators turned out to see germany 's fledgling eagles take on switzerland on april 5 , 1908 , a fraction of those who now regularly support the national team on away matches .
the atmosphere was also light years away from today 's regularly raucous celebrations .
spectators at the landhof ground were told to refrain from making loud calls and female fans were treated to complimentary chocolates . the swiss , who had played their first game as a national team three years earlier , ran out 5-3 winners after 19-year-old fritz becker had opened the scoring for germany to become his nation 's first ever international goal scorer . fast forward to march 26 , 2008 and 38,500 rowdy spectators watched germany 's return to basel in their 800th game , where current coach joachim loew 's visitors trounced the home side 4-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 years on , germany exacted revenge in basel instead of sharing a few beers with the opposition before the game as was the case in 1908 , the germans spent the pre-match preparations in the company of their team of doctors , sports psychologists , physiotherapists , media specialists and even own their own cooks . pre-match boozing , free sweets for the ladies and reticent fans have long been consigned to the history books , along with germany 's early habit of losing too many consecutive matches . after the first game and defeat , germany waited over a year for their first victory , a 1-0 revenge win over the swiss in karlsruhe .
since then , while there have been losses - and thrashings , the largest being a 9-0 reverse against england two weeks before the national team 's first win - germany has built a reputation for well-disciplined success , even when not playing particularly well . germans cut from a different cloth " all germans come from the same factory , presumably the ironworks , " argentina 's world cup-winning coach cesar luis menotti once noted , commenting on the resilience of a long list of legendary players who never gave up and who are responsible in part for building a soccer legacy over the past 100 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz walter , one of the 1954 world cup winners players such as franz beckenbauer , uwe seeler , fritz walter , top scorer gerd mueller and lothar matthaeus , germany 's most-capped star , have come to epitomize the teutonic spirit that was forged in those early forays on the international scene and which eventually brought the national team world cup titles in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 as well as european championship triumphs in 1972 , 1980 and 1996 . as well as success in international tournaments , germany has been involved in some of the most memorable landmark matches in soccer history : a 3-2 triumph over hungary in the 1954 world cup final , the 1966 final they lost 4-2 against england , the heroic battle with italy they lost 4-3 in the 1970 semi-finals . germany also won the first penalty shoot-out at a world cup , against france in the 1982 semis .
fourteen years later germany also won the first major championship final decided by a golden goal , at euro 1996 over the czech republic . dfb celebrates a successful run germany have won 457 of the 800 matches played so far , with 164 draws and 179 defeats .
german teams scored 1,782 goals and conceded 965 .
in addition , an east german national team played 293 matches between 1952 and 1990 - famously beating west germany 1-0 at the 1974 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer 's 1990 world cup-winning team " we 've had quite a successful run , " german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger told the federation 's web site .
" just think about which accomplishments were triggered by soccer in germany , especially following world war ii .
soccer always moved the people living here , whether because of the many major triumphs or defeats .
we have really had an incredible journey . " consistency has always been a part of germany 's century of success .
the national team has only had 10 coaches in its 100 years of international competition , the legendary sepp herberger being the longest-serving .
the coach of the " heroes of bern " - germany 's first world cup winners in 1954 - held the post for 28 years .
his successors held tenures of ever-shortening length ; the last manager to leave office , juergen klinsmann , lasting just two years in another sign of how times have changed . team and federation grows together it has n't been just the national team which has developed into a success over the last 100 years .
the dfb was founded eight years before the national team was created but has enjoyed remarkable success in tandem with it over the past century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer in germany has exploded in the last century " obviously the dfb has grown in the last 100 years , " said thomas hackbarth , director of communications at the dfb .
" it is now one of the biggest sporting associations in europe , employing over 200 people across 21 regional offices and boasting 6.5 million members .
these are people who are or who have been actively involved with german soccer , both in a professional and amateur capacity . " another huge development in the last 100 years is the growth of women 's soccer and the dfb now has over 1 million female members , " hackbarth added .
" this is one of the reasons the 2011 women 's world cup was awarded to germany because the growth in the women 's game here has been phenomenal . " a century of organizational progress aside from the on-field success , germany and the dfb have become synonymous with preparatory perfection in the world of soccer .
as the game has developed over the last 100 years , both the team and the organization behind it have adapted to a changing landscape , culminating in the hugely successful hosting of the 2006 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " fan mile " was a landmark in world cup evolution " the 2006 world cup was a great success , not just with the national team 's performance , but the whole event , " hackbarth said .
" the dfb proved that it could handle the organization of such a massive event and create an atmosphere of inclusion , humor and safety . " the 2006 world cup was unrecognizable from the first world cup germany participated in 1934 , " he added .
" maybe in the next 100 years , the same thing will be said about 2006 . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in a letter to fia president max mosley , the adac has distanced itself from events surrounding his person , " adac said . the 67-year-old son of former british fascist party leader oswald mosley , max mosley faces mounting pressure to resign ever since a british newspaper published raunchy details of his personal life . the british sunday newspaper news of the world alleged that mosley was involved in a nazi-style sex orgy with prostitutes in london last friday .
the newspaper posted a video on its web site , showing mosley having sex with five prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adac says mosley 's position has become untenable the adac said the role of an fia president who represents more than 100 million motorists worldwide should not be burdened by such an affair .
therefore , we ask the president to " very carefully reconsider his role within the organization , " the organization said . " it is in the interests of this world organization to carry on with its duties without the burden of this affair . " mosley denies nazi connotation mosley has not denied the incident took place , but insists there were no nazi overtones and he has done no wrong . mosley said he had written to adac , repeating an earlier statement that he would be suing the newspaper that published the story and posted the video on its website . the letter , parts of which were published on autosport.com , has been sent to all members of fia , as well as members of the world council for automobile mobility and tourism . he said that he would have resigned immediately had he been caught speeding or driving over the alcohol limit . " as it is , a scandal paper obtained by illegal means pictures of something i did in private which , although unacceptable to some people , was harmless and completely legal , " mosley said .
" it goes without saying that the so-called nazi element is pure fabrication .
this will become crystal clear when the matter comes to trial .
the newspaper invented this in order to spice up their story and introduce my family background , " he wrote in the letter to adac . " in short , i think i have done nothing wrong and that the wrong was done by the newspaper : " motorsport leading lights urge mosley to quit however , mosley faces a growing chorus of calls from the motorsport world and leading carmakers to step down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the motorsport world want mosley to go bmw , mercedes-benz , honda and toyota have all issued statements distancing themselves from the affair and calling for mosley to act. former racing drivers such as three-time world champion jackie steward and south african world champion jody scheckter have called for mosley to resign . they were joined on friday by the world 's largest auto club , the american automobile association -lrb- aaa -rrb- . " aaa recognizes that mr mosley has dedicated many years of his life to advancing the interests of mobility and motorsport .
however , after careful consideration , aaa has conveyed to mr mosley that it would be in the best interest of all concerned if he were to step down , " aaa public relations managing director yolanda clark was quoted as saying by news reports . clark named the damage done by the revelations about mosley " clearly public . " she said that the fia and its leader " must uphold the highest standards of ethical behavior to exercise the moral authority required to represent millions of motorists .

the event organized by the european trade union confederation -lrb- egb -rrb- drew between 10,000 and 30,000 protesters .
" this is a protest against the situation in the whole of europe , " reinhard dombre , head of germany 's trade union federation told reuters .
egb general secretary john monks said eu finance ministers and bankers had to understand the concerns of employees .
" we can not accept the sermons and lectures of european central bankers and finance ministers , " monks said .
" europe 's workers want their fair share . "
euro-zone finance ministers and central bankers , meeting for two days in slovenian town of brdo , warned on saturday that demands for big wage hikes could fuel a dangerous wage-inflation spiral .
the bundesbank , or german central bank , cautioned that recent hefty wage hikes in germany 's public sector would drive up the inflation rate , possibly forcing the bank to raise interest rates .
earlier this week german services union verdi - the biggest in the country - and public sector employers struck a deal on wage rises of around eight percent over two years for 1.3 million staff .
" enormous mistake to imitate germany " " the wage agreements are sharply higher than we expected , " bundesbank president axel weber told journalists . " we are going to have a close look at the -lsb- inflation -rsb- forecasts to see if public sector wage deals do n't make a revision necessary . "
weber added that those accords often set the tone for other pay negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's coup of an eight-percent pay hike has some finance experts alarmed " we are concerned about that , " he said , insisting that the german public sector was in a unique situation because it had gone without pay increases for several years .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet said the german public sector could not afford to serve as a model for other countries .
he stressed that wage development had to be in tandem with competitiveness and productivity of a country .
" a sensible wage policy is decisive for further growth in employment , " trichet said .
" it would be an enormous mistake to imitate germany . "
in the face of such inflation , euro-zone officials say that wage demands should not exceed productivity growth .
inflation at " incredible level " german finance minister peer steinbrueck however defended the strong pay rises in the public sector , saying the agreements followed job cuts and two years without net wage increases .
" employees have behaved very responsibly , they must have a share in the good economic development , " steinbrueck said .
jean-claude juncker , head of the euro zone countries finance ministers ' meetings , admitted that trade unions were right take into account inflation in their demands for higher wages , adding the weakest in society were hit the worst by price rises .
" those living on 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , 700 euros ca n't live with runaway inflation , " juncker said , adding that inflation was at an " incredible level . "
inflation in the 15 euro-zone countries jumped in march to 3.5 percent - the highest level since the bloc was formed in 1999 , according to official eu data earlier this week .
worst yet to come for beleaguered banks steinbrueck and weber , however , said the worst was yet to come for european banks reeling under the global financial crisis . banks can expect worse because " unlike last year they ca n't write down their losses against a very good first half year , " weber told news agency ap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche bank announced huge losses two of europe 's largest banks - swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank - recently announced massive first quarter losses .
steinbrueck warned that banks were still not honest enough about the effects of the global crisis .
" this is still not satisfactory , " steinbrueck said , adding that if banks intended to blame each other for financial woes they would end up in a tough situation .
germany can weather turmoil despite the banking turmoil , the german finance minister said he is sticking to his growth forecasts for the german economy in 2008 , even as the credit crisis dents global expansion .
" i think we can weather the financial turmoil to a wide extent , " steinbrueck said in an interview with bloomberg television .
" germany is going to face a growth rate of about 1.7 , 1.6 percent , " he said . the german economy is so far coping with the global slowdown caused by a us housing recession , a stronger euro and record oil prices .
investor , business and consumer confidence all unexpectedly increased last month and unemployment fell to the lowest in more than 15 years .

the event organized by the european trade union confederation -lrb- egb -rrb- drew between 10,000 and 30,000 protesters .
" this is a protest against the situation in the whole of europe , " reinhard dombre , head of germany 's trade union federation told reuters .
egb general secretary john monks said eu finance ministers and bankers had to understand the concerns of employees .
" we can not accept the sermons and lectures of european central bankers and finance ministers , " monks said .
" europe 's workers want their fair share . "
euro-zone finance ministers and central bankers , meeting for two days in slovenian town of brdo , warned on saturday that demands for big wage hikes could fuel a dangerous wage-inflation spiral .
the bundesbank , or german central bank , cautioned that recent hefty wage hikes in germany 's public sector would drive up the inflation rate , possibly forcing the bank to raise interest rates .
earlier this week german services union verdi - the biggest in the country - and public sector employers struck a deal on wage rises of around eight percent over two years for 1.3 million staff .
" enormous mistake to imitate germany " " the wage agreements are sharply higher than we expected , " bundesbank president axel weber told journalists . " we are going to have a close look at the -lsb- inflation -rsb- forecasts to see if public sector wage deals do n't make a revision necessary . "
weber added that those accords often set the tone for other pay negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's coup of an eight-percent pay hike has some finance experts alarmed " we are concerned about that , " he said , insisting that the german public sector was in a unique situation because it had gone without pay increases for several years .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet said the german public sector could not afford to serve as a model for other countries .
he stressed that wage development had to be in tandem with competitiveness and productivity of a country .
" a sensible wage policy is decisive for further growth in employment , " trichet said .
" it would be an enormous mistake to imitate germany . "
in the face of such inflation , euro-zone officials say that wage demands should not exceed productivity growth .
inflation at " incredible level " german finance minister peer steinbrueck however defended the strong pay rises in the public sector , saying the agreements followed job cuts and two years without net wage increases .
" employees have behaved very responsibly , they must have a share in the good economic development , " steinbrueck said .
jean-claude juncker , head of the euro zone countries finance ministers ' meetings , admitted that trade unions were right take into account inflation in their demands for higher wages , adding the weakest in society were hit the worst by price rises .
" those living on 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , 700 euros ca n't live with runaway inflation , " juncker said , adding that inflation was at an " incredible level . "
inflation in the 15 euro-zone countries jumped in march to 3.5 percent - the highest level since the bloc was formed in 1999 , according to official eu data earlier this week .
worst yet to come for beleaguered banks steinbrueck and weber , however , said the worst was yet to come for european banks reeling under the global financial crisis . banks can expect worse because " unlike last year they ca n't write down their losses against a very good first half year , " weber told news agency ap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche bank announced huge losses two of europe 's largest banks - swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank - recently announced massive first quarter losses .
steinbrueck warned that banks were still not honest enough about the effects of the global crisis .
" this is still not satisfactory , " steinbrueck said , adding that if banks intended to blame each other for financial woes they would end up in a tough situation .
germany can weather turmoil despite the banking turmoil , the german finance minister said he is sticking to his growth forecasts for the german economy in 2008 , even as the credit crisis dents global expansion .
" i think we can weather the financial turmoil to a wide extent , " steinbrueck said in an interview with bloomberg television .
" germany is going to face a growth rate of about 1.7 , 1.6 percent , " he said . the german economy is so far coping with the global slowdown caused by a us housing recession , a stronger euro and record oil prices .
investor , business and consumer confidence all unexpectedly increased last month and unemployment fell to the lowest in more than 15 years .
on economic growth , weber too sounded a positive note , saying he saw " no reason " to revise the bundesbank 's prediction for growth of 1.9 percent . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the event organized by the european trade union confederation -lrb- egb -rrb- drew between 10,000 and 30,000 protesters .
" this is a protest against the situation in the whole of europe , " reinhard dombre , head of germany 's trade union federation told reuters .
egb general secretary john monks said eu finance ministers and bankers had to understand the concerns of employees .
" we can not accept the sermons and lectures of european central bankers and finance ministers , " monks said .
" europe 's workers want their fair share . "
euro-zone finance ministers and central bankers , meeting for two days in slovenian town of brdo , warned on saturday that demands for big wage hikes could fuel a dangerous wage-inflation spiral .
the bundesbank , or german central bank , cautioned that recent hefty wage hikes in germany 's public sector would drive up the inflation rate , possibly forcing the bank to raise interest rates .
earlier this week german services union verdi - the biggest in the country - and public sector employers struck a deal on wage rises of around eight percent over two years for 1.3 million staff .
" enormous mistake to imitate germany " " the wage agreements are sharply higher than we expected , " bundesbank president axel weber told journalists . " we are going to have a close look at the -lsb- inflation -rsb- forecasts to see if public sector wage deals do n't make a revision necessary . "
weber added that those accords often set the tone for other pay negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's coup of an eight-percent pay hike has some finance experts alarmed " we are concerned about that , " he said , insisting that the german public sector was in a unique situation because it had gone without pay increases for several years .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet said the german public sector could not afford to serve as a model for other countries .
he stressed that wage development had to be in tandem with competitiveness and productivity of a country .
" a sensible wage policy is decisive for further growth in employment , " trichet said .
" it would be an enormous mistake to imitate germany . "
in the face of such inflation , euro-zone officials say that wage demands should not exceed productivity growth .
inflation at " incredible level " german finance minister peer steinbrueck however defended the strong pay rises in the public sector , saying the agreements followed job cuts and two years without net wage increases .
" employees have behaved very responsibly , they must have a share in the good economic development , " steinbrueck said .
jean-claude juncker , head of the euro zone countries finance ministers ' meetings , admitted that trade unions were right take into account inflation in their demands for higher wages , adding the weakest in society were hit the worst by price rises .
" those living on 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , 700 euros ca n't live with runaway inflation , " juncker said , adding that inflation was at an " incredible level . "
inflation in the 15 euro-zone countries jumped in march to 3.5 percent - the highest level since the bloc was formed in 1999 , according to official eu data earlier this week .
worst yet to come for beleaguered banks steinbrueck and weber , however , said the worst was yet to come for european banks reeling under the global financial crisis . banks can expect worse because " unlike last year they ca n't write down their losses against a very good first half year , " weber told news agency ap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche bank announced huge losses two of europe 's largest banks - swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank - recently announced massive first quarter losses .
steinbrueck warned that banks were still not honest enough about the effects of the global crisis .
" this is still not satisfactory , " steinbrueck said , adding that if banks intended to blame each other for financial woes they would end up in a tough situation .
germany can weather turmoil despite the banking turmoil , the german finance minister said he is sticking to his growth forecasts for the german economy in 2008 , even as the credit crisis dents global expansion .
" i think we can weather the financial turmoil to a wide extent , " steinbrueck said in an interview with bloomberg television .
" germany is going to face a growth rate of about 1.7 , 1.6 percent , " he said . the german economy is so far coping with the global slowdown caused by a us housing recession , a stronger euro and record oil prices .
investor , business and consumer confidence all unexpectedly increased last month and unemployment fell to the lowest in more than 15 years .
on economic growth , weber too sounded a positive note , saying he saw " no reason " to revise the bundesbank 's prediction for growth of 1.9 percent . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

neither party was able to form an alliance with their preferred partners , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens and left party for the spd .
at saturday 's opening session of the new parliament , none of the five parties presented a candidate to challenge koch , allowing him to continue as acting premier .
koch ran a divisive election campaign highlighting crimes committed by foreign youth .
he seized on a violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
his comments sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime he is now expected to try and persuade the greens to join him in a coalition at a later stage .
in his opening speech to parliament , the cdu leader promised an " open door " style of leadership in which all the parties would be regularly informed of the work of his government .
spd in disarray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti 's proposed deal with the left party proved her undoing ypsilanti withdrew her candidacy for the premiership last month after an spd deputy refused to back her plan for a deal with the left party .
the spd leader had sought the support of the left party to tolerate a coalition with the greens .
the greens won 9 seats in the elections , the fdp 11 and the left 6 .
the rise of the left , a far-left grouping which emerged from a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists , has shaken up the german political scene , forcing the main parties to seek arrangements with smaller parties they had previously kept at arm 's length .
in the city-state of hamburg , where the left won parliamentary representation on february 24 , the cdu is negotiating to form a coalition with the greens in what would be the first of its kind in germany .
at federal level , chancellor angela merkel 's cdu heads a " grand coalition " with the spd .
the two parties will face off in elections due in september 2009 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but cultivating creativity is one thing - getting buyers to spend is another matter . berlin played a key role in european art throughout the 20th century , spawning generations of avant-garde artists and inspiring many of the revolutionary movements that shaped the art world in the last 100 years .

" a city that plays host to key events , be they political , social or artistic , will always attract plenty of international artists . "
thomas schulte , another berlin gallery owner , noted in the international herald tribune last month that the german capital has a history of attracting foreign artists that dates back to the 1920s .

" most of the international artists have moved to berlin because apartments and studios are still relatively cheap , " he said .
he pays 400 euros -lrb- $ 625 -rrb- a month for his gallery space on the brunnenstrasse , a street on the outskirts of the gentrified mitte neighborhood , currently billed as the hippest art avenue in town - and said he could never dream of such a low rent in london or paris .
friese is confident that the buzz will soon start to pay off .
" we 're hoping to see the emergence of a collectorship on the same scale as in cologne -lsb- the commercial center of the german art scene -rsb- , " he said .
" let 's wait five years , then we 'll see a change in the figures . "
he predicted that it wo n't be long before the cash starts to flow , and said a number of well-heeled collectors are moving to berlin - including christian boros , the hoffmanns , axel haubrock and wilhelm schuermann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 05.04.2008 germany celebrates 100 years of international soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-match beers and reticent fans marked germany 's international debut in 1908 one hundred years have passed since the german national soccer team took to the field in basel to play switzerland in its first competitive international game - but it might as well be a million . around 3,500 spectators turned out to see germany 's fledgling eagles take on switzerland on april 5 , 1908 , a fraction of those who now regularly support the national team on away matches .
the atmosphere was also light years away from today 's regularly raucous celebrations .
spectators at the landhof ground were told to refrain from making loud calls and female fans were treated to complimentary chocolates . the swiss , who had played their first game as a national team three years earlier , ran out 5-3 winners after 19-year-old fritz becker had opened the scoring for germany to become his nation 's first ever international goal scorer . fast forward to march 26 , 2008 and 38,500 rowdy spectators watched germany 's return to basel in their 800th game , where current coach joachim loew 's visitors trounced the home side 4-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 years on , germany exacted revenge in basel instead of sharing a few beers with the opposition before the game as was the case in 1908 , the germans spent the pre-match preparations in the company of their team of doctors , sports psychologists , physiotherapists , media specialists and even own their own cooks . pre-match boozing , free sweets for the ladies and reticent fans have long been consigned to the history books , along with germany 's early habit of losing too many consecutive matches . after the first game and defeat , germany waited over a year for their first victory , a 1-0 revenge win over the swiss in karlsruhe .
since then , while there have been losses - and thrashings , the largest being a 9-0 reverse against england two weeks before the national team 's first win - germany has built a reputation for well-disciplined success , even when not playing particularly well . germans cut from a different cloth " all germans come from the same factory , presumably the ironworks , " argentina 's world cup-winning coach cesar luis menotti once noted , commenting on the resilience of a long list of legendary players who never gave up and who are responsible in part for building a soccer legacy over the past 100 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz walter , one of the 1954 world cup winners players such as franz beckenbauer , uwe seeler , fritz walter , top scorer gerd mueller and lothar matthaeus , germany 's most-capped star , have come to epitomize the teutonic spirit that was forged in those early forays on the international scene and which eventually brought the national team world cup titles in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 as well as european championship triumphs in 1972 , 1980 and 1996 . as well as success in international tournaments , germany has been involved in some of the most memorable landmark matches in soccer history : a 3-2 triumph over hungary in the 1954 world cup final , the 1966 final they lost 4-2 against england , the heroic battle with italy they lost 4-3 in the 1970 semi-finals . germany also won the first penalty shoot-out at a world cup , against france in the 1982 semis .
fourteen years later germany also won the first major championship final decided by a golden goal , at euro 1996 over the czech republic . dfb celebrates a successful run germany have won 457 of the 800 matches played so far , with 164 draws and 179 defeats .
german teams scored 1,782 goals and conceded 965 .
in addition , an east german national team played 293 matches between 1952 and 1990 - famously beating west germany 1-0 at the 1974 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer 's 1990 world cup-winning team " we 've had quite a successful run , " german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger told the federation 's web site .
" just think about which accomplishments were triggered by soccer in germany , especially following world war ii .
soccer always moved the people living here , whether because of the many major triumphs or defeats .
we have really had an incredible journey . " consistency has always been a part of germany 's century of success .
the national team has only had 10 coaches in its 100 years of international competition , the legendary sepp herberger being the longest-serving .
the coach of the " heroes of bern " - germany 's first world cup winners in 1954 - held the post for 28 years .
his successors held tenures of ever-shortening length ; the last manager to leave office , juergen klinsmann , lasting just two years in another sign of how times have changed . team and federation grows together it has n't been just the national team which has developed into a success over the last 100 years .
the dfb was founded eight years before the national team was created but has enjoyed remarkable success in tandem with it over the past century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer in germany has exploded in the last century " obviously the dfb has grown in the last 100 years , " said thomas hackbarth , director of communications at the dfb .
" it is now one of the biggest sporting associations in europe , employing over 200 people across 21 regional offices and boasting 6.5 million members .
these are people who are or who have been actively involved with german soccer , both in a professional and amateur capacity . " another huge development in the last 100 years is the growth of women 's soccer and the dfb now has over 1 million female members , " hackbarth added .
" this is one of the reasons the 2011 women 's world cup was awarded to germany because the growth in the women 's game here has been phenomenal . " a century of organizational progress aside from the on-field success , germany and the dfb have become synonymous with preparatory perfection in the world of soccer .
as the game has developed over the last 100 years , both the team and the organization behind it have adapted to a changing landscape , culminating in the hugely successful hosting of the 2006 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " fan mile " was a landmark in world cup evolution " the 2006 world cup was a great success , not just with the national team 's performance , but the whole event , " hackbarth said .
" the dfb proved that it could handle the organization of such a massive event and create an atmosphere of inclusion , humor and safety . " the 2006 world cup was unrecognizable from the first world cup germany participated in 1934 , " he added .
" maybe in the next 100 years , the same thing will be said about 2006 . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spectators at the landhof ground were told to refrain from making loud calls and female fans were treated to complimentary chocolates . the swiss , who had played their first game as a national team three years earlier , ran out 5-3 winners after 19-year-old fritz becker had opened the scoring for germany to become his nation 's first ever international goal scorer . fast forward to march 26 , 2008 and 38,500 rowdy spectators watched germany 's return to basel in their 800th game , where current coach joachim loew 's visitors trounced the home side 4-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 years on , germany exacted revenge in basel instead of sharing a few beers with the opposition before the game as was the case in 1908 , the germans spent the pre-match preparations in the company of their team of doctors , sports psychologists , physiotherapists , media specialists and even own their own cooks . pre-match boozing , free sweets for the ladies and reticent fans have long been consigned to the history books , along with germany 's early habit of losing too many consecutive matches . after the first game and defeat , germany waited over a year for their first victory , a 1-0 revenge win over the swiss in karlsruhe .
since then , while there have been losses - and thrashings , the largest being a 9-0 reverse against england two weeks before the national team 's first win - germany has built a reputation for well-disciplined success , even when not playing particularly well . germans cut from a different cloth " all germans come from the same factory , presumably the ironworks , " argentina 's world cup-winning coach cesar luis menotti once noted , commenting on the resilience of a long list of legendary players who never gave up and who are responsible in part for building a soccer legacy over the past 100 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz walter , one of the 1954 world cup winners players such as franz beckenbauer , uwe seeler , fritz walter , top scorer gerd mueller and lothar matthaeus , germany 's most-capped star , have come to epitomize the teutonic spirit that was forged in those early forays on the international scene and which eventually brought the national team world cup titles in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 as well as european championship triumphs in 1972 , 1980 and 1996 . as well as success in international tournaments , germany has been involved in some of the most memorable landmark matches in soccer history : a 3-2 triumph over hungary in the 1954 world cup final , the 1966 final they lost 4-2 against england , the heroic battle with italy they lost 4-3 in the 1970 semi-finals . germany also won the first penalty shoot-out at a world cup , against france in the 1982 semis .
fourteen years later germany also won the first major championship final decided by a golden goal , at euro 1996 over the czech republic . dfb celebrates a successful run germany have won 457 of the 800 matches played so far , with 164 draws and 179 defeats .

the national team has only had 10 coaches in its 100 years of international competition , the legendary sepp herberger being the longest-serving .
the coach of the " heroes of bern " - germany 's first world cup winners in 1954 - held the post for 28 years .
his successors held tenures of ever-shortening length ; the last manager to leave office , juergen klinsmann , lasting just two years in another sign of how times have changed . team and federation grows together it has n't been just the national team which has developed into a success over the last 100 years .

" it is now one of the biggest sporting associations in europe , employing over 200 people across 21 regional offices and boasting 6.5 million members .
these are people who are or who have been actively involved with german soccer , both in a professional and amateur capacity . " another huge development in the last 100 years is the growth of women 's soccer and the dfb now has over 1 million female members , " hackbarth added .
" this is one of the reasons the 2011 women 's world cup was awarded to germany because the growth in the women 's game here has been phenomenal . " a century of organizational progress aside from the on-field success , germany and the dfb have become synonymous with preparatory perfection in the world of soccer .

spectators at the landhof ground were told to refrain from making loud calls and female fans were treated to complimentary chocolates . the swiss , who had played their first game as a national team three years earlier , ran out 5-3 winners after 19-year-old fritz becker had opened the scoring for germany to become his nation 's first ever international goal scorer . fast forward to march 26 , 2008 and 38,500 rowdy spectators watched germany 's return to basel in their 800th game , where current coach joachim loew 's visitors trounced the home side 4-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 100 years on , germany exacted revenge in basel instead of sharing a few beers with the opposition before the game as was the case in 1908 , the germans spent the pre-match preparations in the company of their team of doctors , sports psychologists , physiotherapists , media specialists and even own their own cooks . pre-match boozing , free sweets for the ladies and reticent fans have long been consigned to the history books , along with germany 's early habit of losing too many consecutive matches . after the first game and defeat , germany waited over a year for their first victory , a 1-0 revenge win over the swiss in karlsruhe .
since then , while there have been losses - and thrashings , the largest being a 9-0 reverse against england two weeks before the national team 's first win - germany has built a reputation for well-disciplined success , even when not playing particularly well . germans cut from a different cloth " all germans come from the same factory , presumably the ironworks , " argentina 's world cup-winning coach cesar luis menotti once noted , commenting on the resilience of a long list of legendary players who never gave up and who are responsible in part for building a soccer legacy over the past 100 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz walter , one of the 1954 world cup winners players such as franz beckenbauer , uwe seeler , fritz walter , top scorer gerd mueller and lothar matthaeus , germany 's most-capped star , have come to epitomize the teutonic spirit that was forged in those early forays on the international scene and which eventually brought the national team world cup titles in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 as well as european championship triumphs in 1972 , 1980 and 1996 . as well as success in international tournaments , germany has been involved in some of the most memorable landmark matches in soccer history : a 3-2 triumph over hungary in the 1954 world cup final , the 1966 final they lost 4-2 against england , the heroic battle with italy they lost 4-3 in the 1970 semi-finals . germany also won the first penalty shoot-out at a world cup , against france in the 1982 semis .
fourteen years later germany also won the first major championship final decided by a golden goal , at euro 1996 over the czech republic . dfb celebrates a successful run germany have won 457 of the 800 matches played so far , with 164 draws and 179 defeats .
german teams scored 1,782 goals and conceded 965 .
in addition , an east german national team played 293 matches between 1952 and 1990 - famously beating west germany 1-0 at the 1974 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer 's 1990 world cup-winning team " we 've had quite a successful run , " german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger told the federation 's web site .
" just think about which accomplishments were triggered by soccer in germany , especially following world war ii .
soccer always moved the people living here , whether because of the many major triumphs or defeats .
we have really had an incredible journey . " consistency has always been a part of germany 's century of success .
the national team has only had 10 coaches in its 100 years of international competition , the legendary sepp herberger being the longest-serving .
the coach of the " heroes of bern " - germany 's first world cup winners in 1954 - held the post for 28 years .
his successors held tenures of ever-shortening length ; the last manager to leave office , juergen klinsmann , lasting just two years in another sign of how times have changed . team and federation grows together it has n't been just the national team which has developed into a success over the last 100 years .
the dfb was founded eight years before the national team was created but has enjoyed remarkable success in tandem with it over the past century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer in germany has exploded in the last century " obviously the dfb has grown in the last 100 years , " said thomas hackbarth , director of communications at the dfb .
" it is now one of the biggest sporting associations in europe , employing over 200 people across 21 regional offices and boasting 6.5 million members .
these are people who are or who have been actively involved with german soccer , both in a professional and amateur capacity . " another huge development in the last 100 years is the growth of women 's soccer and the dfb now has over 1 million female members , " hackbarth added .
" this is one of the reasons the 2011 women 's world cup was awarded to germany because the growth in the women 's game here has been phenomenal . " a century of organizational progress aside from the on-field success , germany and the dfb have become synonymous with preparatory perfection in the world of soccer .
as the game has developed over the last 100 years , both the team and the organization behind it have adapted to a changing landscape , culminating in the hugely successful hosting of the 2006 world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " fan mile " was a landmark in world cup evolution " the 2006 world cup was a great success , not just with the national team 's performance , but the whole event , " hackbarth said .
" the dfb proved that it could handle the organization of such a massive event and create an atmosphere of inclusion , humor and safety . " the 2006 world cup was unrecognizable from the first world cup germany participated in 1934 , " he added .
" maybe in the next 100 years , the same thing will be said about 2006 . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but cultivating creativity is one thing - getting buyers to spend is another matter . berlin played a key role in european art throughout the 20th century , spawning generations of avant-garde artists and inspiring many of the revolutionary movements that shaped the art world in the last 100 years .
but although the city was traditionally a magnet for artists in the first half of the 20th century , its 40-year division left it out in the cold until reunification in 1990 , existing wholly outside of the commercial world and completely cut off from international contacts and influences .
in subsequent years , low rents and the heady atmosphere of change made it once again attractive to creative types who helped put it - slowly but surely - back on the art map .
so when it comes to numbers of artists and galleries , the city 's art industry has long been competing with london and new york .
but while there are some 450 galleries in the city - authorities estimate that one new gallery opens each week - there 's relatively little international money being spent here .
mayor klaus wowereit made a virtue of neccessity when he dubbed the city " poor but sexy , " but the reality is that the city would be thrilled if its much-touted arts and culture could also bring home the bacon .
the last decade has seen a clutch of major art fairs do their bit to entice out-of-town investors , including the annual art forum , founded in 1995 , the berlin biennial in 2003 and the annual gallery weekend launched in 2005 .
biennial bonanza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new nationalgalerie is one of the biennial 's venues the 5th berlin biennial for contemporary art , entitled " when things cast no shadow " and curated by adam szymczyk and elena filipovic , started luring the art world 's glitterati to the capital as of friday , april 5 .
the event will comprise two parts , day and night .
during the day , artworks and specially commissioned projects will be on view at three main venues , selected for their cultural significance as well as for their political and economic contexts .
they range from established galleries to al fresco makeshift museums . each venue offers a very different type of exhibition space , with distinctive conditions and frameworks for the artists , artworks , and viewers .
during the night , the exhibition will continue in the form of diverse events held in widely different sites throughout the city every evening .
the lure of the hauptstadt using the city as a complement to the art being showcased is characteristic of the contemporary scene .
" berlin has an urban charm that is n't only about art , " said klaus gerrit friese , president of the german association of german galleries .
" a city that plays host to key events , be they political , social or artistic , will always attract plenty of international artists . "
thomas schulte , another berlin gallery owner , noted in the international herald tribune last month that the german capital has a history of attracting foreign artists that dates back to the 1920s .
" its geographical position stimulates various cultural exchanges between the east and the west , " he said , pointing out that the tradition was brutally interrupted by the rise of nazism , world war ii and the partition of germany .
paying off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work by german artist thomas demand is snapped up by collectors but according to martin mertens , a gallery owner and art historian , berlin 's main appeal is precisely that it has trodden a new unique path that set its apart from the glitzier and more commercial art being peddled on london 's cork street or in new york 's soho .
" most of the international artists have moved to berlin because apartments and studios are still relatively cheap , " he said .
he pays 400 euros -lrb- $ 625 -rrb- a month for his gallery space on the brunnenstrasse , a street on the outskirts of the gentrified mitte neighborhood , currently billed as the hippest art avenue in town - and said he could never dream of such a low rent in london or paris .
friese is confident that the buzz will soon start to pay off .
" we 're hoping to see the emergence of a collectorship on the same scale as in cologne -lsb- the commercial center of the german art scene -rsb- , " he said .
" let 's wait five years , then we 'll see a change in the figures . "
he predicted that it wo n't be long before the cash starts to flow , and said a number of well-heeled collectors are moving to berlin - including christian boros , the hoffmanns , axel haubrock and wilhelm schuermann .

neither party was able to form an alliance with their preferred partners , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens and left party for the spd .
at saturday 's opening session of the new parliament , none of the five parties presented a candidate to challenge koch , allowing him to continue as acting premier .
koch ran a divisive election campaign highlighting crimes committed by foreign youth .
he seized on a violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
his comments sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime he is now expected to try and persuade the greens to join him in a coalition at a later stage .
in his opening speech to parliament , the cdu leader promised an " open door " style of leadership in which all the parties would be regularly informed of the work of his government .
spd in disarray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti 's proposed deal with the left party proved her undoing ypsilanti withdrew her candidacy for the premiership last month after an spd deputy refused to back her plan for a deal with the left party .
the spd leader had sought the support of the left party to tolerate a coalition with the greens .
the greens won 9 seats in the elections , the fdp 11 and the left 6 .
the rise of the left , a far-left grouping which emerged from a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists , has shaken up the german political scene , forcing the main parties to seek arrangements with smaller parties they had previously kept at arm 's length .
in the city-state of hamburg , where the left won parliamentary representation on february 24 , the cdu is negotiating to form a coalition with the greens in what would be the first of its kind in germany .
at federal level , chancellor angela merkel 's cdu heads a " grand coalition " with the spd .
the two parties will face off in elections due in september 2009 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 05.04.2008 berlin art upgrades from sexy to sophisticated großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin biennial has established itself on the city 's packed arts calendar the berlin biennial is designed to consolidate the city 's status as a fertile breeding ground for avant garde art .
but cultivating creativity is one thing - getting buyers to spend is another matter . berlin played a key role in european art throughout the 20th century , spawning generations of avant-garde artists and inspiring many of the revolutionary movements that shaped the art world in the last 100 years .
but although the city was traditionally a magnet for artists in the first half of the 20th century , its 40-year division left it out in the cold until reunification in 1990 , existing wholly outside of the commercial world and completely cut off from international contacts and influences .
in subsequent years , low rents and the heady atmosphere of change made it once again attractive to creative types who helped put it - slowly but surely - back on the art map .
so when it comes to numbers of artists and galleries , the city 's art industry has long been competing with london and new york .
but while there are some 450 galleries in the city - authorities estimate that one new gallery opens each week - there 's relatively little international money being spent here .
mayor klaus wowereit made a virtue of neccessity when he dubbed the city " poor but sexy , " but the reality is that the city would be thrilled if its much-touted arts and culture could also bring home the bacon .
the last decade has seen a clutch of major art fairs do their bit to entice out-of-town investors , including the annual art forum , founded in 1995 , the berlin biennial in 2003 and the annual gallery weekend launched in 2005 .
biennial bonanza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new nationalgalerie is one of the biennial 's venues the 5th berlin biennial for contemporary art , entitled " when things cast no shadow " and curated by adam szymczyk and elena filipovic , started luring the art world 's glitterati to the capital as of friday , april 5 .
the event will comprise two parts , day and night .
during the day , artworks and specially commissioned projects will be on view at three main venues , selected for their cultural significance as well as for their political and economic contexts .
they range from established galleries to al fresco makeshift museums . each venue offers a very different type of exhibition space , with distinctive conditions and frameworks for the artists , artworks , and viewers .
during the night , the exhibition will continue in the form of diverse events held in widely different sites throughout the city every evening .
the lure of the hauptstadt using the city as a complement to the art being showcased is characteristic of the contemporary scene .
" berlin has an urban charm that is n't only about art , " said klaus gerrit friese , president of the german association of german galleries .
" a city that plays host to key events , be they political , social or artistic , will always attract plenty of international artists . "
thomas schulte , another berlin gallery owner , noted in the international herald tribune last month that the german capital has a history of attracting foreign artists that dates back to the 1920s .
" its geographical position stimulates various cultural exchanges between the east and the west , " he said , pointing out that the tradition was brutally interrupted by the rise of nazism , world war ii and the partition of germany .
paying off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work by german artist thomas demand is snapped up by collectors but according to martin mertens , a gallery owner and art historian , berlin 's main appeal is precisely that it has trodden a new unique path that set its apart from the glitzier and more commercial art being peddled on london 's cork street or in new york 's soho .
" most of the international artists have moved to berlin because apartments and studios are still relatively cheap , " he said .
he pays 400 euros -lrb- $ 625 -rrb- a month for his gallery space on the brunnenstrasse , a street on the outskirts of the gentrified mitte neighborhood , currently billed as the hippest art avenue in town - and said he could never dream of such a low rent in london or paris .
friese is confident that the buzz will soon start to pay off .
" we 're hoping to see the emergence of a collectorship on the same scale as in cologne -lsb- the commercial center of the german art scene -rsb- , " he said .
" let 's wait five years , then we 'll see a change in the figures . "
he predicted that it wo n't be long before the cash starts to flow , and said a number of well-heeled collectors are moving to berlin - including christian boros , the hoffmanns , axel haubrock and wilhelm schuermann .
it 's good news for the contemporary art scene - but bound to leave the nay-sayers maintaining that berlin has lost its edge . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

neither party was able to form an alliance with their preferred partners , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens and left party for the spd .
at saturday 's opening session of the new parliament , none of the five parties presented a candidate to challenge koch , allowing him to continue as acting premier .
koch ran a divisive election campaign highlighting crimes committed by foreign youth .
he seized on a violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
his comments sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime he is now expected to try and persuade the greens to join him in a coalition at a later stage .
in his opening speech to parliament , the cdu leader promised an " open door " style of leadership in which all the parties would be regularly informed of the work of his government .
spd in disarray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti 's proposed deal with the left party proved her undoing ypsilanti withdrew her candidacy for the premiership last month after an spd deputy refused to back her plan for a deal with the left party .
the spd leader had sought the support of the left party to tolerate a coalition with the greens .
the greens won 9 seats in the elections , the fdp 11 and the left 6 .
the rise of the left , a far-left grouping which emerged from a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists , has shaken up the german political scene , forcing the main parties to seek arrangements with smaller parties they had previously kept at arm 's length .
in the city-state of hamburg , where the left won parliamentary representation on february 24 , the cdu is negotiating to form a coalition with the greens in what would be the first of its kind in germany .
at federal level , chancellor angela merkel 's cdu heads a " grand coalition " with the spd .
the two parties will face off in elections due in september 2009 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in a letter to fia president max mosley , the adac has distanced itself from events surrounding his person , " adac said . the 67-year-old son of former british fascist party leader oswald mosley , max mosley faces mounting pressure to resign ever since a british newspaper published raunchy details of his personal life . the british sunday newspaper news of the world alleged that mosley was involved in a nazi-style sex orgy with prostitutes in london last friday .
the newspaper posted a video on its web site , showing mosley having sex with five prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adac says mosley 's position has become untenable the adac said the role of an fia president who represents more than 100 million motorists worldwide should not be burdened by such an affair .
therefore , we ask the president to " very carefully reconsider his role within the organization , " the organization said . " it is in the interests of this world organization to carry on with its duties without the burden of this affair . " mosley denies nazi connotation mosley has not denied the incident took place , but insists there were no nazi overtones and he has done no wrong . mosley said he had written to adac , repeating an earlier statement that he would be suing the newspaper that published the story and posted the video on its website . the letter , parts of which were published on autosport.com , has been sent to all members of fia , as well as members of the world council for automobile mobility and tourism . he said that he would have resigned immediately had he been caught speeding or driving over the alcohol limit . " as it is , a scandal paper obtained by illegal means pictures of something i did in private which , although unacceptable to some people , was harmless and completely legal , " mosley said .
" it goes without saying that the so-called nazi element is pure fabrication .
this will become crystal clear when the matter comes to trial .
the newspaper invented this in order to spice up their story and introduce my family background , " he wrote in the letter to adac . " in short , i think i have done nothing wrong and that the wrong was done by the newspaper : " motorsport leading lights urge mosley to quit however , mosley faces a growing chorus of calls from the motorsport world and leading carmakers to step down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the motorsport world want mosley to go bmw , mercedes-benz , honda and toyota have all issued statements distancing themselves from the affair and calling for mosley to act. former racing drivers such as three-time world champion jackie steward and south african world champion jody scheckter have called for mosley to resign . they were joined on friday by the world 's largest auto club , the american automobile association -lrb- aaa -rrb- . " aaa recognizes that mr mosley has dedicated many years of his life to advancing the interests of mobility and motorsport .
however , after careful consideration , aaa has conveyed to mr mosley that it would be in the best interest of all concerned if he were to step down , " aaa public relations managing director yolanda clark was quoted as saying by news reports . clark named the damage done by the revelations about mosley " clearly public . " she said that the fia and its leader " must uphold the highest standards of ethical behavior to exercise the moral authority required to represent millions of motorists .

" in a letter to fia president max mosley , the adac has distanced itself from events surrounding his person , " adac said . the 67-year-old son of former british fascist party leader oswald mosley , max mosley faces mounting pressure to resign ever since a british newspaper published raunchy details of his personal life . the british sunday newspaper news of the world alleged that mosley was involved in a nazi-style sex orgy with prostitutes in london last friday .
the newspaper posted a video on its web site , showing mosley having sex with five prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adac says mosley 's position has become untenable the adac said the role of an fia president who represents more than 100 million motorists worldwide should not be burdened by such an affair .
therefore , we ask the president to " very carefully reconsider his role within the organization , " the organization said . " it is in the interests of this world organization to carry on with its duties without the burden of this affair . " mosley denies nazi connotation mosley has not denied the incident took place , but insists there were no nazi overtones and he has done no wrong . mosley said he had written to adac , repeating an earlier statement that he would be suing the newspaper that published the story and posted the video on its website . the letter , parts of which were published on autosport.com , has been sent to all members of fia , as well as members of the world council for automobile mobility and tourism . he said that he would have resigned immediately had he been caught speeding or driving over the alcohol limit . " as it is , a scandal paper obtained by illegal means pictures of something i did in private which , although unacceptable to some people , was harmless and completely legal , " mosley said .
" it goes without saying that the so-called nazi element is pure fabrication .
this will become crystal clear when the matter comes to trial .
the newspaper invented this in order to spice up their story and introduce my family background , " he wrote in the letter to adac . " in short , i think i have done nothing wrong and that the wrong was done by the newspaper : " motorsport leading lights urge mosley to quit however , mosley faces a growing chorus of calls from the motorsport world and leading carmakers to step down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the motorsport world want mosley to go bmw , mercedes-benz , honda and toyota have all issued statements distancing themselves from the affair and calling for mosley to act. former racing drivers such as three-time world champion jackie steward and south african world champion jody scheckter have called for mosley to resign . they were joined on friday by the world 's largest auto club , the american automobile association -lrb- aaa -rrb- . " aaa recognizes that mr mosley has dedicated many years of his life to advancing the interests of mobility and motorsport .
however , after careful consideration , aaa has conveyed to mr mosley that it would be in the best interest of all concerned if he were to step down , " aaa public relations managing director yolanda clark was quoted as saying by news reports . clark named the damage done by the revelations about mosley " clearly public . " she said that the fia and its leader " must uphold the highest standards of ethical behavior to exercise the moral authority required to represent millions of motorists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 05.04.2008 berlin art upgrades from sexy to sophisticated großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin biennial has established itself on the city 's packed arts calendar the berlin biennial is designed to consolidate the city 's status as a fertile breeding ground for avant garde art .
but cultivating creativity is one thing - getting buyers to spend is another matter . berlin played a key role in european art throughout the 20th century , spawning generations of avant-garde artists and inspiring many of the revolutionary movements that shaped the art world in the last 100 years .
but although the city was traditionally a magnet for artists in the first half of the 20th century , its 40-year division left it out in the cold until reunification in 1990 , existing wholly outside of the commercial world and completely cut off from international contacts and influences .
in subsequent years , low rents and the heady atmosphere of change made it once again attractive to creative types who helped put it - slowly but surely - back on the art map .
so when it comes to numbers of artists and galleries , the city 's art industry has long been competing with london and new york .
but while there are some 450 galleries in the city - authorities estimate that one new gallery opens each week - there 's relatively little international money being spent here .
mayor klaus wowereit made a virtue of neccessity when he dubbed the city " poor but sexy , " but the reality is that the city would be thrilled if its much-touted arts and culture could also bring home the bacon .
the last decade has seen a clutch of major art fairs do their bit to entice out-of-town investors , including the annual art forum , founded in 1995 , the berlin biennial in 2003 and the annual gallery weekend launched in 2005 .
biennial bonanza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new nationalgalerie is one of the biennial 's venues the 5th berlin biennial for contemporary art , entitled " when things cast no shadow " and curated by adam szymczyk and elena filipovic , started luring the art world 's glitterati to the capital as of friday , april 5 .
the event will comprise two parts , day and night .
during the day , artworks and specially commissioned projects will be on view at three main venues , selected for their cultural significance as well as for their political and economic contexts .
they range from established galleries to al fresco makeshift museums . each venue offers a very different type of exhibition space , with distinctive conditions and frameworks for the artists , artworks , and viewers .
during the night , the exhibition will continue in the form of diverse events held in widely different sites throughout the city every evening .
the lure of the hauptstadt using the city as a complement to the art being showcased is characteristic of the contemporary scene .
" berlin has an urban charm that is n't only about art , " said klaus gerrit friese , president of the german association of german galleries .
" a city that plays host to key events , be they political , social or artistic , will always attract plenty of international artists . "
thomas schulte , another berlin gallery owner , noted in the international herald tribune last month that the german capital has a history of attracting foreign artists that dates back to the 1920s .
" its geographical position stimulates various cultural exchanges between the east and the west , " he said , pointing out that the tradition was brutally interrupted by the rise of nazism , world war ii and the partition of germany .
paying off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work by german artist thomas demand is snapped up by collectors but according to martin mertens , a gallery owner and art historian , berlin 's main appeal is precisely that it has trodden a new unique path that set its apart from the glitzier and more commercial art being peddled on london 's cork street or in new york 's soho .
" most of the international artists have moved to berlin because apartments and studios are still relatively cheap , " he said .
he pays 400 euros -lrb- $ 625 -rrb- a month for his gallery space on the brunnenstrasse , a street on the outskirts of the gentrified mitte neighborhood , currently billed as the hippest art avenue in town - and said he could never dream of such a low rent in london or paris .
friese is confident that the buzz will soon start to pay off .
" we 're hoping to see the emergence of a collectorship on the same scale as in cologne -lsb- the commercial center of the german art scene -rsb- , " he said .
" let 's wait five years , then we 'll see a change in the figures . "
he predicted that it wo n't be long before the cash starts to flow , and said a number of well-heeled collectors are moving to berlin - including christian boros , the hoffmanns , axel haubrock and wilhelm schuermann .
it 's good news for the contemporary art scene - but bound to leave the nay-sayers maintaining that berlin has lost its edge . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
