the harsh penalty has drawn hefty criticism , particularly from washington . florian norbu gyanatshang , a 30-year-old tibetan-german from stuttgart , was among those being held in beijing .
head of the german chapter of the tibetan youth association in europe , the software developer was arrested on thursday , aug .
21 , for unfurling a tibetan flag near the olympic stadium in the chinese capital . " as a german citizen , i can not remain silent at the blatant human rights violations that are occurring in tibet , " he said in a statement published in germany after his arrest .
" and as a tibetan , i would like to stand by my fellow countrymen in this difficult situation . " two americans and one briton were arrested with gyanatshang for disturbing the " public order . "
chinese police said on friday that they had detained another six us activists for 10 days . ten-day detention is the harshest treatment so far of tibet activists since a series of demonstrations in the capital during the olympics .
chinese law allows police to force people to undergo administrative detention without trial .
dozens of other protesters have been deported shortly after their arrest during the games . us urges human rights standards the six americans most recently detained were believed to be from the us-based group students for a free tibet , which had held eight pro-tibet protests in beijing since aug .
6 . " these people of conscience from many walks of life were here to make sure the tibetan issue was at the forefront during these olympics games , " kate woznow , the group 's campaign director , told dpa news agency . a spokeswoman for the us embassy in beijing told dpa that the embassy was aware of the detainments , but she could not provide details due to privacy concerns . " we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights , including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond , " said spokeswoman susan stevenson . " these rights are protected by china 's own constitution and international human rights standards to which china has agreed . " when asked about the detentions and other human rights issues , chinese olympic organizing committee vice-president wang wie said western media were showing a bias against china and lack of knowledge about the country at a press conference on friday . " history will show that awarding the games to china was the correct decision , " he told reporters , adding that they should " write the truth .

but demonizing russia wo n't help , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the georgian conflict significantly worsened the relationship between the nato countries of the west and russia .
signs of escalation on both sides are unmistakable . the nato-russia council will be suspended by the west until russian troops have pulled out from georgia proper .
as a countermove , russia is calling back its nato representatives and canceling all planned maneuvers with nato for 2008 . and that 's not all .
an agreement regarding a georgia resolution has not been achieved by the un security council , and in warsaw , americans and poles are signing an agreement to station a missile shield - a move that the russians perceive as a threat . a foreign policy rival the deterioration of the west 's relationship with russia is accompanied by heated social discussions in which poland and eastern central europe in particular are painting russia as an aggressive imperialistic power - as if the kremlin were on the verge of attacking the former soviet union or the warsaw pact states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel indeed , there is no doubt that the invasion of georgia proper by russian troops , as well as the air strikes on georgian targets outside of south ossetia , were excessive .
russia went too far .
and the us and eu states are rightfully asking that russia 's unacceptable overreaction now be corrected .
nevertheless , it is wrong to answer russia with an equally irrational reaction . it 's always been known that russia is and will remain a difficult partner .
russia already took over the job of protector state over abkhazia and south ossetia years ago .
saakashvili 's attempt to reconquer the separatist south ossetian region with military force was a dangerous undertaking from the outset and one that was destined to end in a political and humanitarian disaster . it borders on political naivite to believe that russia would act differently than it did . an uncomfortable partner now a clear realpolitik is needed with russia , without yielding to moscow in georgia .
georgia 's independence and territorial integrity must be protected .
europe 's interest in peace and stability requires it . at the same time , it does n't help to demonize russia now and practice a consequent policy of containment and orbit , because having a good relationship with russia is in our own interests when it comes to other issues . these include energy supply , iran 's nuclear program , the reconstruction of afghanistan , the middle east and the north korea conflict . the caucasus conflict should not be made into the lynchpin for the definition of the west 's relationship with russia .
consideration of russian interests in the caucasus conflict does n't have to mean submission to russian policy , but rather is an intelligent approach that is in europe 's best interest . and when it comes down to it , harsh realpolitik is the only thing russian politics understands . ingo mannteufel is the head of dw 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the next us president will have to repair ties with russia . in a rare show of solidarity with the republican incumbent , democratic presidential hopeful obama said on thursday , aug .
21 , that he agreed with president george w. bush 's stance toward russia following the recent five-day conflict with georgia . " i 'm supportive of what george bush has been doing , " said obama , who disagrees with bush on most foreign policy issues .
" there will be a time later for politics .
i 'm a big believer that when you 're in a crisis , america speaks with one voice . " bush , who has nurtured positive personal relations with russian prime minister vladimir putin over the past eight years , has firmly denounced russia 's decision to send troops into georgia after the former soviet republic attacked the separatist region of south ossetia on aug .
8 . while the west has largely condemned russia 's military involvement in georgia , russia has sharply criticized georgia for attacking its breakaway provinces . new chapter in us-russia relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama agrees with bush - at least as far as the caucasus war is concerned the us president has insisted that georgia 's territorial sovereignty be respected .
the pro-russian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia have enjoyed de facto independence from georgia since the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 . nevertheless , the clash with russia has put the chill on us-russian relations . the conflict in the caucasus " indicates a new stage in the relationship between russia and the west , " said obama thursday .
" we 've got to be firm with the russians , in alliance with our european allies , that this kind of behavior is intolerable . " both obama and republican presidential hopeful john mccain have warned russia of severe , long-term consequences from its conflict with georgia . the united states is caught somewhat between a rock and a hard place as it is dependent on russia 's approval in the united nations security council , where moscow enjoys veto power , on a number of international issues . georgia becomes presidential battlefield mccain , who is slightly behind obama in polls , has used the russian-georgian conflict to draw attention to his extensive foreign policy experience .
a vietnam veteran , former prisoner of war , and long-time us senator , mccain has said he is better suited than his significantly younger opponent to take on the position of commander-in-chief . obama , a first-term senator from illinois with no military experience , recently made a highly publicized tour of europe in an effort to boost his image on the foreign policy front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain , seen here with us troops in iraq , said his military experience better qualifies him mccain has gone beyond the white house 's stance in his response to russia in light of the fighting in georgia , demanding that russia be expelled from the group of eight highly industrialized nations , at least for a time .
he has also expressed opposition to russian membership in the world trade organization . " in matters of national security , good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president - as we were all reminded ... by the events in the nation of georgia , " said mccain earlier this week . advice from all sides obama promised thursday , addressing supporters in virginia , to call on the " best and brightest " foreign policy advisors , should he be elected . " and by the way , they do n't have to be democrats , " he said , naming republican richard lugar , who is chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , among others . as far as foreign policy matters are concerned , mccain and obama differ most notably in their approach to the war in iraq , which is largely unpopular in europe . obama has pledged to withdraw nearly all us troops from iraq within 16 months , while mccain has promised to remain until victory . addressing us foreign policy as a whole on thursday , obama conceded , however , that " there are times when we are going to have to use military force .

22 but were still operating checkpoints despite pledges to leave by the end of the day .
columns were reportedly headed for south ossetia and abkhazia . as the united nations again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict , russia finally began to withdraw , in line with a french-brokered plan , from the strongly pro-western ex-soviet republic .
the russian general staff said that troops were " in the final stage of pulling back , " but they would continue to hold buffer zones and maintain peacekeeping forces in the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .
the united states has criticized the planned buffer zone as a half-way measure that fails to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
russian armored columns were moving north from the central gori sector in south ossetia , but a defensive cordon remained in place with checkpoints outside gori and near the georgian village of igoeti .
troops heading for south ossetia and abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west and georgia say russia is dragging its heels twenty russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops were seen heading north from near the georgian city of gori toward the separatist region of south ossetia , reporters said .
the nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armored personnel carriers headed towards the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian troopers driving northward on the gori-tskhinvali road shouted " russia ! " and " we 're going home ! "
but reconnaissance , tank , and infantry peacekeepers operating checkpoints in the vicinity said they had not received orders to evacuate .
russian infantry were continuing to dig in on high ground overlooking a river bridge near igoeti .
fuel tankers were refueling tanks and armored personnel carriers , and supply lorries were delivering food and water to russian troops .
the russian military said 18 additional russian checkpoints were being set up as part of russian-controlled buffer zones along the borders between central georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia respectively .
a contingent of 2,142 russian peacekeeping forces would remain in abkhazia and 452 troops in south ossetia , colonel general nogovitsyn said .
russian forces would be out of georgia proper by 20:00 local time , he said .
criticism continues over delay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columns of troops are heading for the rebel regions aleksander lomia , georgia 's national security council head , in mid-afternoon gave tbilisi 's first official acknowledgement of the russian withdrawal , saying russian forces " were pulling out , but not fast enough , " according to an interfax report .
international criticism has mounted that moscow is delaying withdrawing its troops from georgian territory in accordance with a ceasefire that ended the 10-day conflict .
us president george w bush called for an end to the russian " siege " in a telephone conversation on thursday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , a us ally .
but russian military commanders brushed aside bush 's demands , saying they were complying with the peace accord .
" the president of the united states is on vacation .
obviously , he is not receiving timely information .
we recommend the president 's press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences , " nogovitsyn said .
russians manning checkpoints along the tbilisi-gori road were permitting civilian and humanitarian traffic to pass , but were blocking " unscheduled " diplomats and media .
a russian national flag flew over the gori checkpoint .
georgia 's western region also saw substantial russian withdrawals on friday , with amour and infantry abandoning georgian government buildings in the centre of zugdidi , a town near the border with abkhazia , the georgian secessionist province loyal to moscow .
the western town of senaki , site of georgia 's largest air base , and the port of poti , on the black sea coast , had seen no reductions in russian occupation forces by early afternoon on friday .
russian forces rolled into georgia on august 8 to push back a georgian offensive to re-take control of its rebel south ossetia region , which won de facto autonomy in a civil war in the early 1990s .
russian troops also moved forward in georgia 's other breakaway region of abkhazia , and seized key strategic bases in georgia , including poti .

" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .
the united states has criticized the planned buffer zone as a half-way measure that fails to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
russian armored columns were moving north from the central gori sector in south ossetia , but a defensive cordon remained in place with checkpoints outside gori and near the georgian village of igoeti .
troops heading for south ossetia and abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west and georgia say russia is dragging its heels twenty russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops were seen heading north from near the georgian city of gori toward the separatist region of south ossetia , reporters said .
the nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armored personnel carriers headed towards the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian troopers driving northward on the gori-tskhinvali road shouted " russia ! " and " we 're going home ! "
but reconnaissance , tank , and infantry peacekeepers operating checkpoints in the vicinity said they had not received orders to evacuate .
russian infantry were continuing to dig in on high ground overlooking a river bridge near igoeti .
fuel tankers were refueling tanks and armored personnel carriers , and supply lorries were delivering food and water to russian troops .
the russian military said 18 additional russian checkpoints were being set up as part of russian-controlled buffer zones along the borders between central georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia respectively .
a contingent of 2,142 russian peacekeeping forces would remain in abkhazia and 452 troops in south ossetia , colonel general nogovitsyn said .
russian forces would be out of georgia proper by 20:00 local time , he said .
criticism continues over delay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columns of troops are heading for the rebel regions aleksander lomia , georgia 's national security council head , in mid-afternoon gave tbilisi 's first official acknowledgement of the russian withdrawal , saying russian forces " were pulling out , but not fast enough , " according to an interfax report .
international criticism has mounted that moscow is delaying withdrawing its troops from georgian territory in accordance with a ceasefire that ended the 10-day conflict .
us president george w bush called for an end to the russian " siege " in a telephone conversation on thursday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , a us ally .
but russian military commanders brushed aside bush 's demands , saying they were complying with the peace accord .
" the president of the united states is on vacation .
obviously , he is not receiving timely information .
we recommend the president 's press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences , " nogovitsyn said .
russians manning checkpoints along the tbilisi-gori road were permitting civilian and humanitarian traffic to pass , but were blocking " unscheduled " diplomats and media .
a russian national flag flew over the gori checkpoint .
georgia 's western region also saw substantial russian withdrawals on friday , with amour and infantry abandoning georgian government buildings in the centre of zugdidi , a town near the border with abkhazia , the georgian secessionist province loyal to moscow .
the western town of senaki , site of georgia 's largest air base , and the port of poti , on the black sea coast , had seen no reductions in russian occupation forces by early afternoon on friday .
russian forces rolled into georgia on august 8 to push back a georgian offensive to re-take control of its rebel south ossetia region , which won de facto autonomy in a civil war in the early 1990s .
russian troops also moved forward in georgia 's other breakaway region of abkhazia , and seized key strategic bases in georgia , including poti .

on thursday , tens of thousands gathered in sukhumi , capital of abkhazia , to demand russian recognition of their independence .
over 1,000 people attended a similar rally in south ossetia 's main town and on friday , the south ossetia parliament formally asked russia to recognize its independence , ria novosti news agency reported .
moscow has hinted at giving both recognition in a move that would risk sparking one of the deepest crises between russia and the west since the cold war .

and though they 're too young to remember the cold war , they still feel the old grievances . mariam sits in the main garden outside the university in bonn , germany .
it 's a warm august evening and the sun has just set .
mariam does n't notice .
she is too caught up in the thoughts running through her mind .
mariam , a university student , says she is afraid every day .
afraid for her family and her country . " each day i call my mother in tbilisi and if she does n't answer i am totally overcome by fear .
i 'm convinced that a russian bomb landed on our house , " she says . rage towards russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariam fears for her family 's safety for the past four years mariam has lived in germany , studying economics .
she would like to return to her homeland , but at the moment she does n't dare .
she and her georgian friends follow the unrest in her native country on the television and the internet . mariam and her sister , mtvarisa , are furious with russia and the russian president .
mtvarisa says that russia just can not deal with the fact that georgia is developing in a western fashion . georgia has a very strategic position .
gas and oil pipelines pass through our country , and of course the russians want to control them , she adds . " we have to defend ourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers are out in full force against the russians nino also firmly believes in her country and the georgian president .
she finds saakashvili 's actions commendable .
" we have to defend ourselves , " she says .
it sounds like something memorized at a young age .
nino has been in germany for a year , and is waiting for a spot to open up for her to study medicine . she has just turned 20 .
she never experienced the cold war .
nevertheless , even she feels some of the old hatred when she sees the former frontlines re-outlined : east against west , russia against america - and georgia in the middle , sitting on the fence .
georgia is like a buffer state with an overpowering adversary standing at the door . enemies at the disco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nino completely supports her government for the young georgians , a russian is someone to hate , not to have as a friend .
that 's how it 's always been .
because of that , nino could never imagine herself falling in love with a russian boy , not even here in germany . " after everything that has happened between our countries , it is n't possible anymore , " she says defensively , shaking her head . the young georgian has brought this hate , anger and fear with her to germany .
luckily there are n't any russians living in her dormitory , she says .
though she came across a few in the street one evening recently .
a couple of russian students who were looking for a disco asked nino and mariam if they knew where one was . mariam recognized the accent immediately .
when she and nino told the russians where they were from , the mood darkened , she explains . " and when they asked where we were from , and we told them that we 're georgians , they became aggressive .
one boy screamed : ' russia will kill georgia ' .
i said , you are our enemies , but we will gladly help you find a disco , " she says . " there is no peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian soldiers have still not withdrawn from the country the only solution is for the russians to leave , agree the two students .
they are afraid that russia will simply annex georgia and remove the government . " i could never live under a russian government , " says mariam .
" i am georgian and proud of it . " " there is no peace , " says nino , " the war is over , but the people are still afraid of the russians .
they are still in georgia and refuse to leave .
they ’ re aiming their rockets at tbilisi . " " m-schwi-do-ba " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtvarisa , nino , tamta und mariam occasionally the students have doubts about their hatred for russia , though it 's rare .
sometimes they meet russians who are actually very nice .
like the woman at the language course at the community college .
mariam quickly became friends with this potential enemy .
it didn ’ t last .
" the politics destroyed our friendship , " she says , sadly . because despite all the anger , the georgian students only want one thing : " m-shvi-do-ba , " they say .
it 's georgian , and it means peace . anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three-quarters of the substances greenpeace found are considered harmful to both personal health and the environment .

troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .
however , in the interview with german public broadcaster ard on friday , he added that moscow 's use of force in georgia was " fully disproportionate " to the severity of the situation . buffer zone a point of contention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian president has rejected the idea of a buffer zone russian president dmitry medvedev has promised that all but 500 russian troops would be withdrawn from georgia by then . moscow said those remaining troops would be stationed in what it termed as " zone of responsibility " as part of a peacekeeping operation to protect south ossetia .
this would leave russian troops present inside the georgian heartland and close to its economically vital east-west highway .
boldryev made no reference those 500 troops in his remarks . georgian president mikhail saakashvili has said he would not stand for their presence . " there will be no buffer zones , " he told reuters news agency in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
" we will never live with any buffer zones .
we 'll never allow anything like this . " osce observers due monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee camp for georgians from south ossetia and gori meanwhile , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has announced that twenty of its observers will be ready to start monitoring a ceasefire between georgia and russia from monday . " by monday most of the equipment will be in place - especially the armored vehicles - we will have our staff here , we will have our operational center set up and we can start sending out monitors into various parts in georgia and neighboring south ossetia , " said alexander stubb , the pan-european security organization 's chairman . his comments came while visiting a refugee camp on the outskirts of tbilisi .
he had earlier traveled through russian-controlled checkpoints to the city of gori where russian troops were still present , deep inside georgia . stubb , who is also the finnish foreign minister , said he had witnessed " atrocious sights . " " there are russian interior ministry special forces bringing old people from villages , basically emptying the villages on the south ossetian side and dumping them in gori , " he told reuters . no agreement at security council russia late thursday submitted a formal text to the un security council aimed at ending the conflict in georgia , but the united states and britain said they were not ready to vote for it . the 15-nation council also had a second draft resolution for consideration from france , the current president of the european union , which called for the immediate and definite withdrawal of russian troops from georgia , including south ossetia and abkhazia , a cease-fire and international negotiations to settle the issues between georgia and russia . british ambassador john sawers told reporters following a two-hour closed-door discussion by the council that the body was not ready to adopt either the russian or the french draft because of the unsettled conditions on the ground in georgia . " we do need to see real progress on the ground , " sawers said referring to demands for russia to pull out of georgia . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his widow , helga , said that vogel had not been well after suffering a heart attack earlier in this year . the former lawyer was best known for his work as a german to german negotiator .
while working for the government of east germany , he made the transfer of over 250,000 people out of the gdr possible .
vogel also arranged the exchange of almost 34,000 political prisoners between the east and west . during the height of the cold war in the late 50s , vogel was the only point man between the west german government in bonn and the communist gdr in east berlin .
at the time both sides claimed to have no official contact . negotiating for super powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vogel oversaw the exchange of kgb spy abel and american pilot powers vogel gained a sense of acclaim , if not notoriety , for overseeing the exchange of kgb spy rudolf j. abel for gary powers in 1962 .
powers was an american pilot shot down over the ussr while flying his u-2 spy plane in 1960 . he also oversaw the exchange of others involved in espionage or imprisoned in east germany in exchange for those held in the west , including jewish dissident anatoly scharansky , who spent nearly nine years in soviet captivity on espionage charges .

ironically , at the time , the span was known as the ‘ bridge of unity ’ , even though it only served the allies as a border crossing .
vogel 's reach inside the east german government was so extensive that when former chancellor helmut schmidt wanted to visit the country , it was vogel who helped arrange it .
schmidt later dubbed vogel “ our mail man ” .
after the fall of the berlin wall , vogel admitted that he also worked for the stasi , east germany ’ s secret police .
he was accused of blackmailing people who wanted to leave the gdr , and for selling real estate at well below market value .
however , in 1998 he was cleared of those charges by the german federal supreme court . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pro-russian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia have enjoyed de facto independence from georgia since the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 . nevertheless , the clash with russia has put the chill on us-russian relations . the conflict in the caucasus " indicates a new stage in the relationship between russia and the west , " said obama thursday .
" we 've got to be firm with the russians , in alliance with our european allies , that this kind of behavior is intolerable . " both obama and republican presidential hopeful john mccain have warned russia of severe , long-term consequences from its conflict with georgia . the united states is caught somewhat between a rock and a hard place as it is dependent on russia 's approval in the united nations security council , where moscow enjoys veto power , on a number of international issues . georgia becomes presidential battlefield mccain , who is slightly behind obama in polls , has used the russian-georgian conflict to draw attention to his extensive foreign policy experience .
a vietnam veteran , former prisoner of war , and long-time us senator , mccain has said he is better suited than his significantly younger opponent to take on the position of commander-in-chief . obama , a first-term senator from illinois with no military experience , recently made a highly publicized tour of europe in an effort to boost his image on the foreign policy front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain , seen here with us troops in iraq , said his military experience better qualifies him mccain has gone beyond the white house 's stance in his response to russia in light of the fighting in georgia , demanding that russia be expelled from the group of eight highly industrialized nations , at least for a time .
he has also expressed opposition to russian membership in the world trade organization . " in matters of national security , good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president - as we were all reminded ... by the events in the nation of georgia , " said mccain earlier this week . advice from all sides obama promised thursday , addressing supporters in virginia , to call on the " best and brightest " foreign policy advisors , should he be elected . " and by the way , they do n't have to be democrats , " he said , naming republican richard lugar , who is chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , among others . as far as foreign policy matters are concerned , mccain and obama differ most notably in their approach to the war in iraq , which is largely unpopular in europe . obama has pledged to withdraw nearly all us troops from iraq within 16 months , while mccain has promised to remain until victory . addressing us foreign policy as a whole on thursday , obama conceded , however , that " there are times when we are going to have to use military force .

" these rights are protected by china 's own constitution and international human rights standards to which china has agreed . " when asked about the detentions and other human rights issues , chinese olympic organizing committee vice-president wang wie said western media were showing a bias against china and lack of knowledge about the country at a press conference on friday .

but the next us president will have to repair ties with russia . in a rare show of solidarity with the republican incumbent , democratic presidential hopeful obama said on thursday , aug .
21 , that he agreed with president george w. bush 's stance toward russia following the recent five-day conflict with georgia . " i 'm supportive of what george bush has been doing , " said obama , who disagrees with bush on most foreign policy issues .
" there will be a time later for politics .
i 'm a big believer that when you 're in a crisis , america speaks with one voice . " bush , who has nurtured positive personal relations with russian prime minister vladimir putin over the past eight years , has firmly denounced russia 's decision to send troops into georgia after the former soviet republic attacked the separatist region of south ossetia on aug .
8 . while the west has largely condemned russia 's military involvement in georgia , russia has sharply criticized georgia for attacking its breakaway provinces . new chapter in us-russia relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama agrees with bush - at least as far as the caucasus war is concerned the us president has insisted that georgia 's territorial sovereignty be respected .
the pro-russian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia have enjoyed de facto independence from georgia since the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 . nevertheless , the clash with russia has put the chill on us-russian relations . the conflict in the caucasus " indicates a new stage in the relationship between russia and the west , " said obama thursday .
" we 've got to be firm with the russians , in alliance with our european allies , that this kind of behavior is intolerable . " both obama and republican presidential hopeful john mccain have warned russia of severe , long-term consequences from its conflict with georgia . the united states is caught somewhat between a rock and a hard place as it is dependent on russia 's approval in the united nations security council , where moscow enjoys veto power , on a number of international issues . georgia becomes presidential battlefield mccain , who is slightly behind obama in polls , has used the russian-georgian conflict to draw attention to his extensive foreign policy experience .
a vietnam veteran , former prisoner of war , and long-time us senator , mccain has said he is better suited than his significantly younger opponent to take on the position of commander-in-chief . obama , a first-term senator from illinois with no military experience , recently made a highly publicized tour of europe in an effort to boost his image on the foreign policy front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain , seen here with us troops in iraq , said his military experience better qualifies him mccain has gone beyond the white house 's stance in his response to russia in light of the fighting in georgia , demanding that russia be expelled from the group of eight highly industrialized nations , at least for a time .
he has also expressed opposition to russian membership in the world trade organization . " in matters of national security , good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president - as we were all reminded ... by the events in the nation of georgia , " said mccain earlier this week . advice from all sides obama promised thursday , addressing supporters in virginia , to call on the " best and brightest " foreign policy advisors , should he be elected . " and by the way , they do n't have to be democrats , " he said , naming republican richard lugar , who is chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , among others . as far as foreign policy matters are concerned , mccain and obama differ most notably in their approach to the war in iraq , which is largely unpopular in europe . obama has pledged to withdraw nearly all us troops from iraq within 16 months , while mccain has promised to remain until victory . addressing us foreign policy as a whole on thursday , obama conceded , however , that " there are times when we are going to have to use military force .

vogel 's reach inside the east german government was so extensive that when former chancellor helmut schmidt wanted to visit the country , it was vogel who helped arrange it .

but the next us president will have to repair ties with russia . in a rare show of solidarity with the republican incumbent , democratic presidential hopeful obama said on thursday , aug .
21 , that he agreed with president george w. bush 's stance toward russia following the recent five-day conflict with georgia . " i 'm supportive of what george bush has been doing , " said obama , who disagrees with bush on most foreign policy issues .
" there will be a time later for politics .
i 'm a big believer that when you 're in a crisis , america speaks with one voice . " bush , who has nurtured positive personal relations with russian prime minister vladimir putin over the past eight years , has firmly denounced russia 's decision to send troops into georgia after the former soviet republic attacked the separatist region of south ossetia on aug .
8 . while the west has largely condemned russia 's military involvement in georgia , russia has sharply criticized georgia for attacking its breakaway provinces . new chapter in us-russia relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama agrees with bush - at least as far as the caucasus war is concerned the us president has insisted that georgia 's territorial sovereignty be respected .
the pro-russian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia have enjoyed de facto independence from georgia since the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 . nevertheless , the clash with russia has put the chill on us-russian relations . the conflict in the caucasus " indicates a new stage in the relationship between russia and the west , " said obama thursday .
" we 've got to be firm with the russians , in alliance with our european allies , that this kind of behavior is intolerable . " both obama and republican presidential hopeful john mccain have warned russia of severe , long-term consequences from its conflict with georgia . the united states is caught somewhat between a rock and a hard place as it is dependent on russia 's approval in the united nations security council , where moscow enjoys veto power , on a number of international issues . georgia becomes presidential battlefield mccain , who is slightly behind obama in polls , has used the russian-georgian conflict to draw attention to his extensive foreign policy experience .
a vietnam veteran , former prisoner of war , and long-time us senator , mccain has said he is better suited than his significantly younger opponent to take on the position of commander-in-chief . obama , a first-term senator from illinois with no military experience , recently made a highly publicized tour of europe in an effort to boost his image on the foreign policy front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain , seen here with us troops in iraq , said his military experience better qualifies him mccain has gone beyond the white house 's stance in his response to russia in light of the fighting in georgia , demanding that russia be expelled from the group of eight highly industrialized nations , at least for a time .
he has also expressed opposition to russian membership in the world trade organization . " in matters of national security , good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president - as we were all reminded ... by the events in the nation of georgia , " said mccain earlier this week . advice from all sides obama promised thursday , addressing supporters in virginia , to call on the " best and brightest " foreign policy advisors , should he be elected . " and by the way , they do n't have to be democrats , " he said , naming republican richard lugar , who is chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , among others . as far as foreign policy matters are concerned , mccain and obama differ most notably in their approach to the war in iraq , which is largely unpopular in europe . obama has pledged to withdraw nearly all us troops from iraq within 16 months , while mccain has promised to remain until victory . addressing us foreign policy as a whole on thursday , obama conceded , however , that " there are times when we are going to have to use military force .

but the next us president will have to repair ties with russia . in a rare show of solidarity with the republican incumbent , democratic presidential hopeful obama said on thursday , aug .
21 , that he agreed with president george w. bush 's stance toward russia following the recent five-day conflict with georgia . " i 'm supportive of what george bush has been doing , " said obama , who disagrees with bush on most foreign policy issues .
" there will be a time later for politics .
i 'm a big believer that when you 're in a crisis , america speaks with one voice . " bush , who has nurtured positive personal relations with russian prime minister vladimir putin over the past eight years , has firmly denounced russia 's decision to send troops into georgia after the former soviet republic attacked the separatist region of south ossetia on aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 22.08.2008 russia : 10 days needed for georgia pullout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians are now said to be pulling out of gori russia promised to withdraw most forces from deep inside georgia , but was set to retain a military presence in two separatist regions and a buffer zone .
troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .
however , in the interview with german public broadcaster ard on friday , he added that moscow 's use of force in georgia was " fully disproportionate " to the severity of the situation . buffer zone a point of contention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian president has rejected the idea of a buffer zone russian president dmitry medvedev has promised that all but 500 russian troops would be withdrawn from georgia by then . moscow said those remaining troops would be stationed in what it termed as " zone of responsibility " as part of a peacekeeping operation to protect south ossetia .
this would leave russian troops present inside the georgian heartland and close to its economically vital east-west highway .
boldryev made no reference those 500 troops in his remarks . georgian president mikhail saakashvili has said he would not stand for their presence . " there will be no buffer zones , " he told reuters news agency in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
" we will never live with any buffer zones .
we 'll never allow anything like this . " osce observers due monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee camp for georgians from south ossetia and gori meanwhile , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has announced that twenty of its observers will be ready to start monitoring a ceasefire between georgia and russia from monday . " by monday most of the equipment will be in place - especially the armored vehicles - we will have our staff here , we will have our operational center set up and we can start sending out monitors into various parts in georgia and neighboring south ossetia , " said alexander stubb , the pan-european security organization 's chairman . his comments came while visiting a refugee camp on the outskirts of tbilisi .

troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .
however , in the interview with german public broadcaster ard on friday , he added that moscow 's use of force in georgia was " fully disproportionate " to the severity of the situation . buffer zone a point of contention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian president has rejected the idea of a buffer zone russian president dmitry medvedev has promised that all but 500 russian troops would be withdrawn from georgia by then . moscow said those remaining troops would be stationed in what it termed as " zone of responsibility " as part of a peacekeeping operation to protect south ossetia .
this would leave russian troops present inside the georgian heartland and close to its economically vital east-west highway .
boldryev made no reference those 500 troops in his remarks . georgian president mikhail saakashvili has said he would not stand for their presence . " there will be no buffer zones , " he told reuters news agency in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
" we will never live with any buffer zones .
we 'll never allow anything like this . " osce observers due monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee camp for georgians from south ossetia and gori meanwhile , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has announced that twenty of its observers will be ready to start monitoring a ceasefire between georgia and russia from monday . " by monday most of the equipment will be in place - especially the armored vehicles - we will have our staff here , we will have our operational center set up and we can start sending out monitors into various parts in georgia and neighboring south ossetia , " said alexander stubb , the pan-european security organization 's chairman . his comments came while visiting a refugee camp on the outskirts of tbilisi .

dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years . the year was 1977 shortly after the death of mao , and i had gotten a special visa reserved for young “ overseas chinese ” to visit the motherland .
back then china was an impoverished police state that had just emerged from the political chaos and violence of the cultural revolution , a misnomer for a movement that destroyed any shred of culture whatsoever .
i could n't even utter the name mao in public except to glorify him , let alone criticize the chinese government .
my visa was restricted to the one city where some cousins still lived - shanghai , which many chinese call the berlin of the east for its dazzle , sophistication , progressive politics and historical baggage . striking uniformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's portrait remains , but his ideology is gone i could n't walk down the streets wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt without being interrogated by the neighborhood watchdogs about my western apparel .
everyone wore shapeless uniform jackets and baggy trousers in faded green , blue or grey . there was hardly a single western face on the streets in this most cosmopolitan of all chinese cities .
if a fair-haired , blue-eyed foreigner appeared in public , he was swarmed by a crowd of onlookers .
there were few businessmen and diplomats , no tourists and no accredited journalists in china .
physical movement was restricted by lack of transport .
there were a few city trams , no cars or subways and if anyone tried to bike outside the city limits , the " border police " were ever present .
but at least the chinese had clean air . omnipresence of the state if you were an ordinary chinese citizen , the state regulated every aspect of your life down to whether you were practicing birth control to make sure you adhered to the restrictive one-child only family policy . you could forget about choosing your own line of work or place of residence - the state assigned you a job and living quarters .
and if you wanted to get married , you needed a stamp of approval from your work unit , which had to ensure that the future spouse was " politically clean . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dress codes were more relaxed for children than adults if you were labeled a " capitalist roader " artist or intellectual , you were sent to the countryside to be " re-educated , " meaning you were tortured and persecuted .
even if you managed to come out physically alive , your spirit was broken .
this was the china that my side of the family had the luck to escape .
rejecting the chairman 's wife today 's china bears no resemblance to the big brother nation i once knew .
that does n't mean that china still does n't have a long way to go in terms of human rights and press freedoms as the beijing olympics have demonstrated , but the people 's republic has also come a very , very long way in just one generation .
china has even advanced so much economically and politically now that it has become a country my family would not have fled at the time of the communist takeover in 1949 .
my grandfather had been a shanghai industrialist who made a fortune as the chinese agent for ig farben , the pre-war amalgam of germany 's basf , bayer and hoechst today .
being a bourgeois capitalist was bad enough for the communists .
even worse , he had also produced movies , in which a two-bit actress named jiang qing was rejected for a plum role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist with german business ties could n't survive mao jiang was to later become madame mao and used her tremendous power as the chairman 's wife to exact ruthless revenge on those who had slighted her .
when it became clear that the nationalist chinese government was doomed in 1948 , shanghai 's business elite , including grandpa , knew they could n't survive under mao , so they had escaped to british hong kong before china 's borders were sealed for the next thirty years . " hong kong will take over china ! " by the 1970s , the combination of british governance and a laissez-faire economy enabled the chinese from the mainland to turn hong kong into one of asia 's four industrial tigers along with singapore , south korea and taiwan , where the nationalists had fled .
china , meanwhile , had been in the throes of the cultural revolution .
then mao died and jiang qing was purged from the party , ending an era of totalitarian communist rule and political isolation .
after a power struggle between the hardliners and pragmatists , china 's reformist leader deng xiao ping emerged in 1979 with his famous adage , " it does n't matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice . "
revolutionary ideology was out , go-go capitalism was in , and the economic advances in the last decades that have been on display during the olympics , have been breathtaking .
but along with higher living standards and double-digit growth , came greed , official corruption and environmental degradation .
why bother to ride a bike when you can drive a bmw ? bildunterschrift : the oriental pearl tv tower is a symbol of shanghai 's building boom and modernity in 1997 , the british lease on hong kong island had expired and the former crown colony was turned over to china .
when i expressed concern about the changeover , a close family friend who had been a communist official retorted , " you think mighty china is going to swallow tiny hong kong ?
balderdash !
it 's hong kong that will take over china ! "
he was right .
my german-born , teenage daughter was in shanghai earlier this year .
i asked her how it was . " i was in the oriental pearl tower , the jewish refugee museum , the shanghai cathedral , the -lrb- famous waterfront -rrb- bund ... and starbucks ! " she said , showing me photos of ultra-modern gleaming skyscrapers that outshone even hong kong . two steps forward , one step back political reform has n't kept pace with economic growth though .
the same official explained that the process of political liberalization is not a straight trajectory . " china takes two steps forward and one step back , but still moves forward , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks were able to openly worship starting the 1980s in the 1980s many temples , churches and mosques that had been smashed during the cultural revolution had been restored and religion was tolerated as long as it was kept a private matter .
china opened up to mass tourism , but kept foreign visitors on a leash .
chinese dissenters were able to come out in the open and criticize the party and its policies , but then the pro-democracy movement at tiananmen square was brutally crushed in 1989 . journalists can now travel in more remote regions than ever before , but during the games their movements are restricted in the name of national security . there are now more internet users in china than anywhere on earth , a by product of globalization .
then china 's politicos tried to control the flow of information by blocking " sensitive " news web sites , including deutsche welle 's , right before the games but a media furor convinced them to change their minds . the chinese leadership quietly indicated they are prepared to invite the dalai lama to china for talks , according to the new york times .
if tibet 's exiled spiritual leader actually sets foot on chinese soil for the first time in nearly 50 years , this would be a big step forward . and so it goes .
a political opening that goes too far and the brakes are slammed with china going into reverse gear .
two steps forward and one step back .
and forward again . diana fong is a reporter at dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this was the china that my side of the family had the luck to escape .
rejecting the chairman 's wife today 's china bears no resemblance to the big brother nation i once knew .
that does n't mean that china still does n't have a long way to go in terms of human rights and press freedoms as the beijing olympics have demonstrated , but the people 's republic has also come a very , very long way in just one generation .
china has even advanced so much economically and politically now that it has become a country my family would not have fled at the time of the communist takeover in 1949 .
my grandfather had been a shanghai industrialist who made a fortune as the chinese agent for ig farben , the pre-war amalgam of germany 's basf , bayer and hoechst today .

" hong kong will take over china ! " by the 1970s , the combination of british governance and a laissez-faire economy enabled the chinese from the mainland to turn hong kong into one of asia 's four industrial tigers along with singapore , south korea and taiwan , where the nationalists had fled .
china , meanwhile , had been in the throes of the cultural revolution .
then mao died and jiang qing was purged from the party , ending an era of totalitarian communist rule and political isolation .
after a power struggle between the hardliners and pragmatists , china 's reformist leader deng xiao ping emerged in 1979 with his famous adage , " it does n't matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice . "
revolutionary ideology was out , go-go capitalism was in , and the economic advances in the last decades that have been on display during the olympics , have been breathtaking .

i asked her how it was . " i was in the oriental pearl tower , the jewish refugee museum , the shanghai cathedral , the -lrb- famous waterfront -rrb- bund ... and starbucks !

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dress codes were more relaxed for children than adults if you were labeled a " capitalist roader " artist or intellectual , you were sent to the countryside to be " re-educated , " meaning you were tortured and persecuted .
even if you managed to come out physically alive , your spirit was broken .
this was the china that my side of the family had the luck to escape .
rejecting the chairman 's wife today 's china bears no resemblance to the big brother nation i once knew .
that does n't mean that china still does n't have a long way to go in terms of human rights and press freedoms as the beijing olympics have demonstrated , but the people 's republic has also come a very , very long way in just one generation .
china has even advanced so much economically and politically now that it has become a country my family would not have fled at the time of the communist takeover in 1949 .
my grandfather had been a shanghai industrialist who made a fortune as the chinese agent for ig farben , the pre-war amalgam of germany 's basf , bayer and hoechst today .
being a bourgeois capitalist was bad enough for the communists .
even worse , he had also produced movies , in which a two-bit actress named jiang qing was rejected for a plum role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist with german business ties could n't survive mao jiang was to later become madame mao and used her tremendous power as the chairman 's wife to exact ruthless revenge on those who had slighted her .
when it became clear that the nationalist chinese government was doomed in 1948 , shanghai 's business elite , including grandpa , knew they could n't survive under mao , so they had escaped to british hong kong before china 's borders were sealed for the next thirty years . " hong kong will take over china ! " by the 1970s , the combination of british governance and a laissez-faire economy enabled the chinese from the mainland to turn hong kong into one of asia 's four industrial tigers along with singapore , south korea and taiwan , where the nationalists had fled .
china , meanwhile , had been in the throes of the cultural revolution .
then mao died and jiang qing was purged from the party , ending an era of totalitarian communist rule and political isolation .
after a power struggle between the hardliners and pragmatists , china 's reformist leader deng xiao ping emerged in 1979 with his famous adage , " it does n't matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice . "
revolutionary ideology was out , go-go capitalism was in , and the economic advances in the last decades that have been on display during the olympics , have been breathtaking .
but along with higher living standards and double-digit growth , came greed , official corruption and environmental degradation .
why bother to ride a bike when you can drive a bmw ? bildunterschrift : the oriental pearl tv tower is a symbol of shanghai 's building boom and modernity in 1997 , the british lease on hong kong island had expired and the former crown colony was turned over to china .
when i expressed concern about the changeover , a close family friend who had been a communist official retorted , " you think mighty china is going to swallow tiny hong kong ?
balderdash !
it 's hong kong that will take over china ! "
he was right .
my german-born , teenage daughter was in shanghai earlier this year .
i asked her how it was . " i was in the oriental pearl tower , the jewish refugee museum , the shanghai cathedral , the -lrb- famous waterfront -rrb- bund ... and starbucks ! " she said , showing me photos of ultra-modern gleaming skyscrapers that outshone even hong kong . two steps forward , one step back political reform has n't kept pace with economic growth though .
the same official explained that the process of political liberalization is not a straight trajectory . " china takes two steps forward and one step back , but still moves forward , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks were able to openly worship starting the 1980s in the 1980s many temples , churches and mosques that had been smashed during the cultural revolution had been restored and religion was tolerated as long as it was kept a private matter .
china opened up to mass tourism , but kept foreign visitors on a leash .
chinese dissenters were able to come out in the open and criticize the party and its policies , but then the pro-democracy movement at tiananmen square was brutally crushed in 1989 . journalists can now travel in more remote regions than ever before , but during the games their movements are restricted in the name of national security . there are now more internet users in china than anywhere on earth , a by product of globalization .
then china 's politicos tried to control the flow of information by blocking " sensitive " news web sites , including deutsche welle 's , right before the games but a media furor convinced them to change their minds . the chinese leadership quietly indicated they are prepared to invite the dalai lama to china for talks , according to the new york times .
if tibet 's exiled spiritual leader actually sets foot on chinese soil for the first time in nearly 50 years , this would be a big step forward . and so it goes .
a political opening that goes too far and the brakes are slammed with china going into reverse gear .
two steps forward and one step back .
and forward again . diana fong is a reporter at dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his widow , helga , said that vogel had not been well after suffering a heart attack earlier in this year . the former lawyer was best known for his work as a german to german negotiator .
while working for the government of east germany , he made the transfer of over 250,000 people out of the gdr possible .
vogel also arranged the exchange of almost 34,000 political prisoners between the east and west . during the height of the cold war in the late 50s , vogel was the only point man between the west german government in bonn and the communist gdr in east berlin .
at the time both sides claimed to have no official contact . negotiating for super powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vogel oversaw the exchange of kgb spy abel and american pilot powers vogel gained a sense of acclaim , if not notoriety , for overseeing the exchange of kgb spy rudolf j. abel for gary powers in 1962 .
powers was an american pilot shot down over the ussr while flying his u-2 spy plane in 1960 . he also oversaw the exchange of others involved in espionage or imprisoned in east germany in exchange for those held in the west , including jewish dissident anatoly scharansky , who spent nearly nine years in soviet captivity on espionage charges .
in another case , in 1985 , 23 people held by east germany on espionage charges were exchanged for four agents of the german democratic republic convicted by the u.s. the mailman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schmidt once called vogel ' our mail man ' all the deals were staged on the glienicker bridge between potsdam and west berlin .
ironically , at the time , the span was known as the ‘ bridge of unity ’ , even though it only served the allies as a border crossing .
vogel 's reach inside the east german government was so extensive that when former chancellor helmut schmidt wanted to visit the country , it was vogel who helped arrange it .
schmidt later dubbed vogel “ our mail man ” .
after the fall of the berlin wall , vogel admitted that he also worked for the stasi , east germany ’ s secret police .
he was accused of blackmailing people who wanted to leave the gdr , and for selling real estate at well below market value .
however , in 1998 he was cleared of those charges by the german federal supreme court . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 22.08.2008 opinion : you 've come a long way beijing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : years ago , china did n't have a pollution problem on city streets since everyone biked china has a long way to go with democratic reforms , but the olympic games represent a milestone for how far it has already come .
dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years . the year was 1977 shortly after the death of mao , and i had gotten a special visa reserved for young “ overseas chinese ” to visit the motherland .
back then china was an impoverished police state that had just emerged from the political chaos and violence of the cultural revolution , a misnomer for a movement that destroyed any shred of culture whatsoever .
i could n't even utter the name mao in public except to glorify him , let alone criticize the chinese government .
my visa was restricted to the one city where some cousins still lived - shanghai , which many chinese call the berlin of the east for its dazzle , sophistication , progressive politics and historical baggage . striking uniformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's portrait remains , but his ideology is gone i could n't walk down the streets wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt without being interrogated by the neighborhood watchdogs about my western apparel .
everyone wore shapeless uniform jackets and baggy trousers in faded green , blue or grey . there was hardly a single western face on the streets in this most cosmopolitan of all chinese cities .
if a fair-haired , blue-eyed foreigner appeared in public , he was swarmed by a crowd of onlookers .
there were few businessmen and diplomats , no tourists and no accredited journalists in china .
physical movement was restricted by lack of transport .
there were a few city trams , no cars or subways and if anyone tried to bike outside the city limits , the " border police " were ever present .
but at least the chinese had clean air . omnipresence of the state if you were an ordinary chinese citizen , the state regulated every aspect of your life down to whether you were practicing birth control to make sure you adhered to the restrictive one-child only family policy . you could forget about choosing your own line of work or place of residence - the state assigned you a job and living quarters .
and if you wanted to get married , you needed a stamp of approval from your work unit , which had to ensure that the future spouse was " politically clean . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dress codes were more relaxed for children than adults if you were labeled a " capitalist roader " artist or intellectual , you were sent to the countryside to be " re-educated , " meaning you were tortured and persecuted .
even if you managed to come out physically alive , your spirit was broken .
this was the china that my side of the family had the luck to escape .
rejecting the chairman 's wife today 's china bears no resemblance to the big brother nation i once knew .
that does n't mean that china still does n't have a long way to go in terms of human rights and press freedoms as the beijing olympics have demonstrated , but the people 's republic has also come a very , very long way in just one generation .
china has even advanced so much economically and politically now that it has become a country my family would not have fled at the time of the communist takeover in 1949 .
my grandfather had been a shanghai industrialist who made a fortune as the chinese agent for ig farben , the pre-war amalgam of germany 's basf , bayer and hoechst today .
being a bourgeois capitalist was bad enough for the communists .
even worse , he had also produced movies , in which a two-bit actress named jiang qing was rejected for a plum role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist with german business ties could n't survive mao jiang was to later become madame mao and used her tremendous power as the chairman 's wife to exact ruthless revenge on those who had slighted her .
when it became clear that the nationalist chinese government was doomed in 1948 , shanghai 's business elite , including grandpa , knew they could n't survive under mao , so they had escaped to british hong kong before china 's borders were sealed for the next thirty years . " hong kong will take over china ! " by the 1970s , the combination of british governance and a laissez-faire economy enabled the chinese from the mainland to turn hong kong into one of asia 's four industrial tigers along with singapore , south korea and taiwan , where the nationalists had fled .
china , meanwhile , had been in the throes of the cultural revolution .
then mao died and jiang qing was purged from the party , ending an era of totalitarian communist rule and political isolation .
after a power struggle between the hardliners and pragmatists , china 's reformist leader deng xiao ping emerged in 1979 with his famous adage , " it does n't matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice . "
revolutionary ideology was out , go-go capitalism was in , and the economic advances in the last decades that have been on display during the olympics , have been breathtaking .
but along with higher living standards and double-digit growth , came greed , official corruption and environmental degradation .
why bother to ride a bike when you can drive a bmw ? bildunterschrift : the oriental pearl tv tower is a symbol of shanghai 's building boom and modernity in 1997 , the british lease on hong kong island had expired and the former crown colony was turned over to china .
when i expressed concern about the changeover , a close family friend who had been a communist official retorted , " you think mighty china is going to swallow tiny hong kong ?
balderdash !
it 's hong kong that will take over china ! "
he was right .
my german-born , teenage daughter was in shanghai earlier this year .
i asked her how it was . " i was in the oriental pearl tower , the jewish refugee museum , the shanghai cathedral , the -lrb- famous waterfront -rrb- bund ... and starbucks ! " she said , showing me photos of ultra-modern gleaming skyscrapers that outshone even hong kong . two steps forward , one step back political reform has n't kept pace with economic growth though .
the same official explained that the process of political liberalization is not a straight trajectory . " china takes two steps forward and one step back , but still moves forward , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks were able to openly worship starting the 1980s in the 1980s many temples , churches and mosques that had been smashed during the cultural revolution had been restored and religion was tolerated as long as it was kept a private matter .
china opened up to mass tourism , but kept foreign visitors on a leash .
chinese dissenters were able to come out in the open and criticize the party and its policies , but then the pro-democracy movement at tiananmen square was brutally crushed in 1989 . journalists can now travel in more remote regions than ever before , but during the games their movements are restricted in the name of national security . there are now more internet users in china than anywhere on earth , a by product of globalization .
then china 's politicos tried to control the flow of information by blocking " sensitive " news web sites , including deutsche welle 's , right before the games but a media furor convinced them to change their minds . the chinese leadership quietly indicated they are prepared to invite the dalai lama to china for talks , according to the new york times .
if tibet 's exiled spiritual leader actually sets foot on chinese soil for the first time in nearly 50 years , this would be a big step forward . and so it goes .
a political opening that goes too far and the brakes are slammed with china going into reverse gear .
two steps forward and one step back .
and forward again . diana fong is a reporter at dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years . the year was 1977 shortly after the death of mao , and i had gotten a special visa reserved for young “ overseas chinese ” to visit the motherland .
back then china was an impoverished police state that had just emerged from the political chaos and violence of the cultural revolution , a misnomer for a movement that destroyed any shred of culture whatsoever .
i could n't even utter the name mao in public except to glorify him , let alone criticize the chinese government .
my visa was restricted to the one city where some cousins still lived - shanghai , which many chinese call the berlin of the east for its dazzle , sophistication , progressive politics and historical baggage . striking uniformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's portrait remains , but his ideology is gone i could n't walk down the streets wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt without being interrogated by the neighborhood watchdogs about my western apparel .
everyone wore shapeless uniform jackets and baggy trousers in faded green , blue or grey . there was hardly a single western face on the streets in this most cosmopolitan of all chinese cities .
if a fair-haired , blue-eyed foreigner appeared in public , he was swarmed by a crowd of onlookers .
there were few businessmen and diplomats , no tourists and no accredited journalists in china .
physical movement was restricted by lack of transport .
there were a few city trams , no cars or subways and if anyone tried to bike outside the city limits , the " border police " were ever present .
but at least the chinese had clean air . omnipresence of the state if you were an ordinary chinese citizen , the state regulated every aspect of your life down to whether you were practicing birth control to make sure you adhered to the restrictive one-child only family policy . you could forget about choosing your own line of work or place of residence - the state assigned you a job and living quarters .
and if you wanted to get married , you needed a stamp of approval from your work unit , which had to ensure that the future spouse was " politically clean . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dress codes were more relaxed for children than adults if you were labeled a " capitalist roader " artist or intellectual , you were sent to the countryside to be " re-educated , " meaning you were tortured and persecuted .
even if you managed to come out physically alive , your spirit was broken .
this was the china that my side of the family had the luck to escape .
rejecting the chairman 's wife today 's china bears no resemblance to the big brother nation i once knew .
that does n't mean that china still does n't have a long way to go in terms of human rights and press freedoms as the beijing olympics have demonstrated , but the people 's republic has also come a very , very long way in just one generation .
china has even advanced so much economically and politically now that it has become a country my family would not have fled at the time of the communist takeover in 1949 .
my grandfather had been a shanghai industrialist who made a fortune as the chinese agent for ig farben , the pre-war amalgam of germany 's basf , bayer and hoechst today .
being a bourgeois capitalist was bad enough for the communists .
even worse , he had also produced movies , in which a two-bit actress named jiang qing was rejected for a plum role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist with german business ties could n't survive mao jiang was to later become madame mao and used her tremendous power as the chairman 's wife to exact ruthless revenge on those who had slighted her .
when it became clear that the nationalist chinese government was doomed in 1948 , shanghai 's business elite , including grandpa , knew they could n't survive under mao , so they had escaped to british hong kong before china 's borders were sealed for the next thirty years . " hong kong will take over china ! " by the 1970s , the combination of british governance and a laissez-faire economy enabled the chinese from the mainland to turn hong kong into one of asia 's four industrial tigers along with singapore , south korea and taiwan , where the nationalists had fled .
china , meanwhile , had been in the throes of the cultural revolution .
then mao died and jiang qing was purged from the party , ending an era of totalitarian communist rule and political isolation .
after a power struggle between the hardliners and pragmatists , china 's reformist leader deng xiao ping emerged in 1979 with his famous adage , " it does n't matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice . "
revolutionary ideology was out , go-go capitalism was in , and the economic advances in the last decades that have been on display during the olympics , have been breathtaking .
but along with higher living standards and double-digit growth , came greed , official corruption and environmental degradation .
why bother to ride a bike when you can drive a bmw ? bildunterschrift : the oriental pearl tv tower is a symbol of shanghai 's building boom and modernity in 1997 , the british lease on hong kong island had expired and the former crown colony was turned over to china .
when i expressed concern about the changeover , a close family friend who had been a communist official retorted , " you think mighty china is going to swallow tiny hong kong ?
balderdash !
it 's hong kong that will take over china ! "
he was right .
my german-born , teenage daughter was in shanghai earlier this year .
i asked her how it was . " i was in the oriental pearl tower , the jewish refugee museum , the shanghai cathedral , the -lrb- famous waterfront -rrb- bund ... and starbucks ! " she said , showing me photos of ultra-modern gleaming skyscrapers that outshone even hong kong . two steps forward , one step back political reform has n't kept pace with economic growth though .
the same official explained that the process of political liberalization is not a straight trajectory . " china takes two steps forward and one step back , but still moves forward , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks were able to openly worship starting the 1980s in the 1980s many temples , churches and mosques that had been smashed during the cultural revolution had been restored and religion was tolerated as long as it was kept a private matter .
china opened up to mass tourism , but kept foreign visitors on a leash .
chinese dissenters were able to come out in the open and criticize the party and its policies , but then the pro-democracy movement at tiananmen square was brutally crushed in 1989 . journalists can now travel in more remote regions than ever before , but during the games their movements are restricted in the name of national security . there are now more internet users in china than anywhere on earth , a by product of globalization .
then china 's politicos tried to control the flow of information by blocking " sensitive " news web sites , including deutsche welle 's , right before the games but a media furor convinced them to change their minds . the chinese leadership quietly indicated they are prepared to invite the dalai lama to china for talks , according to the new york times .
if tibet 's exiled spiritual leader actually sets foot on chinese soil for the first time in nearly 50 years , this would be a big step forward . and so it goes .
a political opening that goes too far and the brakes are slammed with china going into reverse gear .
two steps forward and one step back .
and forward again . diana fong is a reporter at dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 but were still operating checkpoints despite pledges to leave by the end of the day .
columns were reportedly headed for south ossetia and abkhazia . as the united nations again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict , russia finally began to withdraw , in line with a french-brokered plan , from the strongly pro-western ex-soviet republic .
the russian general staff said that troops were " in the final stage of pulling back , " but they would continue to hold buffer zones and maintain peacekeeping forces in the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .
the united states has criticized the planned buffer zone as a half-way measure that fails to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
russian armored columns were moving north from the central gori sector in south ossetia , but a defensive cordon remained in place with checkpoints outside gori and near the georgian village of igoeti .
troops heading for south ossetia and abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west and georgia say russia is dragging its heels twenty russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops were seen heading north from near the georgian city of gori toward the separatist region of south ossetia , reporters said .
the nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armored personnel carriers headed towards the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian troopers driving northward on the gori-tskhinvali road shouted " russia ! " and " we 're going home ! "
but reconnaissance , tank , and infantry peacekeepers operating checkpoints in the vicinity said they had not received orders to evacuate .
russian infantry were continuing to dig in on high ground overlooking a river bridge near igoeti .
fuel tankers were refueling tanks and armored personnel carriers , and supply lorries were delivering food and water to russian troops .
the russian military said 18 additional russian checkpoints were being set up as part of russian-controlled buffer zones along the borders between central georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia respectively .
a contingent of 2,142 russian peacekeeping forces would remain in abkhazia and 452 troops in south ossetia , colonel general nogovitsyn said .
russian forces would be out of georgia proper by 20:00 local time , he said .
criticism continues over delay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columns of troops are heading for the rebel regions aleksander lomia , georgia 's national security council head , in mid-afternoon gave tbilisi 's first official acknowledgement of the russian withdrawal , saying russian forces " were pulling out , but not fast enough , " according to an interfax report .
international criticism has mounted that moscow is delaying withdrawing its troops from georgian territory in accordance with a ceasefire that ended the 10-day conflict .
us president george w bush called for an end to the russian " siege " in a telephone conversation on thursday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , a us ally .
but russian military commanders brushed aside bush 's demands , saying they were complying with the peace accord .
" the president of the united states is on vacation .
obviously , he is not receiving timely information .
we recommend the president 's press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences , " nogovitsyn said .
russians manning checkpoints along the tbilisi-gori road were permitting civilian and humanitarian traffic to pass , but were blocking " unscheduled " diplomats and media .
a russian national flag flew over the gori checkpoint .
georgia 's western region also saw substantial russian withdrawals on friday , with amour and infantry abandoning georgian government buildings in the centre of zugdidi , a town near the border with abkhazia , the georgian secessionist province loyal to moscow .
the western town of senaki , site of georgia 's largest air base , and the port of poti , on the black sea coast , had seen no reductions in russian occupation forces by early afternoon on friday .
russian forces rolled into georgia on august 8 to push back a georgian offensive to re-take control of its rebel south ossetia region , which won de facto autonomy in a civil war in the early 1990s .
russian troops also moved forward in georgia 's other breakaway region of abkhazia , and seized key strategic bases in georgia , including poti .

on thursday , tens of thousands gathered in sukhumi , capital of abkhazia , to demand russian recognition of their independence .
over 1,000 people attended a similar rally in south ossetia 's main town and on friday , the south ossetia parliament formally asked russia to recognize its independence , ria novosti news agency reported .
moscow has hinted at giving both recognition in a move that would risk sparking one of the deepest crises between russia and the west since the cold war .
russia 's two houses of parliament are to discuss the issue monday .
the kremlin has suggested that kosovo serve as a precedent in international law for recognizing the two rebel regions ' bid for independence . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in total , baa runs seven british airports . the final decision over the future of the airports would be taken in april , said the commission , which had found that the undivided ownership of britain 's leading airports was having " adverse consequences " on air traffic for passengers and airlines . reacting to the report , baa chief colin matthews insisted the company would not sell heathrow , yet he conceded the watchdog 's findings on " poor service " and " frustration " for passengers . german firm watching baa situation in germany , essen-based company hochtief said it continued to have a " great interest " in gatwick , the uk 's second-largest airport . hochtief is germany 's largest construction company with subsidiaries in the us and australia . however , it remained unclear at this time when and under which conditions the company would get involved , a company spokeswoman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baa-owned stansted airport may be up for sale in the near future she said the company would also be interested in other baa airports should they become available .

the company is currently considering stakes in airports in riga , st. petersburg and prague . delays , service standards to blame baa , which belongs to spanish multinational grupo ferrovial , has come under pressure in recent years over delays and service standards at its airports .
the report especially blamed the company for slow responses to passenger concerns and the failure to expand its airports ' capacities . the company reacted by accusing the competition watchdog of errors in judgment and said an airport sale would be counterproductive . airlines including ryanair , virgin atlantic airways and easyjet welcomed the commission 's findings . british airport operator manchester airport group also expressed interest in one of the three london hubs , which process 90 percent of all air traffic into london . the group , which operates airports in manchester , bournemouth , east midlands and humberside , said it was considering " one or more " baa airports . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 but were still operating checkpoints despite pledges to leave by the end of the day .
columns were reportedly headed for south ossetia and abkhazia . as the united nations again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict , russia finally began to withdraw , in line with a french-brokered plan , from the strongly pro-western ex-soviet republic .
the russian general staff said that troops were " in the final stage of pulling back , " but they would continue to hold buffer zones and maintain peacekeeping forces in the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .
the united states has criticized the planned buffer zone as a half-way measure that fails to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
russian armored columns were moving north from the central gori sector in south ossetia , but a defensive cordon remained in place with checkpoints outside gori and near the georgian village of igoeti .
troops heading for south ossetia and abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west and georgia say russia is dragging its heels twenty russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops were seen heading north from near the georgian city of gori toward the separatist region of south ossetia , reporters said .
the nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armored personnel carriers headed towards the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian troopers driving northward on the gori-tskhinvali road shouted " russia ! " and " we 're going home ! "
but reconnaissance , tank , and infantry peacekeepers operating checkpoints in the vicinity said they had not received orders to evacuate .
russian infantry were continuing to dig in on high ground overlooking a river bridge near igoeti .
fuel tankers were refueling tanks and armored personnel carriers , and supply lorries were delivering food and water to russian troops .
the russian military said 18 additional russian checkpoints were being set up as part of russian-controlled buffer zones along the borders between central georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia respectively .
a contingent of 2,142 russian peacekeeping forces would remain in abkhazia and 452 troops in south ossetia , colonel general nogovitsyn said .
russian forces would be out of georgia proper by 20:00 local time , he said .
criticism continues over delay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columns of troops are heading for the rebel regions aleksander lomia , georgia 's national security council head , in mid-afternoon gave tbilisi 's first official acknowledgement of the russian withdrawal , saying russian forces " were pulling out , but not fast enough , " according to an interfax report .
international criticism has mounted that moscow is delaying withdrawing its troops from georgian territory in accordance with a ceasefire that ended the 10-day conflict .
us president george w bush called for an end to the russian " siege " in a telephone conversation on thursday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , a us ally .
but russian military commanders brushed aside bush 's demands , saying they were complying with the peace accord .
" the president of the united states is on vacation .
obviously , he is not receiving timely information .
we recommend the president 's press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences , " nogovitsyn said .
russians manning checkpoints along the tbilisi-gori road were permitting civilian and humanitarian traffic to pass , but were blocking " unscheduled " diplomats and media .
a russian national flag flew over the gori checkpoint .
georgia 's western region also saw substantial russian withdrawals on friday , with amour and infantry abandoning georgian government buildings in the centre of zugdidi , a town near the border with abkhazia , the georgian secessionist province loyal to moscow .
the western town of senaki , site of georgia 's largest air base , and the port of poti , on the black sea coast , had seen no reductions in russian occupation forces by early afternoon on friday .
russian forces rolled into georgia on august 8 to push back a georgian offensive to re-take control of its rebel south ossetia region , which won de facto autonomy in a civil war in the early 1990s .
russian troops also moved forward in georgia 's other breakaway region of abkhazia , and seized key strategic bases in georgia , including poti .

over 1,000 people attended a similar rally in south ossetia 's main town and on friday , the south ossetia parliament formally asked russia to recognize its independence , ria novosti news agency reported .
moscow has hinted at giving both recognition in a move that would risk sparking one of the deepest crises between russia and the west since the cold war .

22 but were still operating checkpoints despite pledges to leave by the end of the day .
columns were reportedly headed for south ossetia and abkhazia . as the united nations again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict , russia finally began to withdraw , in line with a french-brokered plan , from the strongly pro-western ex-soviet republic .
the russian general staff said that troops were " in the final stage of pulling back , " but they would continue to hold buffer zones and maintain peacekeeping forces in the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .
the united states has criticized the planned buffer zone as a half-way measure that fails to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
russian armored columns were moving north from the central gori sector in south ossetia , but a defensive cordon remained in place with checkpoints outside gori and near the georgian village of igoeti .
troops heading for south ossetia and abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west and georgia say russia is dragging its heels twenty russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops were seen heading north from near the georgian city of gori toward the separatist region of south ossetia , reporters said .
the nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armored personnel carriers headed towards the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian troopers driving northward on the gori-tskhinvali road shouted " russia ! " and " we 're going home ! "
but reconnaissance , tank , and infantry peacekeepers operating checkpoints in the vicinity said they had not received orders to evacuate .
russian infantry were continuing to dig in on high ground overlooking a river bridge near igoeti .
fuel tankers were refueling tanks and armored personnel carriers , and supply lorries were delivering food and water to russian troops .
the russian military said 18 additional russian checkpoints were being set up as part of russian-controlled buffer zones along the borders between central georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia respectively .
a contingent of 2,142 russian peacekeeping forces would remain in abkhazia and 452 troops in south ossetia , colonel general nogovitsyn said .
russian forces would be out of georgia proper by 20:00 local time , he said .
criticism continues over delay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columns of troops are heading for the rebel regions aleksander lomia , georgia 's national security council head , in mid-afternoon gave tbilisi 's first official acknowledgement of the russian withdrawal , saying russian forces " were pulling out , but not fast enough , " according to an interfax report .
international criticism has mounted that moscow is delaying withdrawing its troops from georgian territory in accordance with a ceasefire that ended the 10-day conflict .
us president george w bush called for an end to the russian " siege " in a telephone conversation on thursday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , a us ally .
but russian military commanders brushed aside bush 's demands , saying they were complying with the peace accord .
" the president of the united states is on vacation .
obviously , he is not receiving timely information .
we recommend the president 's press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences , " nogovitsyn said .
russians manning checkpoints along the tbilisi-gori road were permitting civilian and humanitarian traffic to pass , but were blocking " unscheduled " diplomats and media .
a russian national flag flew over the gori checkpoint .
georgia 's western region also saw substantial russian withdrawals on friday , with amour and infantry abandoning georgian government buildings in the centre of zugdidi , a town near the border with abkhazia , the georgian secessionist province loyal to moscow .
the western town of senaki , site of georgia 's largest air base , and the port of poti , on the black sea coast , had seen no reductions in russian occupation forces by early afternoon on friday .
russian forces rolled into georgia on august 8 to push back a georgian offensive to re-take control of its rebel south ossetia region , which won de facto autonomy in a civil war in the early 1990s .
russian troops also moved forward in georgia 's other breakaway region of abkhazia , and seized key strategic bases in georgia , including poti .

on thursday , tens of thousands gathered in sukhumi , capital of abkhazia , to demand russian recognition of their independence .
over 1,000 people attended a similar rally in south ossetia 's main town and on friday , the south ossetia parliament formally asked russia to recognize its independence , ria novosti news agency reported .
moscow has hinted at giving both recognition in a move that would risk sparking one of the deepest crises between russia and the west since the cold war .
russia 's two houses of parliament are to discuss the issue monday .
the kremlin has suggested that kosovo serve as a precedent in international law for recognizing the two rebel regions ' bid for independence . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 but were still operating checkpoints despite pledges to leave by the end of the day .
columns were reportedly headed for south ossetia and abkhazia . as the united nations again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict , russia finally began to withdraw , in line with a french-brokered plan , from the strongly pro-western ex-soviet republic .
the russian general staff said that troops were " in the final stage of pulling back , " but they would continue to hold buffer zones and maintain peacekeeping forces in the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .
the united states has criticized the planned buffer zone as a half-way measure that fails to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
russian armored columns were moving north from the central gori sector in south ossetia , but a defensive cordon remained in place with checkpoints outside gori and near the georgian village of igoeti .
troops heading for south ossetia and abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west and georgia say russia is dragging its heels twenty russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops were seen heading north from near the georgian city of gori toward the separatist region of south ossetia , reporters said .
the nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armored personnel carriers headed towards the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian troopers driving northward on the gori-tskhinvali road shouted " russia ! " and " we 're going home ! "
but reconnaissance , tank , and infantry peacekeepers operating checkpoints in the vicinity said they had not received orders to evacuate .
russian infantry were continuing to dig in on high ground overlooking a river bridge near igoeti .
fuel tankers were refueling tanks and armored personnel carriers , and supply lorries were delivering food and water to russian troops .
the russian military said 18 additional russian checkpoints were being set up as part of russian-controlled buffer zones along the borders between central georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia respectively .
a contingent of 2,142 russian peacekeeping forces would remain in abkhazia and 452 troops in south ossetia , colonel general nogovitsyn said .
russian forces would be out of georgia proper by 20:00 local time , he said .
criticism continues over delay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columns of troops are heading for the rebel regions aleksander lomia , georgia 's national security council head , in mid-afternoon gave tbilisi 's first official acknowledgement of the russian withdrawal , saying russian forces " were pulling out , but not fast enough , " according to an interfax report .
international criticism has mounted that moscow is delaying withdrawing its troops from georgian territory in accordance with a ceasefire that ended the 10-day conflict .
us president george w bush called for an end to the russian " siege " in a telephone conversation on thursday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , a us ally .
but russian military commanders brushed aside bush 's demands , saying they were complying with the peace accord .
" the president of the united states is on vacation .
obviously , he is not receiving timely information .
we recommend the president 's press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences , " nogovitsyn said .
russians manning checkpoints along the tbilisi-gori road were permitting civilian and humanitarian traffic to pass , but were blocking " unscheduled " diplomats and media .
a russian national flag flew over the gori checkpoint .
georgia 's western region also saw substantial russian withdrawals on friday , with amour and infantry abandoning georgian government buildings in the centre of zugdidi , a town near the border with abkhazia , the georgian secessionist province loyal to moscow .
the western town of senaki , site of georgia 's largest air base , and the port of poti , on the black sea coast , had seen no reductions in russian occupation forces by early afternoon on friday .
russian forces rolled into georgia on august 8 to push back a georgian offensive to re-take control of its rebel south ossetia region , which won de facto autonomy in a civil war in the early 1990s .
russian troops also moved forward in georgia 's other breakaway region of abkhazia , and seized key strategic bases in georgia , including poti .

on thursday , tens of thousands gathered in sukhumi , capital of abkhazia , to demand russian recognition of their independence .
over 1,000 people attended a similar rally in south ossetia 's main town and on friday , the south ossetia parliament formally asked russia to recognize its independence , ria novosti news agency reported .
moscow has hinted at giving both recognition in a move that would risk sparking one of the deepest crises between russia and the west since the cold war .
russia 's two houses of parliament are to discuss the issue monday .
the kremlin has suggested that kosovo serve as a precedent in international law for recognizing the two rebel regions ' bid for independence . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 but were still operating checkpoints despite pledges to leave by the end of the day .
columns were reportedly headed for south ossetia and abkhazia . as the united nations again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict , russia finally began to withdraw , in line with a french-brokered plan , from the strongly pro-western ex-soviet republic .
the russian general staff said that troops were " in the final stage of pulling back , " but they would continue to hold buffer zones and maintain peacekeeping forces in the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .
the united states has criticized the planned buffer zone as a half-way measure that fails to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
russian armored columns were moving north from the central gori sector in south ossetia , but a defensive cordon remained in place with checkpoints outside gori and near the georgian village of igoeti .
troops heading for south ossetia and abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west and georgia say russia is dragging its heels twenty russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops were seen heading north from near the georgian city of gori toward the separatist region of south ossetia , reporters said .
the nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armored personnel carriers headed towards the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian troopers driving northward on the gori-tskhinvali road shouted " russia ! " and " we 're going home ! "
but reconnaissance , tank , and infantry peacekeepers operating checkpoints in the vicinity said they had not received orders to evacuate .
russian infantry were continuing to dig in on high ground overlooking a river bridge near igoeti .
fuel tankers were refueling tanks and armored personnel carriers , and supply lorries were delivering food and water to russian troops .
the russian military said 18 additional russian checkpoints were being set up as part of russian-controlled buffer zones along the borders between central georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia respectively .
a contingent of 2,142 russian peacekeeping forces would remain in abkhazia and 452 troops in south ossetia , colonel general nogovitsyn said .
russian forces would be out of georgia proper by 20:00 local time , he said .
criticism continues over delay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columns of troops are heading for the rebel regions aleksander lomia , georgia 's national security council head , in mid-afternoon gave tbilisi 's first official acknowledgement of the russian withdrawal , saying russian forces " were pulling out , but not fast enough , " according to an interfax report .
international criticism has mounted that moscow is delaying withdrawing its troops from georgian territory in accordance with a ceasefire that ended the 10-day conflict .
us president george w bush called for an end to the russian " siege " in a telephone conversation on thursday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , a us ally .
but russian military commanders brushed aside bush 's demands , saying they were complying with the peace accord .
" the president of the united states is on vacation .
obviously , he is not receiving timely information .
we recommend the president 's press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences , " nogovitsyn said .
russians manning checkpoints along the tbilisi-gori road were permitting civilian and humanitarian traffic to pass , but were blocking " unscheduled " diplomats and media .
a russian national flag flew over the gori checkpoint .
georgia 's western region also saw substantial russian withdrawals on friday , with amour and infantry abandoning georgian government buildings in the centre of zugdidi , a town near the border with abkhazia , the georgian secessionist province loyal to moscow .
the western town of senaki , site of georgia 's largest air base , and the port of poti , on the black sea coast , had seen no reductions in russian occupation forces by early afternoon on friday .
russian forces rolled into georgia on august 8 to push back a georgian offensive to re-take control of its rebel south ossetia region , which won de facto autonomy in a civil war in the early 1990s .
russian troops also moved forward in georgia 's other breakaway region of abkhazia , and seized key strategic bases in georgia , including poti .

but the next us president will have to repair ties with russia . in a rare show of solidarity with the republican incumbent , democratic presidential hopeful obama said on thursday , aug .
21 , that he agreed with president george w. bush 's stance toward russia following the recent five-day conflict with georgia . " i 'm supportive of what george bush has been doing , " said obama , who disagrees with bush on most foreign policy issues .
" there will be a time later for politics .
i 'm a big believer that when you 're in a crisis , america speaks with one voice . " bush , who has nurtured positive personal relations with russian prime minister vladimir putin over the past eight years , has firmly denounced russia 's decision to send troops into georgia after the former soviet republic attacked the separatist region of south ossetia on aug .
8 . while the west has largely condemned russia 's military involvement in georgia , russia has sharply criticized georgia for attacking its breakaway provinces . new chapter in us-russia relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama agrees with bush - at least as far as the caucasus war is concerned the us president has insisted that georgia 's territorial sovereignty be respected .
the pro-russian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia have enjoyed de facto independence from georgia since the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 . nevertheless , the clash with russia has put the chill on us-russian relations . the conflict in the caucasus " indicates a new stage in the relationship between russia and the west , " said obama thursday .
" we 've got to be firm with the russians , in alliance with our european allies , that this kind of behavior is intolerable . " both obama and republican presidential hopeful john mccain have warned russia of severe , long-term consequences from its conflict with georgia . the united states is caught somewhat between a rock and a hard place as it is dependent on russia 's approval in the united nations security council , where moscow enjoys veto power , on a number of international issues . georgia becomes presidential battlefield mccain , who is slightly behind obama in polls , has used the russian-georgian conflict to draw attention to his extensive foreign policy experience .
a vietnam veteran , former prisoner of war , and long-time us senator , mccain has said he is better suited than his significantly younger opponent to take on the position of commander-in-chief . obama , a first-term senator from illinois with no military experience , recently made a highly publicized tour of europe in an effort to boost his image on the foreign policy front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain , seen here with us troops in iraq , said his military experience better qualifies him mccain has gone beyond the white house 's stance in his response to russia in light of the fighting in georgia , demanding that russia be expelled from the group of eight highly industrialized nations , at least for a time .
he has also expressed opposition to russian membership in the world trade organization . " in matters of national security , good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president - as we were all reminded ... by the events in the nation of georgia , " said mccain earlier this week . advice from all sides obama promised thursday , addressing supporters in virginia , to call on the " best and brightest " foreign policy advisors , should he be elected . " and by the way , they do n't have to be democrats , " he said , naming republican richard lugar , who is chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , among others . as far as foreign policy matters are concerned , mccain and obama differ most notably in their approach to the war in iraq , which is largely unpopular in europe . obama has pledged to withdraw nearly all us troops from iraq within 16 months , while mccain has promised to remain until victory . addressing us foreign policy as a whole on thursday , obama conceded , however , that " there are times when we are going to have to use military force .

and though they 're too young to remember the cold war , they still feel the old grievances . mariam sits in the main garden outside the university in bonn , germany .
it 's a warm august evening and the sun has just set .
mariam does n't notice .
she is too caught up in the thoughts running through her mind .
mariam , a university student , says she is afraid every day .
afraid for her family and her country . " each day i call my mother in tbilisi and if she does n't answer i am totally overcome by fear .
i 'm convinced that a russian bomb landed on our house , " she says . rage towards russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariam fears for her family 's safety for the past four years mariam has lived in germany , studying economics .
she would like to return to her homeland , but at the moment she does n't dare .
she and her georgian friends follow the unrest in her native country on the television and the internet . mariam and her sister , mtvarisa , are furious with russia and the russian president .
mtvarisa says that russia just can not deal with the fact that georgia is developing in a western fashion . georgia has a very strategic position .
gas and oil pipelines pass through our country , and of course the russians want to control them , she adds . " we have to defend ourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers are out in full force against the russians nino also firmly believes in her country and the georgian president .
she finds saakashvili 's actions commendable .
" we have to defend ourselves , " she says .
it sounds like something memorized at a young age .
nino has been in germany for a year , and is waiting for a spot to open up for her to study medicine . she has just turned 20 .
she never experienced the cold war .
nevertheless , even she feels some of the old hatred when she sees the former frontlines re-outlined : east against west , russia against america - and georgia in the middle , sitting on the fence .
georgia is like a buffer state with an overpowering adversary standing at the door . enemies at the disco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nino completely supports her government for the young georgians , a russian is someone to hate , not to have as a friend .
that 's how it 's always been .
because of that , nino could never imagine herself falling in love with a russian boy , not even here in germany . " after everything that has happened between our countries , it is n't possible anymore , " she says defensively , shaking her head . the young georgian has brought this hate , anger and fear with her to germany .
luckily there are n't any russians living in her dormitory , she says .
though she came across a few in the street one evening recently .
a couple of russian students who were looking for a disco asked nino and mariam if they knew where one was . mariam recognized the accent immediately .
when she and nino told the russians where they were from , the mood darkened , she explains . " and when they asked where we were from , and we told them that we 're georgians , they became aggressive .
one boy screamed : ' russia will kill georgia ' .
i said , you are our enemies , but we will gladly help you find a disco , " she says . " there is no peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian soldiers have still not withdrawn from the country the only solution is for the russians to leave , agree the two students .
they are afraid that russia will simply annex georgia and remove the government . " i could never live under a russian government , " says mariam .
" i am georgian and proud of it . " " there is no peace , " says nino , " the war is over , but the people are still afraid of the russians .
they are still in georgia and refuse to leave .
they ’ re aiming their rockets at tbilisi . " " m-schwi-do-ba " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtvarisa , nino , tamta und mariam occasionally the students have doubts about their hatred for russia , though it 's rare .
sometimes they meet russians who are actually very nice .
like the woman at the language course at the community college .
mariam quickly became friends with this potential enemy .
it didn ’ t last .
" the politics destroyed our friendship , " she says , sadly . because despite all the anger , the georgian students only want one thing : " m-shvi-do-ba , " they say .

and though they 're too young to remember the cold war , they still feel the old grievances . mariam sits in the main garden outside the university in bonn , germany .
it 's a warm august evening and the sun has just set .
mariam does n't notice .
she is too caught up in the thoughts running through her mind .
mariam , a university student , says she is afraid every day .
afraid for her family and her country . " each day i call my mother in tbilisi and if she does n't answer i am totally overcome by fear .
i 'm convinced that a russian bomb landed on our house , " she says . rage towards russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariam fears for her family 's safety for the past four years mariam has lived in germany , studying economics .
she would like to return to her homeland , but at the moment she does n't dare .
she and her georgian friends follow the unrest in her native country on the television and the internet . mariam and her sister , mtvarisa , are furious with russia and the russian president .
mtvarisa says that russia just can not deal with the fact that georgia is developing in a western fashion . georgia has a very strategic position .
gas and oil pipelines pass through our country , and of course the russians want to control them , she adds . " we have to defend ourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers are out in full force against the russians nino also firmly believes in her country and the georgian president .
she finds saakashvili 's actions commendable .

it sounds like something memorized at a young age .
nino has been in germany for a year , and is waiting for a spot to open up for her to study medicine . she has just turned 20 .
she never experienced the cold war .
nevertheless , even she feels some of the old hatred when she sees the former frontlines re-outlined : east against west , russia against america - and georgia in the middle , sitting on the fence .
georgia is like a buffer state with an overpowering adversary standing at the door . enemies at the disco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nino completely supports her government for the young georgians , a russian is someone to hate , not to have as a friend .
that 's how it 's always been .

" after everything that has happened between our countries , it is n't possible anymore , " she says defensively , shaking her head . the young georgian has brought this hate , anger and fear with her to germany .
luckily there are n't any russians living in her dormitory , she says .
though she came across a few in the street one evening recently .
a couple of russian students who were looking for a disco asked nino and mariam if they knew where one was . mariam recognized the accent immediately .
when she and nino told the russians where they were from , the mood darkened , she explains . " and when they asked where we were from , and we told them that we 're georgians , they became aggressive .
one boy screamed : ' russia will kill georgia ' .
i said , you are our enemies , but we will gladly help you find a disco , " she says . " there is no peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian soldiers have still not withdrawn from the country the only solution is for the russians to leave , agree the two students .
they are afraid that russia will simply annex georgia and remove the government . " i could never live under a russian government , " says mariam .
" i am georgian and proud of it . " " there is no peace , " says nino , " the war is over , but the people are still afraid of the russians .

mariam quickly became friends with this potential enemy .
it didn ’ t last .

troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .
however , in the interview with german public broadcaster ard on friday , he added that moscow 's use of force in georgia was " fully disproportionate " to the severity of the situation . buffer zone a point of contention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian president has rejected the idea of a buffer zone russian president dmitry medvedev has promised that all but 500 russian troops would be withdrawn from georgia by then . moscow said those remaining troops would be stationed in what it termed as " zone of responsibility " as part of a peacekeeping operation to protect south ossetia .
this would leave russian troops present inside the georgian heartland and close to its economically vital east-west highway .
boldryev made no reference those 500 troops in his remarks . georgian president mikhail saakashvili has said he would not stand for their presence . " there will be no buffer zones , " he told reuters news agency in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
" we will never live with any buffer zones .

" by monday most of the equipment will be in place - especially the armored vehicles - we will have our staff here , we will have our operational center set up and we can start sending out monitors into various parts in georgia and neighboring south ossetia , " said alexander stubb , the pan-european security organization 's chairman . his comments came while visiting a refugee camp on the outskirts of tbilisi .
he had earlier traveled through russian-controlled checkpoints to the city of gori where russian troops were still present , deep inside georgia . stubb , who is also the finnish foreign minister , said he had witnessed " atrocious sights . " " there are russian interior ministry special forces bringing old people from villages , basically emptying the villages on the south ossetian side and dumping them in gori , " he told reuters . no agreement at security council russia late thursday submitted a formal text to the un security council aimed at ending the conflict in georgia , but the united states and britain said they were not ready to vote for it . the 15-nation council also had a second draft resolution for consideration from france , the current president of the european union , which called for the immediate and definite withdrawal of russian troops from georgia , including south ossetia and abkhazia , a cease-fire and international negotiations to settle the issues between georgia and russia . british ambassador john sawers told reporters following a two-hour closed-door discussion by the council that the body was not ready to adopt either the russian or the french draft because of the unsettled conditions on the ground in georgia .

troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .
however , in the interview with german public broadcaster ard on friday , he added that moscow 's use of force in georgia was " fully disproportionate " to the severity of the situation . buffer zone a point of contention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian president has rejected the idea of a buffer zone russian president dmitry medvedev has promised that all but 500 russian troops would be withdrawn from georgia by then . moscow said those remaining troops would be stationed in what it termed as " zone of responsibility " as part of a peacekeeping operation to protect south ossetia .
this would leave russian troops present inside the georgian heartland and close to its economically vital east-west highway .
boldryev made no reference those 500 troops in his remarks . georgian president mikhail saakashvili has said he would not stand for their presence . " there will be no buffer zones , " he told reuters news agency in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
" we will never live with any buffer zones .
we 'll never allow anything like this . " osce observers due monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee camp for georgians from south ossetia and gori meanwhile , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has announced that twenty of its observers will be ready to start monitoring a ceasefire between georgia and russia from monday . " by monday most of the equipment will be in place - especially the armored vehicles - we will have our staff here , we will have our operational center set up and we can start sending out monitors into various parts in georgia and neighboring south ossetia , " said alexander stubb , the pan-european security organization 's chairman . his comments came while visiting a refugee camp on the outskirts of tbilisi .
he had earlier traveled through russian-controlled checkpoints to the city of gori where russian troops were still present , deep inside georgia . stubb , who is also the finnish foreign minister , said he had witnessed " atrocious sights . " " there are russian interior ministry special forces bringing old people from villages , basically emptying the villages on the south ossetian side and dumping them in gori , " he told reuters . no agreement at security council russia late thursday submitted a formal text to the un security council aimed at ending the conflict in georgia , but the united states and britain said they were not ready to vote for it . the 15-nation council also had a second draft resolution for consideration from france , the current president of the european union , which called for the immediate and definite withdrawal of russian troops from georgia , including south ossetia and abkhazia , a cease-fire and international negotiations to settle the issues between georgia and russia . british ambassador john sawers told reporters following a two-hour closed-door discussion by the council that the body was not ready to adopt either the russian or the french draft because of the unsettled conditions on the ground in georgia . " we do need to see real progress on the ground , " sawers said referring to demands for russia to pull out of georgia . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the harsh penalty has drawn hefty criticism , particularly from washington . florian norbu gyanatshang , a 30-year-old tibetan-german from stuttgart , was among those being held in beijing .
head of the german chapter of the tibetan youth association in europe , the software developer was arrested on thursday , aug .
21 , for unfurling a tibetan flag near the olympic stadium in the chinese capital . " as a german citizen , i can not remain silent at the blatant human rights violations that are occurring in tibet , " he said in a statement published in germany after his arrest .
" and as a tibetan , i would like to stand by my fellow countrymen in this difficult situation . " two americans and one briton were arrested with gyanatshang for disturbing the " public order . "
chinese police said on friday that they had detained another six us activists for 10 days . ten-day detention is the harshest treatment so far of tibet activists since a series of demonstrations in the capital during the olympics .
chinese law allows police to force people to undergo administrative detention without trial .
dozens of other protesters have been deported shortly after their arrest during the games . us urges human rights standards the six americans most recently detained were believed to be from the us-based group students for a free tibet , which had held eight pro-tibet protests in beijing since aug .
6 . " these people of conscience from many walks of life were here to make sure the tibetan issue was at the forefront during these olympics games , " kate woznow , the group 's campaign director , told dpa news agency . a spokeswoman for the us embassy in beijing told dpa that the embassy was aware of the detainments , but she could not provide details due to privacy concerns . " we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights , including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond , " said spokeswoman susan stevenson . " these rights are protected by china 's own constitution and international human rights standards to which china has agreed . " when asked about the detentions and other human rights issues , chinese olympic organizing committee vice-president wang wie said western media were showing a bias against china and lack of knowledge about the country at a press conference on friday . " history will show that awarding the games to china was the correct decision , " he told reporters , adding that they should " write the truth .

the harsh penalty has drawn hefty criticism , particularly from washington . florian norbu gyanatshang , a 30-year-old tibetan-german from stuttgart , was among those being held in beijing .
head of the german chapter of the tibetan youth association in europe , the software developer was arrested on thursday , aug .
21 , for unfurling a tibetan flag near the olympic stadium in the chinese capital . " as a german citizen , i can not remain silent at the blatant human rights violations that are occurring in tibet , " he said in a statement published in germany after his arrest .
" and as a tibetan , i would like to stand by my fellow countrymen in this difficult situation . " two americans and one briton were arrested with gyanatshang for disturbing the " public order . "
chinese police said on friday that they had detained another six us activists for 10 days . ten-day detention is the harshest treatment so far of tibet activists since a series of demonstrations in the capital during the olympics .
chinese law allows police to force people to undergo administrative detention without trial .
dozens of other protesters have been deported shortly after their arrest during the games . us urges human rights standards the six americans most recently detained were believed to be from the us-based group students for a free tibet , which had held eight pro-tibet protests in beijing since aug .

" we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights , including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond , " said spokeswoman susan stevenson . " these rights are protected by china 's own constitution and international human rights standards to which china has agreed . " when asked about the detentions and other human rights issues , chinese olympic organizing committee vice-president wang wie said western media were showing a bias against china and lack of knowledge about the country at a press conference on friday . " history will show that awarding the games to china was the correct decision , " he told reporters , adding that they should " write the truth .

in total , baa runs seven british airports . the final decision over the future of the airports would be taken in april , said the commission , which had found that the undivided ownership of britain 's leading airports was having " adverse consequences " on air traffic for passengers and airlines . reacting to the report , baa chief colin matthews insisted the company would not sell heathrow , yet he conceded the watchdog 's findings on " poor service " and " frustration " for passengers . german firm watching baa situation in germany , essen-based company hochtief said it continued to have a " great interest " in gatwick , the uk 's second-largest airport . hochtief is germany 's largest construction company with subsidiaries in the us and australia . however , it remained unclear at this time when and under which conditions the company would get involved , a company spokeswoman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baa-owned stansted airport may be up for sale in the near future she said the company would also be interested in other baa airports should they become available .

the report especially blamed the company for slow responses to passenger concerns and the failure to expand its airports ' capacities . the company reacted by accusing the competition watchdog of errors in judgment and said an airport sale would be counterproductive . airlines including ryanair , virgin atlantic airways and easyjet welcomed the commission 's findings . british airport operator manchester airport group also expressed interest in one of the three london hubs , which process 90 percent of all air traffic into london . the group , which operates airports in manchester , bournemouth , east midlands and humberside , said it was considering " one or more " baa airports . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his widow , helga , said that vogel had not been well after suffering a heart attack earlier in this year . the former lawyer was best known for his work as a german to german negotiator .
while working for the government of east germany , he made the transfer of over 250,000 people out of the gdr possible .
vogel also arranged the exchange of almost 34,000 political prisoners between the east and west . during the height of the cold war in the late 50s , vogel was the only point man between the west german government in bonn and the communist gdr in east berlin .
at the time both sides claimed to have no official contact . negotiating for super powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vogel oversaw the exchange of kgb spy abel and american pilot powers vogel gained a sense of acclaim , if not notoriety , for overseeing the exchange of kgb spy rudolf j. abel for gary powers in 1962 .

vogel 's reach inside the east german government was so extensive that when former chancellor helmut schmidt wanted to visit the country , it was vogel who helped arrange it .
schmidt later dubbed vogel “ our mail man ” .
after the fall of the berlin wall , vogel admitted that he also worked for the stasi , east germany ’ s secret police .
he was accused of blackmailing people who wanted to leave the gdr , and for selling real estate at well below market value .
however , in 1998 he was cleared of those charges by the german federal supreme court . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years . the year was 1977 shortly after the death of mao , and i had gotten a special visa reserved for young “ overseas chinese ” to visit the motherland .
back then china was an impoverished police state that had just emerged from the political chaos and violence of the cultural revolution , a misnomer for a movement that destroyed any shred of culture whatsoever .
i could n't even utter the name mao in public except to glorify him , let alone criticize the chinese government .
my visa was restricted to the one city where some cousins still lived - shanghai , which many chinese call the berlin of the east for its dazzle , sophistication , progressive politics and historical baggage . striking uniformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's portrait remains , but his ideology is gone i could n't walk down the streets wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt without being interrogated by the neighborhood watchdogs about my western apparel .
everyone wore shapeless uniform jackets and baggy trousers in faded green , blue or grey . there was hardly a single western face on the streets in this most cosmopolitan of all chinese cities .
if a fair-haired , blue-eyed foreigner appeared in public , he was swarmed by a crowd of onlookers .
there were few businessmen and diplomats , no tourists and no accredited journalists in china .
physical movement was restricted by lack of transport .
there were a few city trams , no cars or subways and if anyone tried to bike outside the city limits , the " border police " were ever present .
but at least the chinese had clean air . omnipresence of the state if you were an ordinary chinese citizen , the state regulated every aspect of your life down to whether you were practicing birth control to make sure you adhered to the restrictive one-child only family policy . you could forget about choosing your own line of work or place of residence - the state assigned you a job and living quarters .
and if you wanted to get married , you needed a stamp of approval from your work unit , which had to ensure that the future spouse was " politically clean . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dress codes were more relaxed for children than adults if you were labeled a " capitalist roader " artist or intellectual , you were sent to the countryside to be " re-educated , " meaning you were tortured and persecuted .
even if you managed to come out physically alive , your spirit was broken .
this was the china that my side of the family had the luck to escape .
rejecting the chairman 's wife today 's china bears no resemblance to the big brother nation i once knew .
that does n't mean that china still does n't have a long way to go in terms of human rights and press freedoms as the beijing olympics have demonstrated , but the people 's republic has also come a very , very long way in just one generation .
china has even advanced so much economically and politically now that it has become a country my family would not have fled at the time of the communist takeover in 1949 .
my grandfather had been a shanghai industrialist who made a fortune as the chinese agent for ig farben , the pre-war amalgam of germany 's basf , bayer and hoechst today .
being a bourgeois capitalist was bad enough for the communists .
even worse , he had also produced movies , in which a two-bit actress named jiang qing was rejected for a plum role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist with german business ties could n't survive mao jiang was to later become madame mao and used her tremendous power as the chairman 's wife to exact ruthless revenge on those who had slighted her .
when it became clear that the nationalist chinese government was doomed in 1948 , shanghai 's business elite , including grandpa , knew they could n't survive under mao , so they had escaped to british hong kong before china 's borders were sealed for the next thirty years . " hong kong will take over china ! " by the 1970s , the combination of british governance and a laissez-faire economy enabled the chinese from the mainland to turn hong kong into one of asia 's four industrial tigers along with singapore , south korea and taiwan , where the nationalists had fled .
china , meanwhile , had been in the throes of the cultural revolution .
then mao died and jiang qing was purged from the party , ending an era of totalitarian communist rule and political isolation .
after a power struggle between the hardliners and pragmatists , china 's reformist leader deng xiao ping emerged in 1979 with his famous adage , " it does n't matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice . "
revolutionary ideology was out , go-go capitalism was in , and the economic advances in the last decades that have been on display during the olympics , have been breathtaking .
but along with higher living standards and double-digit growth , came greed , official corruption and environmental degradation .
why bother to ride a bike when you can drive a bmw ? bildunterschrift : the oriental pearl tv tower is a symbol of shanghai 's building boom and modernity in 1997 , the british lease on hong kong island had expired and the former crown colony was turned over to china .
when i expressed concern about the changeover , a close family friend who had been a communist official retorted , " you think mighty china is going to swallow tiny hong kong ?
balderdash !
it 's hong kong that will take over china ! "
he was right .
my german-born , teenage daughter was in shanghai earlier this year .
i asked her how it was . " i was in the oriental pearl tower , the jewish refugee museum , the shanghai cathedral , the -lrb- famous waterfront -rrb- bund ... and starbucks ! " she said , showing me photos of ultra-modern gleaming skyscrapers that outshone even hong kong . two steps forward , one step back political reform has n't kept pace with economic growth though .
the same official explained that the process of political liberalization is not a straight trajectory . " china takes two steps forward and one step back , but still moves forward , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks were able to openly worship starting the 1980s in the 1980s many temples , churches and mosques that had been smashed during the cultural revolution had been restored and religion was tolerated as long as it was kept a private matter .
china opened up to mass tourism , but kept foreign visitors on a leash .
chinese dissenters were able to come out in the open and criticize the party and its policies , but then the pro-democracy movement at tiananmen square was brutally crushed in 1989 . journalists can now travel in more remote regions than ever before , but during the games their movements are restricted in the name of national security . there are now more internet users in china than anywhere on earth , a by product of globalization .
then china 's politicos tried to control the flow of information by blocking " sensitive " news web sites , including deutsche welle 's , right before the games but a media furor convinced them to change their minds . the chinese leadership quietly indicated they are prepared to invite the dalai lama to china for talks , according to the new york times .
if tibet 's exiled spiritual leader actually sets foot on chinese soil for the first time in nearly 50 years , this would be a big step forward . and so it goes .
a political opening that goes too far and the brakes are slammed with china going into reverse gear .
two steps forward and one step back .

but the next us president will have to repair ties with russia . in a rare show of solidarity with the republican incumbent , democratic presidential hopeful obama said on thursday , aug .
21 , that he agreed with president george w. bush 's stance toward russia following the recent five-day conflict with georgia . " i 'm supportive of what george bush has been doing , " said obama , who disagrees with bush on most foreign policy issues .
" there will be a time later for politics .
i 'm a big believer that when you 're in a crisis , america speaks with one voice . " bush , who has nurtured positive personal relations with russian prime minister vladimir putin over the past eight years , has firmly denounced russia 's decision to send troops into georgia after the former soviet republic attacked the separatist region of south ossetia on aug .
8 . while the west has largely condemned russia 's military involvement in georgia , russia has sharply criticized georgia for attacking its breakaway provinces . new chapter in us-russia relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama agrees with bush - at least as far as the caucasus war is concerned the us president has insisted that georgia 's territorial sovereignty be respected .
the pro-russian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia have enjoyed de facto independence from georgia since the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 . nevertheless , the clash with russia has put the chill on us-russian relations . the conflict in the caucasus " indicates a new stage in the relationship between russia and the west , " said obama thursday .
" we 've got to be firm with the russians , in alliance with our european allies , that this kind of behavior is intolerable . " both obama and republican presidential hopeful john mccain have warned russia of severe , long-term consequences from its conflict with georgia . the united states is caught somewhat between a rock and a hard place as it is dependent on russia 's approval in the united nations security council , where moscow enjoys veto power , on a number of international issues . georgia becomes presidential battlefield mccain , who is slightly behind obama in polls , has used the russian-georgian conflict to draw attention to his extensive foreign policy experience .
a vietnam veteran , former prisoner of war , and long-time us senator , mccain has said he is better suited than his significantly younger opponent to take on the position of commander-in-chief . obama , a first-term senator from illinois with no military experience , recently made a highly publicized tour of europe in an effort to boost his image on the foreign policy front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain , seen here with us troops in iraq , said his military experience better qualifies him mccain has gone beyond the white house 's stance in his response to russia in light of the fighting in georgia , demanding that russia be expelled from the group of eight highly industrialized nations , at least for a time .
he has also expressed opposition to russian membership in the world trade organization . " in matters of national security , good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president - as we were all reminded ... by the events in the nation of georgia , " said mccain earlier this week . advice from all sides obama promised thursday , addressing supporters in virginia , to call on the " best and brightest " foreign policy advisors , should he be elected . " and by the way , they do n't have to be democrats , " he said , naming republican richard lugar , who is chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , among others . as far as foreign policy matters are concerned , mccain and obama differ most notably in their approach to the war in iraq , which is largely unpopular in europe . obama has pledged to withdraw nearly all us troops from iraq within 16 months , while mccain has promised to remain until victory . addressing us foreign policy as a whole on thursday , obama conceded , however , that " there are times when we are going to have to use military force .

my visa was restricted to the one city where some cousins still lived - shanghai , which many chinese call the berlin of the east for its dazzle , sophistication , progressive politics and historical baggage . striking uniformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's portrait remains , but his ideology is gone i could n't walk down the streets wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt without being interrogated by the neighborhood watchdogs about my western apparel .
everyone wore shapeless uniform jackets and baggy trousers in faded green , blue or grey . there was hardly a single western face on the streets in this most cosmopolitan of all chinese cities .
if a fair-haired , blue-eyed foreigner appeared in public , he was swarmed by a crowd of onlookers .
there were few businessmen and diplomats , no tourists and no accredited journalists in china .
physical movement was restricted by lack of transport .
there were a few city trams , no cars or subways and if anyone tried to bike outside the city limits , the " border police " were ever present .
but at least the chinese had clean air . omnipresence of the state if you were an ordinary chinese citizen , the state regulated every aspect of your life down to whether you were practicing birth control to make sure you adhered to the restrictive one-child only family policy . you could forget about choosing your own line of work or place of residence - the state assigned you a job and living quarters .
and if you wanted to get married , you needed a stamp of approval from your work unit , which had to ensure that the future spouse was " politically clean . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dress codes were more relaxed for children than adults if you were labeled a " capitalist roader " artist or intellectual , you were sent to the countryside to be " re-educated , " meaning you were tortured and persecuted .
even if you managed to come out physically alive , your spirit was broken .
this was the china that my side of the family had the luck to escape .
rejecting the chairman 's wife today 's china bears no resemblance to the big brother nation i once knew .
that does n't mean that china still does n't have a long way to go in terms of human rights and press freedoms as the beijing olympics have demonstrated , but the people 's republic has also come a very , very long way in just one generation .
china has even advanced so much economically and politically now that it has become a country my family would not have fled at the time of the communist takeover in 1949 .
my grandfather had been a shanghai industrialist who made a fortune as the chinese agent for ig farben , the pre-war amalgam of germany 's basf , bayer and hoechst today .
being a bourgeois capitalist was bad enough for the communists .
even worse , he had also produced movies , in which a two-bit actress named jiang qing was rejected for a plum role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist with german business ties could n't survive mao jiang was to later become madame mao and used her tremendous power as the chairman 's wife to exact ruthless revenge on those who had slighted her .
when it became clear that the nationalist chinese government was doomed in 1948 , shanghai 's business elite , including grandpa , knew they could n't survive under mao , so they had escaped to british hong kong before china 's borders were sealed for the next thirty years . " hong kong will take over china ! " by the 1970s , the combination of british governance and a laissez-faire economy enabled the chinese from the mainland to turn hong kong into one of asia 's four industrial tigers along with singapore , south korea and taiwan , where the nationalists had fled .
china , meanwhile , had been in the throes of the cultural revolution .
then mao died and jiang qing was purged from the party , ending an era of totalitarian communist rule and political isolation .
after a power struggle between the hardliners and pragmatists , china 's reformist leader deng xiao ping emerged in 1979 with his famous adage , " it does n't matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice . "
revolutionary ideology was out , go-go capitalism was in , and the economic advances in the last decades that have been on display during the olympics , have been breathtaking .
but along with higher living standards and double-digit growth , came greed , official corruption and environmental degradation .
why bother to ride a bike when you can drive a bmw ? bildunterschrift : the oriental pearl tv tower is a symbol of shanghai 's building boom and modernity in 1997 , the british lease on hong kong island had expired and the former crown colony was turned over to china .
when i expressed concern about the changeover , a close family friend who had been a communist official retorted , " you think mighty china is going to swallow tiny hong kong ?
balderdash !
it 's hong kong that will take over china ! "
he was right .
my german-born , teenage daughter was in shanghai earlier this year .
i asked her how it was . " i was in the oriental pearl tower , the jewish refugee museum , the shanghai cathedral , the -lrb- famous waterfront -rrb- bund ... and starbucks ! " she said , showing me photos of ultra-modern gleaming skyscrapers that outshone even hong kong . two steps forward , one step back political reform has n't kept pace with economic growth though .
the same official explained that the process of political liberalization is not a straight trajectory . " china takes two steps forward and one step back , but still moves forward , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks were able to openly worship starting the 1980s in the 1980s many temples , churches and mosques that had been smashed during the cultural revolution had been restored and religion was tolerated as long as it was kept a private matter .
china opened up to mass tourism , but kept foreign visitors on a leash .
chinese dissenters were able to come out in the open and criticize the party and its policies , but then the pro-democracy movement at tiananmen square was brutally crushed in 1989 . journalists can now travel in more remote regions than ever before , but during the games their movements are restricted in the name of national security . there are now more internet users in china than anywhere on earth , a by product of globalization .
then china 's politicos tried to control the flow of information by blocking " sensitive " news web sites , including deutsche welle 's , right before the games but a media furor convinced them to change their minds . the chinese leadership quietly indicated they are prepared to invite the dalai lama to china for talks , according to the new york times .
if tibet 's exiled spiritual leader actually sets foot on chinese soil for the first time in nearly 50 years , this would be a big step forward . and so it goes .
a political opening that goes too far and the brakes are slammed with china going into reverse gear .
two steps forward and one step back .

dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years . the year was 1977 shortly after the death of mao , and i had gotten a special visa reserved for young “ overseas chinese ” to visit the motherland .
back then china was an impoverished police state that had just emerged from the political chaos and violence of the cultural revolution , a misnomer for a movement that destroyed any shred of culture whatsoever .

troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .
however , in the interview with german public broadcaster ard on friday , he added that moscow 's use of force in georgia was " fully disproportionate " to the severity of the situation . buffer zone a point of contention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian president has rejected the idea of a buffer zone russian president dmitry medvedev has promised that all but 500 russian troops would be withdrawn from georgia by then . moscow said those remaining troops would be stationed in what it termed as " zone of responsibility " as part of a peacekeeping operation to protect south ossetia .
this would leave russian troops present inside the georgian heartland and close to its economically vital east-west highway .
boldryev made no reference those 500 troops in his remarks . georgian president mikhail saakashvili has said he would not stand for their presence . " there will be no buffer zones , " he told reuters news agency in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
" we will never live with any buffer zones .
we 'll never allow anything like this . " osce observers due monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee camp for georgians from south ossetia and gori meanwhile , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has announced that twenty of its observers will be ready to start monitoring a ceasefire between georgia and russia from monday . " by monday most of the equipment will be in place - especially the armored vehicles - we will have our staff here , we will have our operational center set up and we can start sending out monitors into various parts in georgia and neighboring south ossetia , " said alexander stubb , the pan-european security organization 's chairman . his comments came while visiting a refugee camp on the outskirts of tbilisi .
he had earlier traveled through russian-controlled checkpoints to the city of gori where russian troops were still present , deep inside georgia . stubb , who is also the finnish foreign minister , said he had witnessed " atrocious sights . " " there are russian interior ministry special forces bringing old people from villages , basically emptying the villages on the south ossetian side and dumping them in gori , " he told reuters . no agreement at security council russia late thursday submitted a formal text to the un security council aimed at ending the conflict in georgia , but the united states and britain said they were not ready to vote for it . the 15-nation council also had a second draft resolution for consideration from france , the current president of the european union , which called for the immediate and definite withdrawal of russian troops from georgia , including south ossetia and abkhazia , a cease-fire and international negotiations to settle the issues between georgia and russia . british ambassador john sawers told reporters following a two-hour closed-door discussion by the council that the body was not ready to adopt either the russian or the french draft because of the unsettled conditions on the ground in georgia . " we do need to see real progress on the ground , " sawers said referring to demands for russia to pull out of georgia . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 22.08.2008 russia : 10 days needed for georgia pullout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians are now said to be pulling out of gori russia promised to withdraw most forces from deep inside georgia , but was set to retain a military presence in two separatist regions and a buffer zone .
troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .
however , in the interview with german public broadcaster ard on friday , he added that moscow 's use of force in georgia was " fully disproportionate " to the severity of the situation . buffer zone a point of contention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian president has rejected the idea of a buffer zone russian president dmitry medvedev has promised that all but 500 russian troops would be withdrawn from georgia by then . moscow said those remaining troops would be stationed in what it termed as " zone of responsibility " as part of a peacekeeping operation to protect south ossetia .
this would leave russian troops present inside the georgian heartland and close to its economically vital east-west highway .
boldryev made no reference those 500 troops in his remarks . georgian president mikhail saakashvili has said he would not stand for their presence . " there will be no buffer zones , " he told reuters news agency in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
" we will never live with any buffer zones .
we 'll never allow anything like this . " osce observers due monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee camp for georgians from south ossetia and gori meanwhile , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has announced that twenty of its observers will be ready to start monitoring a ceasefire between georgia and russia from monday . " by monday most of the equipment will be in place - especially the armored vehicles - we will have our staff here , we will have our operational center set up and we can start sending out monitors into various parts in georgia and neighboring south ossetia , " said alexander stubb , the pan-european security organization 's chairman . his comments came while visiting a refugee camp on the outskirts of tbilisi .
he had earlier traveled through russian-controlled checkpoints to the city of gori where russian troops were still present , deep inside georgia . stubb , who is also the finnish foreign minister , said he had witnessed " atrocious sights . " " there are russian interior ministry special forces bringing old people from villages , basically emptying the villages on the south ossetian side and dumping them in gori , " he told reuters . no agreement at security council russia late thursday submitted a formal text to the un security council aimed at ending the conflict in georgia , but the united states and britain said they were not ready to vote for it . the 15-nation council also had a second draft resolution for consideration from france , the current president of the european union , which called for the immediate and definite withdrawal of russian troops from georgia , including south ossetia and abkhazia , a cease-fire and international negotiations to settle the issues between georgia and russia . british ambassador john sawers told reporters following a two-hour closed-door discussion by the council that the body was not ready to adopt either the russian or the french draft because of the unsettled conditions on the ground in georgia . " we do need to see real progress on the ground , " sawers said referring to demands for russia to pull out of georgia . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and though they 're too young to remember the cold war , they still feel the old grievances . mariam sits in the main garden outside the university in bonn , germany .
it 's a warm august evening and the sun has just set .
mariam does n't notice .
she is too caught up in the thoughts running through her mind .
mariam , a university student , says she is afraid every day .
afraid for her family and her country . " each day i call my mother in tbilisi and if she does n't answer i am totally overcome by fear .
i 'm convinced that a russian bomb landed on our house , " she says . rage towards russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariam fears for her family 's safety for the past four years mariam has lived in germany , studying economics .
she would like to return to her homeland , but at the moment she does n't dare .
she and her georgian friends follow the unrest in her native country on the television and the internet . mariam and her sister , mtvarisa , are furious with russia and the russian president .
mtvarisa says that russia just can not deal with the fact that georgia is developing in a western fashion . georgia has a very strategic position .
gas and oil pipelines pass through our country , and of course the russians want to control them , she adds . " we have to defend ourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers are out in full force against the russians nino also firmly believes in her country and the georgian president .
she finds saakashvili 's actions commendable .
" we have to defend ourselves , " she says .
it sounds like something memorized at a young age .
nino has been in germany for a year , and is waiting for a spot to open up for her to study medicine . she has just turned 20 .
she never experienced the cold war .
nevertheless , even she feels some of the old hatred when she sees the former frontlines re-outlined : east against west , russia against america - and georgia in the middle , sitting on the fence .
georgia is like a buffer state with an overpowering adversary standing at the door . enemies at the disco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nino completely supports her government for the young georgians , a russian is someone to hate , not to have as a friend .
that 's how it 's always been .
because of that , nino could never imagine herself falling in love with a russian boy , not even here in germany . " after everything that has happened between our countries , it is n't possible anymore , " she says defensively , shaking her head . the young georgian has brought this hate , anger and fear with her to germany .
luckily there are n't any russians living in her dormitory , she says .
though she came across a few in the street one evening recently .
a couple of russian students who were looking for a disco asked nino and mariam if they knew where one was . mariam recognized the accent immediately .
when she and nino told the russians where they were from , the mood darkened , she explains . " and when they asked where we were from , and we told them that we 're georgians , they became aggressive .
one boy screamed : ' russia will kill georgia ' .
i said , you are our enemies , but we will gladly help you find a disco , " she says . " there is no peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian soldiers have still not withdrawn from the country the only solution is for the russians to leave , agree the two students .
they are afraid that russia will simply annex georgia and remove the government . " i could never live under a russian government , " says mariam .
" i am georgian and proud of it . " " there is no peace , " says nino , " the war is over , but the people are still afraid of the russians .
they are still in georgia and refuse to leave .

i 'm a big believer that when you 're in a crisis , america speaks with one voice .

" both obama and republican presidential hopeful john mccain have warned russia of severe , long-term consequences from its conflict with georgia . the united states is caught somewhat between a rock and a hard place as it is dependent on russia 's approval in the united nations security council , where moscow enjoys veto power , on a number of international issues . georgia becomes presidential battlefield mccain , who is slightly behind obama in polls , has used the russian-georgian conflict to draw attention to his extensive foreign policy experience .
a vietnam veteran , former prisoner of war , and long-time us senator , mccain has said he is better suited than his significantly younger opponent to take on the position of commander-in-chief . obama , a first-term senator from illinois with no military experience , recently made a highly publicized tour of europe in an effort to boost his image on the foreign policy front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain , seen here with us troops in iraq , said his military experience better qualifies him mccain has gone beyond the white house 's stance in his response to russia in light of the fighting in georgia , demanding that russia be expelled from the group of eight highly industrialized nations , at least for a time .
he has also expressed opposition to russian membership in the world trade organization . " in matters of national security , good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president - as we were all reminded ... by the events in the nation of georgia , " said mccain earlier this week . advice from all sides obama promised thursday , addressing supporters in virginia , to call on the " best and brightest " foreign policy advisors , should he be elected . " and by the way , they do n't have to be democrats , " he said , naming republican richard lugar , who is chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , among others . as far as foreign policy matters are concerned , mccain and obama differ most notably in their approach to the war in iraq , which is largely unpopular in europe . obama has pledged to withdraw nearly all us troops from iraq within 16 months , while mccain has promised to remain until victory . addressing us foreign policy as a whole on thursday , obama conceded , however , that " there are times when we are going to have to use military force .

22 but were still operating checkpoints despite pledges to leave by the end of the day .
columns were reportedly headed for south ossetia and abkhazia . as the united nations again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict , russia finally began to withdraw , in line with a french-brokered plan , from the strongly pro-western ex-soviet republic .
the russian general staff said that troops were " in the final stage of pulling back , " but they would continue to hold buffer zones and maintain peacekeeping forces in the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .
the united states has criticized the planned buffer zone as a half-way measure that fails to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
russian armored columns were moving north from the central gori sector in south ossetia , but a defensive cordon remained in place with checkpoints outside gori and near the georgian village of igoeti .
troops heading for south ossetia and abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west and georgia say russia is dragging its heels twenty russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops were seen heading north from near the georgian city of gori toward the separatist region of south ossetia , reporters said .
the nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armored personnel carriers headed towards the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian troopers driving northward on the gori-tskhinvali road shouted " russia ! " and " we 're going home ! "
but reconnaissance , tank , and infantry peacekeepers operating checkpoints in the vicinity said they had not received orders to evacuate .
russian infantry were continuing to dig in on high ground overlooking a river bridge near igoeti .
fuel tankers were refueling tanks and armored personnel carriers , and supply lorries were delivering food and water to russian troops .
the russian military said 18 additional russian checkpoints were being set up as part of russian-controlled buffer zones along the borders between central georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia respectively .
a contingent of 2,142 russian peacekeeping forces would remain in abkhazia and 452 troops in south ossetia , colonel general nogovitsyn said .
russian forces would be out of georgia proper by 20:00 local time , he said .
criticism continues over delay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columns of troops are heading for the rebel regions aleksander lomia , georgia 's national security council head , in mid-afternoon gave tbilisi 's first official acknowledgement of the russian withdrawal , saying russian forces " were pulling out , but not fast enough , " according to an interfax report .
international criticism has mounted that moscow is delaying withdrawing its troops from georgian territory in accordance with a ceasefire that ended the 10-day conflict .
us president george w bush called for an end to the russian " siege " in a telephone conversation on thursday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , a us ally .
but russian military commanders brushed aside bush 's demands , saying they were complying with the peace accord .
" the president of the united states is on vacation .
obviously , he is not receiving timely information .
we recommend the president 's press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences , " nogovitsyn said .
russians manning checkpoints along the tbilisi-gori road were permitting civilian and humanitarian traffic to pass , but were blocking " unscheduled " diplomats and media .
a russian national flag flew over the gori checkpoint .
georgia 's western region also saw substantial russian withdrawals on friday , with amour and infantry abandoning georgian government buildings in the centre of zugdidi , a town near the border with abkhazia , the georgian secessionist province loyal to moscow .
the western town of senaki , site of georgia 's largest air base , and the port of poti , on the black sea coast , had seen no reductions in russian occupation forces by early afternoon on friday .
russian forces rolled into georgia on august 8 to push back a georgian offensive to re-take control of its rebel south ossetia region , which won de facto autonomy in a civil war in the early 1990s .
russian troops also moved forward in georgia 's other breakaway region of abkhazia , and seized key strategic bases in georgia , including poti .

over 1,000 people attended a similar rally in south ossetia 's main town and on friday , the south ossetia parliament formally asked russia to recognize its independence , ria novosti news agency reported .
moscow has hinted at giving both recognition in a move that would risk sparking one of the deepest crises between russia and the west since the cold war .

the russian general staff said that troops were " in the final stage of pulling back , " but they would continue to hold buffer zones and maintain peacekeeping forces in the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .

22 but were still operating checkpoints despite pledges to leave by the end of the day .
columns were reportedly headed for south ossetia and abkhazia . as the united nations again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict , russia finally began to withdraw , in line with a french-brokered plan , from the strongly pro-western ex-soviet republic .
the russian general staff said that troops were " in the final stage of pulling back , " but they would continue to hold buffer zones and maintain peacekeeping forces in the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .
the united states has criticized the planned buffer zone as a half-way measure that fails to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
russian armored columns were moving north from the central gori sector in south ossetia , but a defensive cordon remained in place with checkpoints outside gori and near the georgian village of igoeti .
troops heading for south ossetia and abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west and georgia say russia is dragging its heels twenty russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops were seen heading north from near the georgian city of gori toward the separatist region of south ossetia , reporters said .
the nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armored personnel carriers headed towards the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian troopers driving northward on the gori-tskhinvali road shouted " russia ! " and " we 're going home ! "
but reconnaissance , tank , and infantry peacekeepers operating checkpoints in the vicinity said they had not received orders to evacuate .
russian infantry were continuing to dig in on high ground overlooking a river bridge near igoeti .
fuel tankers were refueling tanks and armored personnel carriers , and supply lorries were delivering food and water to russian troops .
the russian military said 18 additional russian checkpoints were being set up as part of russian-controlled buffer zones along the borders between central georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia respectively .
a contingent of 2,142 russian peacekeeping forces would remain in abkhazia and 452 troops in south ossetia , colonel general nogovitsyn said .
russian forces would be out of georgia proper by 20:00 local time , he said .
criticism continues over delay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columns of troops are heading for the rebel regions aleksander lomia , georgia 's national security council head , in mid-afternoon gave tbilisi 's first official acknowledgement of the russian withdrawal , saying russian forces " were pulling out , but not fast enough , " according to an interfax report .
international criticism has mounted that moscow is delaying withdrawing its troops from georgian territory in accordance with a ceasefire that ended the 10-day conflict .
us president george w bush called for an end to the russian " siege " in a telephone conversation on thursday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , a us ally .
but russian military commanders brushed aside bush 's demands , saying they were complying with the peace accord .
" the president of the united states is on vacation .
obviously , he is not receiving timely information .
we recommend the president 's press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences , " nogovitsyn said .
russians manning checkpoints along the tbilisi-gori road were permitting civilian and humanitarian traffic to pass , but were blocking " unscheduled " diplomats and media .
a russian national flag flew over the gori checkpoint .
georgia 's western region also saw substantial russian withdrawals on friday , with amour and infantry abandoning georgian government buildings in the centre of zugdidi , a town near the border with abkhazia , the georgian secessionist province loyal to moscow .
the western town of senaki , site of georgia 's largest air base , and the port of poti , on the black sea coast , had seen no reductions in russian occupation forces by early afternoon on friday .
russian forces rolled into georgia on august 8 to push back a georgian offensive to re-take control of its rebel south ossetia region , which won de facto autonomy in a civil war in the early 1990s .
russian troops also moved forward in georgia 's other breakaway region of abkhazia , and seized key strategic bases in georgia , including poti .

on thursday , tens of thousands gathered in sukhumi , capital of abkhazia , to demand russian recognition of their independence .
over 1,000 people attended a similar rally in south ossetia 's main town and on friday , the south ossetia parliament formally asked russia to recognize its independence , ria novosti news agency reported .
moscow has hinted at giving both recognition in a move that would risk sparking one of the deepest crises between russia and the west since the cold war .
russia 's two houses of parliament are to discuss the issue monday .
the kremlin has suggested that kosovo serve as a precedent in international law for recognizing the two rebel regions ' bid for independence . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 22.08.2008 russia : 10 days needed for georgia pullout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians are now said to be pulling out of gori russia promised to withdraw most forces from deep inside georgia , but was set to retain a military presence in two separatist regions and a buffer zone .
troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .

troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .
however , in the interview with german public broadcaster ard on friday , he added that moscow 's use of force in georgia was " fully disproportionate " to the severity of the situation . buffer zone a point of contention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian president has rejected the idea of a buffer zone russian president dmitry medvedev has promised that all but 500 russian troops would be withdrawn from georgia by then . moscow said those remaining troops would be stationed in what it termed as " zone of responsibility " as part of a peacekeeping operation to protect south ossetia .

his widow , helga , said that vogel had not been well after suffering a heart attack earlier in this year . the former lawyer was best known for his work as a german to german negotiator .
while working for the government of east germany , he made the transfer of over 250,000 people out of the gdr possible .
vogel also arranged the exchange of almost 34,000 political prisoners between the east and west . during the height of the cold war in the late 50s , vogel was the only point man between the west german government in bonn and the communist gdr in east berlin .
at the time both sides claimed to have no official contact . negotiating for super powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vogel oversaw the exchange of kgb spy abel and american pilot powers vogel gained a sense of acclaim , if not notoriety , for overseeing the exchange of kgb spy rudolf j. abel for gary powers in 1962 .
powers was an american pilot shot down over the ussr while flying his u-2 spy plane in 1960 . he also oversaw the exchange of others involved in espionage or imprisoned in east germany in exchange for those held in the west , including jewish dissident anatoly scharansky , who spent nearly nine years in soviet captivity on espionage charges .
in another case , in 1985 , 23 people held by east germany on espionage charges were exchanged for four agents of the german democratic republic convicted by the u.s. the mailman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schmidt once called vogel ' our mail man ' all the deals were staged on the glienicker bridge between potsdam and west berlin .
ironically , at the time , the span was known as the ‘ bridge of unity ’ , even though it only served the allies as a border crossing .
vogel 's reach inside the east german government was so extensive that when former chancellor helmut schmidt wanted to visit the country , it was vogel who helped arrange it .
schmidt later dubbed vogel “ our mail man ” .
after the fall of the berlin wall , vogel admitted that he also worked for the stasi , east germany ’ s secret police .
he was accused of blackmailing people who wanted to leave the gdr , and for selling real estate at well below market value .
however , in 1998 he was cleared of those charges by the german federal supreme court . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

vogel 's reach inside the east german government was so extensive that when former chancellor helmut schmidt wanted to visit the country , it was vogel who helped arrange it .
schmidt later dubbed vogel “ our mail man ” .
after the fall of the berlin wall , vogel admitted that he also worked for the stasi , east germany ’ s secret police .
he was accused of blackmailing people who wanted to leave the gdr , and for selling real estate at well below market value .
however , in 1998 he was cleared of those charges by the german federal supreme court . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years . the year was 1977 shortly after the death of mao , and i had gotten a special visa reserved for young “ overseas chinese ” to visit the motherland .
back then china was an impoverished police state that had just emerged from the political chaos and violence of the cultural revolution , a misnomer for a movement that destroyed any shred of culture whatsoever .
i could n't even utter the name mao in public except to glorify him , let alone criticize the chinese government .
my visa was restricted to the one city where some cousins still lived - shanghai , which many chinese call the berlin of the east for its dazzle , sophistication , progressive politics and historical baggage . striking uniformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's portrait remains , but his ideology is gone i could n't walk down the streets wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt without being interrogated by the neighborhood watchdogs about my western apparel .
everyone wore shapeless uniform jackets and baggy trousers in faded green , blue or grey . there was hardly a single western face on the streets in this most cosmopolitan of all chinese cities .
if a fair-haired , blue-eyed foreigner appeared in public , he was swarmed by a crowd of onlookers .
there were few businessmen and diplomats , no tourists and no accredited journalists in china .
physical movement was restricted by lack of transport .
there were a few city trams , no cars or subways and if anyone tried to bike outside the city limits , the " border police " were ever present .
but at least the chinese had clean air . omnipresence of the state if you were an ordinary chinese citizen , the state regulated every aspect of your life down to whether you were practicing birth control to make sure you adhered to the restrictive one-child only family policy . you could forget about choosing your own line of work or place of residence - the state assigned you a job and living quarters .
and if you wanted to get married , you needed a stamp of approval from your work unit , which had to ensure that the future spouse was " politically clean . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dress codes were more relaxed for children than adults if you were labeled a " capitalist roader " artist or intellectual , you were sent to the countryside to be " re-educated , " meaning you were tortured and persecuted .
even if you managed to come out physically alive , your spirit was broken .
this was the china that my side of the family had the luck to escape .
rejecting the chairman 's wife today 's china bears no resemblance to the big brother nation i once knew .
that does n't mean that china still does n't have a long way to go in terms of human rights and press freedoms as the beijing olympics have demonstrated , but the people 's republic has also come a very , very long way in just one generation .
china has even advanced so much economically and politically now that it has become a country my family would not have fled at the time of the communist takeover in 1949 .
my grandfather had been a shanghai industrialist who made a fortune as the chinese agent for ig farben , the pre-war amalgam of germany 's basf , bayer and hoechst today .
being a bourgeois capitalist was bad enough for the communists .
even worse , he had also produced movies , in which a two-bit actress named jiang qing was rejected for a plum role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist with german business ties could n't survive mao jiang was to later become madame mao and used her tremendous power as the chairman 's wife to exact ruthless revenge on those who had slighted her .
when it became clear that the nationalist chinese government was doomed in 1948 , shanghai 's business elite , including grandpa , knew they could n't survive under mao , so they had escaped to british hong kong before china 's borders were sealed for the next thirty years . " hong kong will take over china ! " by the 1970s , the combination of british governance and a laissez-faire economy enabled the chinese from the mainland to turn hong kong into one of asia 's four industrial tigers along with singapore , south korea and taiwan , where the nationalists had fled .
china , meanwhile , had been in the throes of the cultural revolution .
then mao died and jiang qing was purged from the party , ending an era of totalitarian communist rule and political isolation .
after a power struggle between the hardliners and pragmatists , china 's reformist leader deng xiao ping emerged in 1979 with his famous adage , " it does n't matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice . "
revolutionary ideology was out , go-go capitalism was in , and the economic advances in the last decades that have been on display during the olympics , have been breathtaking .
but along with higher living standards and double-digit growth , came greed , official corruption and environmental degradation .
why bother to ride a bike when you can drive a bmw ? bildunterschrift : the oriental pearl tv tower is a symbol of shanghai 's building boom and modernity in 1997 , the british lease on hong kong island had expired and the former crown colony was turned over to china .
when i expressed concern about the changeover , a close family friend who had been a communist official retorted , " you think mighty china is going to swallow tiny hong kong ?
balderdash !
it 's hong kong that will take over china ! "
he was right .
my german-born , teenage daughter was in shanghai earlier this year .
i asked her how it was . " i was in the oriental pearl tower , the jewish refugee museum , the shanghai cathedral , the -lrb- famous waterfront -rrb- bund ... and starbucks ! " she said , showing me photos of ultra-modern gleaming skyscrapers that outshone even hong kong . two steps forward , one step back political reform has n't kept pace with economic growth though .
the same official explained that the process of political liberalization is not a straight trajectory . " china takes two steps forward and one step back , but still moves forward , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks were able to openly worship starting the 1980s in the 1980s many temples , churches and mosques that had been smashed during the cultural revolution had been restored and religion was tolerated as long as it was kept a private matter .
china opened up to mass tourism , but kept foreign visitors on a leash .
chinese dissenters were able to come out in the open and criticize the party and its policies , but then the pro-democracy movement at tiananmen square was brutally crushed in 1989 . journalists can now travel in more remote regions than ever before , but during the games their movements are restricted in the name of national security . there are now more internet users in china than anywhere on earth , a by product of globalization .
then china 's politicos tried to control the flow of information by blocking " sensitive " news web sites , including deutsche welle 's , right before the games but a media furor convinced them to change their minds . the chinese leadership quietly indicated they are prepared to invite the dalai lama to china for talks , according to the new york times .
if tibet 's exiled spiritual leader actually sets foot on chinese soil for the first time in nearly 50 years , this would be a big step forward . and so it goes .
a political opening that goes too far and the brakes are slammed with china going into reverse gear .
two steps forward and one step back .
and forward again . diana fong is a reporter at dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but demonizing russia wo n't help , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the georgian conflict significantly worsened the relationship between the nato countries of the west and russia .
signs of escalation on both sides are unmistakable . the nato-russia council will be suspended by the west until russian troops have pulled out from georgia proper .
as a countermove , russia is calling back its nato representatives and canceling all planned maneuvers with nato for 2008 . and that 's not all .
an agreement regarding a georgia resolution has not been achieved by the un security council , and in warsaw , americans and poles are signing an agreement to station a missile shield - a move that the russians perceive as a threat . a foreign policy rival the deterioration of the west 's relationship with russia is accompanied by heated social discussions in which poland and eastern central europe in particular are painting russia as an aggressive imperialistic power - as if the kremlin were on the verge of attacking the former soviet union or the warsaw pact states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel indeed , there is no doubt that the invasion of georgia proper by russian troops , as well as the air strikes on georgian targets outside of south ossetia , were excessive .
russia went too far .
and the us and eu states are rightfully asking that russia 's unacceptable overreaction now be corrected .
nevertheless , it is wrong to answer russia with an equally irrational reaction . it 's always been known that russia is and will remain a difficult partner .
russia already took over the job of protector state over abkhazia and south ossetia years ago .
saakashvili 's attempt to reconquer the separatist south ossetian region with military force was a dangerous undertaking from the outset and one that was destined to end in a political and humanitarian disaster . it borders on political naivite to believe that russia would act differently than it did . an uncomfortable partner now a clear realpolitik is needed with russia , without yielding to moscow in georgia .
georgia 's independence and territorial integrity must be protected .
europe 's interest in peace and stability requires it . at the same time , it does n't help to demonize russia now and practice a consequent policy of containment and orbit , because having a good relationship with russia is in our own interests when it comes to other issues . these include energy supply , iran 's nuclear program , the reconstruction of afghanistan , the middle east and the north korea conflict . the caucasus conflict should not be made into the lynchpin for the definition of the west 's relationship with russia .
consideration of russian interests in the caucasus conflict does n't have to mean submission to russian policy , but rather is an intelligent approach that is in europe 's best interest . and when it comes down to it , harsh realpolitik is the only thing russian politics understands . ingo mannteufel is the head of dw 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in total , baa runs seven british airports . the final decision over the future of the airports would be taken in april , said the commission , which had found that the undivided ownership of britain 's leading airports was having " adverse consequences " on air traffic for passengers and airlines . reacting to the report , baa chief colin matthews insisted the company would not sell heathrow , yet he conceded the watchdog 's findings on " poor service " and " frustration " for passengers . german firm watching baa situation in germany , essen-based company hochtief said it continued to have a " great interest " in gatwick , the uk 's second-largest airport . hochtief is germany 's largest construction company with subsidiaries in the us and australia . however , it remained unclear at this time when and under which conditions the company would get involved , a company spokeswoman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baa-owned stansted airport may be up for sale in the near future she said the company would also be interested in other baa airports should they become available .

the company is currently considering stakes in airports in riga , st. petersburg and prague . delays , service standards to blame baa , which belongs to spanish multinational grupo ferrovial , has come under pressure in recent years over delays and service standards at its airports .
the report especially blamed the company for slow responses to passenger concerns and the failure to expand its airports ' capacities . the company reacted by accusing the competition watchdog of errors in judgment and said an airport sale would be counterproductive . airlines including ryanair , virgin atlantic airways and easyjet welcomed the commission 's findings . british airport operator manchester airport group also expressed interest in one of the three london hubs , which process 90 percent of all air traffic into london . the group , which operates airports in manchester , bournemouth , east midlands and humberside , said it was considering " one or more " baa airports . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .
however , in the interview with german public broadcaster ard on friday , he added that moscow 's use of force in georgia was " fully disproportionate " to the severity of the situation . buffer zone a point of contention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian president has rejected the idea of a buffer zone russian president dmitry medvedev has promised that all but 500 russian troops would be withdrawn from georgia by then . moscow said those remaining troops would be stationed in what it termed as " zone of responsibility " as part of a peacekeeping operation to protect south ossetia .
this would leave russian troops present inside the georgian heartland and close to its economically vital east-west highway .
boldryev made no reference those 500 troops in his remarks . georgian president mikhail saakashvili has said he would not stand for their presence . " there will be no buffer zones , " he told reuters news agency in the georgian capital , tbilisi .

he had earlier traveled through russian-controlled checkpoints to the city of gori where russian troops were still present , deep inside georgia . stubb , who is also the finnish foreign minister , said he had witnessed " atrocious sights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 22.08.2008 opinion : you 've come a long way beijing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : years ago , china did n't have a pollution problem on city streets since everyone biked china has a long way to go with democratic reforms , but the olympic games represent a milestone for how far it has already come .
dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years . the year was 1977 shortly after the death of mao , and i had gotten a special visa reserved for young “ overseas chinese ” to visit the motherland .
back then china was an impoverished police state that had just emerged from the political chaos and violence of the cultural revolution , a misnomer for a movement that destroyed any shred of culture whatsoever .
i could n't even utter the name mao in public except to glorify him , let alone criticize the chinese government .
my visa was restricted to the one city where some cousins still lived - shanghai , which many chinese call the berlin of the east for its dazzle , sophistication , progressive politics and historical baggage . striking uniformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's portrait remains , but his ideology is gone i could n't walk down the streets wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt without being interrogated by the neighborhood watchdogs about my western apparel .
everyone wore shapeless uniform jackets and baggy trousers in faded green , blue or grey . there was hardly a single western face on the streets in this most cosmopolitan of all chinese cities .
if a fair-haired , blue-eyed foreigner appeared in public , he was swarmed by a crowd of onlookers .
there were few businessmen and diplomats , no tourists and no accredited journalists in china .
physical movement was restricted by lack of transport .
there were a few city trams , no cars or subways and if anyone tried to bike outside the city limits , the " border police " were ever present .
but at least the chinese had clean air . omnipresence of the state if you were an ordinary chinese citizen , the state regulated every aspect of your life down to whether you were practicing birth control to make sure you adhered to the restrictive one-child only family policy . you could forget about choosing your own line of work or place of residence - the state assigned you a job and living quarters .
and if you wanted to get married , you needed a stamp of approval from your work unit , which had to ensure that the future spouse was " politically clean . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dress codes were more relaxed for children than adults if you were labeled a " capitalist roader " artist or intellectual , you were sent to the countryside to be " re-educated , " meaning you were tortured and persecuted .
even if you managed to come out physically alive , your spirit was broken .
this was the china that my side of the family had the luck to escape .
rejecting the chairman 's wife today 's china bears no resemblance to the big brother nation i once knew .
that does n't mean that china still does n't have a long way to go in terms of human rights and press freedoms as the beijing olympics have demonstrated , but the people 's republic has also come a very , very long way in just one generation .
china has even advanced so much economically and politically now that it has become a country my family would not have fled at the time of the communist takeover in 1949 .
my grandfather had been a shanghai industrialist who made a fortune as the chinese agent for ig farben , the pre-war amalgam of germany 's basf , bayer and hoechst today .
being a bourgeois capitalist was bad enough for the communists .
even worse , he had also produced movies , in which a two-bit actress named jiang qing was rejected for a plum role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist with german business ties could n't survive mao jiang was to later become madame mao and used her tremendous power as the chairman 's wife to exact ruthless revenge on those who had slighted her .
when it became clear that the nationalist chinese government was doomed in 1948 , shanghai 's business elite , including grandpa , knew they could n't survive under mao , so they had escaped to british hong kong before china 's borders were sealed for the next thirty years . " hong kong will take over china ! " by the 1970s , the combination of british governance and a laissez-faire economy enabled the chinese from the mainland to turn hong kong into one of asia 's four industrial tigers along with singapore , south korea and taiwan , where the nationalists had fled .
china , meanwhile , had been in the throes of the cultural revolution .
then mao died and jiang qing was purged from the party , ending an era of totalitarian communist rule and political isolation .
after a power struggle between the hardliners and pragmatists , china 's reformist leader deng xiao ping emerged in 1979 with his famous adage , " it does n't matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice . "
revolutionary ideology was out , go-go capitalism was in , and the economic advances in the last decades that have been on display during the olympics , have been breathtaking .
but along with higher living standards and double-digit growth , came greed , official corruption and environmental degradation .
why bother to ride a bike when you can drive a bmw ? bildunterschrift : the oriental pearl tv tower is a symbol of shanghai 's building boom and modernity in 1997 , the british lease on hong kong island had expired and the former crown colony was turned over to china .
when i expressed concern about the changeover , a close family friend who had been a communist official retorted , " you think mighty china is going to swallow tiny hong kong ?
balderdash !
it 's hong kong that will take over china ! "
he was right .
my german-born , teenage daughter was in shanghai earlier this year .
i asked her how it was . " i was in the oriental pearl tower , the jewish refugee museum , the shanghai cathedral , the -lrb- famous waterfront -rrb- bund ... and starbucks ! " she said , showing me photos of ultra-modern gleaming skyscrapers that outshone even hong kong . two steps forward , one step back political reform has n't kept pace with economic growth though .
the same official explained that the process of political liberalization is not a straight trajectory . " china takes two steps forward and one step back , but still moves forward , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks were able to openly worship starting the 1980s in the 1980s many temples , churches and mosques that had been smashed during the cultural revolution had been restored and religion was tolerated as long as it was kept a private matter .
china opened up to mass tourism , but kept foreign visitors on a leash .
chinese dissenters were able to come out in the open and criticize the party and its policies , but then the pro-democracy movement at tiananmen square was brutally crushed in 1989 . journalists can now travel in more remote regions than ever before , but during the games their movements are restricted in the name of national security . there are now more internet users in china than anywhere on earth , a by product of globalization .
then china 's politicos tried to control the flow of information by blocking " sensitive " news web sites , including deutsche welle 's , right before the games but a media furor convinced them to change their minds . the chinese leadership quietly indicated they are prepared to invite the dalai lama to china for talks , according to the new york times .
if tibet 's exiled spiritual leader actually sets foot on chinese soil for the first time in nearly 50 years , this would be a big step forward . and so it goes .
a political opening that goes too far and the brakes are slammed with china going into reverse gear .
two steps forward and one step back .
and forward again . diana fong is a reporter at dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but demonizing russia wo n't help , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the georgian conflict significantly worsened the relationship between the nato countries of the west and russia .
signs of escalation on both sides are unmistakable . the nato-russia council will be suspended by the west until russian troops have pulled out from georgia proper .
as a countermove , russia is calling back its nato representatives and canceling all planned maneuvers with nato for 2008 . and that 's not all .
an agreement regarding a georgia resolution has not been achieved by the un security council , and in warsaw , americans and poles are signing an agreement to station a missile shield - a move that the russians perceive as a threat . a foreign policy rival the deterioration of the west 's relationship with russia is accompanied by heated social discussions in which poland and eastern central europe in particular are painting russia as an aggressive imperialistic power - as if the kremlin were on the verge of attacking the former soviet union or the warsaw pact states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel indeed , there is no doubt that the invasion of georgia proper by russian troops , as well as the air strikes on georgian targets outside of south ossetia , were excessive .
russia went too far .
and the us and eu states are rightfully asking that russia 's unacceptable overreaction now be corrected .
nevertheless , it is wrong to answer russia with an equally irrational reaction . it 's always been known that russia is and will remain a difficult partner .
russia already took over the job of protector state over abkhazia and south ossetia years ago .
saakashvili 's attempt to reconquer the separatist south ossetian region with military force was a dangerous undertaking from the outset and one that was destined to end in a political and humanitarian disaster . it borders on political naivite to believe that russia would act differently than it did . an uncomfortable partner now a clear realpolitik is needed with russia , without yielding to moscow in georgia .
georgia 's independence and territorial integrity must be protected .
europe 's interest in peace and stability requires it . at the same time , it does n't help to demonize russia now and practice a consequent policy of containment and orbit , because having a good relationship with russia is in our own interests when it comes to other issues . these include energy supply , iran 's nuclear program , the reconstruction of afghanistan , the middle east and the north korea conflict . the caucasus conflict should not be made into the lynchpin for the definition of the west 's relationship with russia .
consideration of russian interests in the caucasus conflict does n't have to mean submission to russian policy , but rather is an intelligent approach that is in europe 's best interest . and when it comes down to it , harsh realpolitik is the only thing russian politics understands . ingo mannteufel is the head of dw 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years . the year was 1977 shortly after the death of mao , and i had gotten a special visa reserved for young “ overseas chinese ” to visit the motherland .
back then china was an impoverished police state that had just emerged from the political chaos and violence of the cultural revolution , a misnomer for a movement that destroyed any shred of culture whatsoever .
i could n't even utter the name mao in public except to glorify him , let alone criticize the chinese government .
my visa was restricted to the one city where some cousins still lived - shanghai , which many chinese call the berlin of the east for its dazzle , sophistication , progressive politics and historical baggage . striking uniformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's portrait remains , but his ideology is gone i could n't walk down the streets wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt without being interrogated by the neighborhood watchdogs about my western apparel .
everyone wore shapeless uniform jackets and baggy trousers in faded green , blue or grey . there was hardly a single western face on the streets in this most cosmopolitan of all chinese cities .
if a fair-haired , blue-eyed foreigner appeared in public , he was swarmed by a crowd of onlookers .
there were few businessmen and diplomats , no tourists and no accredited journalists in china .
physical movement was restricted by lack of transport .
there were a few city trams , no cars or subways and if anyone tried to bike outside the city limits , the " border police " were ever present .
but at least the chinese had clean air . omnipresence of the state if you were an ordinary chinese citizen , the state regulated every aspect of your life down to whether you were practicing birth control to make sure you adhered to the restrictive one-child only family policy . you could forget about choosing your own line of work or place of residence - the state assigned you a job and living quarters .
and if you wanted to get married , you needed a stamp of approval from your work unit , which had to ensure that the future spouse was " politically clean . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dress codes were more relaxed for children than adults if you were labeled a " capitalist roader " artist or intellectual , you were sent to the countryside to be " re-educated , " meaning you were tortured and persecuted .
even if you managed to come out physically alive , your spirit was broken .
this was the china that my side of the family had the luck to escape .
rejecting the chairman 's wife today 's china bears no resemblance to the big brother nation i once knew .
that does n't mean that china still does n't have a long way to go in terms of human rights and press freedoms as the beijing olympics have demonstrated , but the people 's republic has also come a very , very long way in just one generation .
china has even advanced so much economically and politically now that it has become a country my family would not have fled at the time of the communist takeover in 1949 .
my grandfather had been a shanghai industrialist who made a fortune as the chinese agent for ig farben , the pre-war amalgam of germany 's basf , bayer and hoechst today .
being a bourgeois capitalist was bad enough for the communists .
even worse , he had also produced movies , in which a two-bit actress named jiang qing was rejected for a plum role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist with german business ties could n't survive mao jiang was to later become madame mao and used her tremendous power as the chairman 's wife to exact ruthless revenge on those who had slighted her .
when it became clear that the nationalist chinese government was doomed in 1948 , shanghai 's business elite , including grandpa , knew they could n't survive under mao , so they had escaped to british hong kong before china 's borders were sealed for the next thirty years . " hong kong will take over china ! " by the 1970s , the combination of british governance and a laissez-faire economy enabled the chinese from the mainland to turn hong kong into one of asia 's four industrial tigers along with singapore , south korea and taiwan , where the nationalists had fled .
china , meanwhile , had been in the throes of the cultural revolution .
then mao died and jiang qing was purged from the party , ending an era of totalitarian communist rule and political isolation .
after a power struggle between the hardliners and pragmatists , china 's reformist leader deng xiao ping emerged in 1979 with his famous adage , " it does n't matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice . "
revolutionary ideology was out , go-go capitalism was in , and the economic advances in the last decades that have been on display during the olympics , have been breathtaking .
but along with higher living standards and double-digit growth , came greed , official corruption and environmental degradation .
why bother to ride a bike when you can drive a bmw ? bildunterschrift : the oriental pearl tv tower is a symbol of shanghai 's building boom and modernity in 1997 , the british lease on hong kong island had expired and the former crown colony was turned over to china .
when i expressed concern about the changeover , a close family friend who had been a communist official retorted , " you think mighty china is going to swallow tiny hong kong ?
balderdash !
it 's hong kong that will take over china ! "
he was right .
my german-born , teenage daughter was in shanghai earlier this year .
i asked her how it was . " i was in the oriental pearl tower , the jewish refugee museum , the shanghai cathedral , the -lrb- famous waterfront -rrb- bund ... and starbucks ! " she said , showing me photos of ultra-modern gleaming skyscrapers that outshone even hong kong . two steps forward , one step back political reform has n't kept pace with economic growth though .
the same official explained that the process of political liberalization is not a straight trajectory . " china takes two steps forward and one step back , but still moves forward , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks were able to openly worship starting the 1980s in the 1980s many temples , churches and mosques that had been smashed during the cultural revolution had been restored and religion was tolerated as long as it was kept a private matter .
china opened up to mass tourism , but kept foreign visitors on a leash .
chinese dissenters were able to come out in the open and criticize the party and its policies , but then the pro-democracy movement at tiananmen square was brutally crushed in 1989 . journalists can now travel in more remote regions than ever before , but during the games their movements are restricted in the name of national security . there are now more internet users in china than anywhere on earth , a by product of globalization .
then china 's politicos tried to control the flow of information by blocking " sensitive " news web sites , including deutsche welle 's , right before the games but a media furor convinced them to change their minds . the chinese leadership quietly indicated they are prepared to invite the dalai lama to china for talks , according to the new york times .
if tibet 's exiled spiritual leader actually sets foot on chinese soil for the first time in nearly 50 years , this would be a big step forward . and so it goes .
a political opening that goes too far and the brakes are slammed with china going into reverse gear .
two steps forward and one step back .

revolutionary ideology was out , go-go capitalism was in , and the economic advances in the last decades that have been on display during the olympics , have been breathtaking .
but along with higher living standards and double-digit growth , came greed , official corruption and environmental degradation .
why bother to ride a bike when you can drive a bmw ? bildunterschrift : the oriental pearl tv tower is a symbol of shanghai 's building boom and modernity in 1997 , the british lease on hong kong island had expired and the former crown colony was turned over to china .
when i expressed concern about the changeover , a close family friend who had been a communist official retorted , " you think mighty china is going to swallow tiny hong kong ?
balderdash !
it 's hong kong that will take over china ! "
he was right .
my german-born , teenage daughter was in shanghai earlier this year .
i asked her how it was . " i was in the oriental pearl tower , the jewish refugee museum , the shanghai cathedral , the -lrb- famous waterfront -rrb- bund ... and starbucks ! " she said , showing me photos of ultra-modern gleaming skyscrapers that outshone even hong kong . two steps forward , one step back political reform has n't kept pace with economic growth though .
the same official explained that the process of political liberalization is not a straight trajectory . " china takes two steps forward and one step back , but still moves forward , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks were able to openly worship starting the 1980s in the 1980s many temples , churches and mosques that had been smashed during the cultural revolution had been restored and religion was tolerated as long as it was kept a private matter .
china opened up to mass tourism , but kept foreign visitors on a leash .
chinese dissenters were able to come out in the open and criticize the party and its policies , but then the pro-democracy movement at tiananmen square was brutally crushed in 1989 . journalists can now travel in more remote regions than ever before , but during the games their movements are restricted in the name of national security . there are now more internet users in china than anywhere on earth , a by product of globalization .
then china 's politicos tried to control the flow of information by blocking " sensitive " news web sites , including deutsche welle 's , right before the games but a media furor convinced them to change their minds . the chinese leadership quietly indicated they are prepared to invite the dalai lama to china for talks , according to the new york times .
if tibet 's exiled spiritual leader actually sets foot on chinese soil for the first time in nearly 50 years , this would be a big step forward . and so it goes .
a political opening that goes too far and the brakes are slammed with china going into reverse gear .
two steps forward and one step back .
and forward again . diana fong is a reporter at dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but demonizing russia wo n't help , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the georgian conflict significantly worsened the relationship between the nato countries of the west and russia .
signs of escalation on both sides are unmistakable . the nato-russia council will be suspended by the west until russian troops have pulled out from georgia proper .
as a countermove , russia is calling back its nato representatives and canceling all planned maneuvers with nato for 2008 . and that 's not all .
an agreement regarding a georgia resolution has not been achieved by the un security council , and in warsaw , americans and poles are signing an agreement to station a missile shield - a move that the russians perceive as a threat . a foreign policy rival the deterioration of the west 's relationship with russia is accompanied by heated social discussions in which poland and eastern central europe in particular are painting russia as an aggressive imperialistic power - as if the kremlin were on the verge of attacking the former soviet union or the warsaw pact states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel indeed , there is no doubt that the invasion of georgia proper by russian troops , as well as the air strikes on georgian targets outside of south ossetia , were excessive .
russia went too far .
and the us and eu states are rightfully asking that russia 's unacceptable overreaction now be corrected .
nevertheless , it is wrong to answer russia with an equally irrational reaction . it 's always been known that russia is and will remain a difficult partner .
russia already took over the job of protector state over abkhazia and south ossetia years ago .
saakashvili 's attempt to reconquer the separatist south ossetian region with military force was a dangerous undertaking from the outset and one that was destined to end in a political and humanitarian disaster . it borders on political naivite to believe that russia would act differently than it did . an uncomfortable partner now a clear realpolitik is needed with russia , without yielding to moscow in georgia .
georgia 's independence and territorial integrity must be protected .
europe 's interest in peace and stability requires it . at the same time , it does n't help to demonize russia now and practice a consequent policy of containment and orbit , because having a good relationship with russia is in our own interests when it comes to other issues . these include energy supply , iran 's nuclear program , the reconstruction of afghanistan , the middle east and the north korea conflict . the caucasus conflict should not be made into the lynchpin for the definition of the west 's relationship with russia .
consideration of russian interests in the caucasus conflict does n't have to mean submission to russian policy , but rather is an intelligent approach that is in europe 's best interest . and when it comes down to it , harsh realpolitik is the only thing russian politics understands . ingo mannteufel is the head of dw 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .
however , in the interview with german public broadcaster ard on friday , he added that moscow 's use of force in georgia was " fully disproportionate " to the severity of the situation . buffer zone a point of contention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian president has rejected the idea of a buffer zone russian president dmitry medvedev has promised that all but 500 russian troops would be withdrawn from georgia by then . moscow said those remaining troops would be stationed in what it termed as " zone of responsibility " as part of a peacekeeping operation to protect south ossetia .
this would leave russian troops present inside the georgian heartland and close to its economically vital east-west highway .
boldryev made no reference those 500 troops in his remarks . georgian president mikhail saakashvili has said he would not stand for their presence . " there will be no buffer zones , " he told reuters news agency in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
" we will never live with any buffer zones .
we 'll never allow anything like this . " osce observers due monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee camp for georgians from south ossetia and gori meanwhile , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has announced that twenty of its observers will be ready to start monitoring a ceasefire between georgia and russia from monday . " by monday most of the equipment will be in place - especially the armored vehicles - we will have our staff here , we will have our operational center set up and we can start sending out monitors into various parts in georgia and neighboring south ossetia , " said alexander stubb , the pan-european security organization 's chairman . his comments came while visiting a refugee camp on the outskirts of tbilisi .
he had earlier traveled through russian-controlled checkpoints to the city of gori where russian troops were still present , deep inside georgia . stubb , who is also the finnish foreign minister , said he had witnessed " atrocious sights . " " there are russian interior ministry special forces bringing old people from villages , basically emptying the villages on the south ossetian side and dumping them in gori , " he told reuters . no agreement at security council russia late thursday submitted a formal text to the un security council aimed at ending the conflict in georgia , but the united states and britain said they were not ready to vote for it . the 15-nation council also had a second draft resolution for consideration from france , the current president of the european union , which called for the immediate and definite withdrawal of russian troops from georgia , including south ossetia and abkhazia , a cease-fire and international negotiations to settle the issues between georgia and russia . british ambassador john sawers told reporters following a two-hour closed-door discussion by the council that the body was not ready to adopt either the russian or the french draft because of the unsettled conditions on the ground in georgia . " we do need to see real progress on the ground , " sawers said referring to demands for russia to pull out of georgia . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in total , baa runs seven british airports . the final decision over the future of the airports would be taken in april , said the commission , which had found that the undivided ownership of britain 's leading airports was having " adverse consequences " on air traffic for passengers and airlines . reacting to the report , baa chief colin matthews insisted the company would not sell heathrow , yet he conceded the watchdog 's findings on " poor service " and " frustration " for passengers . german firm watching baa situation in germany , essen-based company hochtief said it continued to have a " great interest " in gatwick , the uk 's second-largest airport . hochtief is germany 's largest construction company with subsidiaries in the us and australia . however , it remained unclear at this time when and under which conditions the company would get involved , a company spokeswoman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baa-owned stansted airport may be up for sale in the near future she said the company would also be interested in other baa airports should they become available .

the company is currently considering stakes in airports in riga , st. petersburg and prague . delays , service standards to blame baa , which belongs to spanish multinational grupo ferrovial , has come under pressure in recent years over delays and service standards at its airports .
the report especially blamed the company for slow responses to passenger concerns and the failure to expand its airports ' capacities . the company reacted by accusing the competition watchdog of errors in judgment and said an airport sale would be counterproductive . airlines including ryanair , virgin atlantic airways and easyjet welcomed the commission 's findings . british airport operator manchester airport group also expressed interest in one of the three london hubs , which process 90 percent of all air traffic into london . the group , which operates airports in manchester , bournemouth , east midlands and humberside , said it was considering " one or more " baa airports . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .
however , in the interview with german public broadcaster ard on friday , he added that moscow 's use of force in georgia was " fully disproportionate " to the severity of the situation . buffer zone a point of contention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian president has rejected the idea of a buffer zone russian president dmitry medvedev has promised that all but 500 russian troops would be withdrawn from georgia by then . moscow said those remaining troops would be stationed in what it termed as " zone of responsibility " as part of a peacekeeping operation to protect south ossetia .
this would leave russian troops present inside the georgian heartland and close to its economically vital east-west highway .
boldryev made no reference those 500 troops in his remarks . georgian president mikhail saakashvili has said he would not stand for their presence . " there will be no buffer zones , " he told reuters news agency in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
" we will never live with any buffer zones .
we 'll never allow anything like this .

" by monday most of the equipment will be in place - especially the armored vehicles - we will have our staff here , we will have our operational center set up and we can start sending out monitors into various parts in georgia and neighboring south ossetia , " said alexander stubb , the pan-european security organization 's chairman . his comments came while visiting a refugee camp on the outskirts of tbilisi .
he had earlier traveled through russian-controlled checkpoints to the city of gori where russian troops were still present , deep inside georgia . stubb , who is also the finnish foreign minister , said he had witnessed " atrocious sights . " " there are russian interior ministry special forces bringing old people from villages , basically emptying the villages on the south ossetian side and dumping them in gori , " he told reuters . no agreement at security council russia late thursday submitted a formal text to the un security council aimed at ending the conflict in georgia , but the united states and britain said they were not ready to vote for it . the 15-nation council also had a second draft resolution for consideration from france , the current president of the european union , which called for the immediate and definite withdrawal of russian troops from georgia , including south ossetia and abkhazia , a cease-fire and international negotiations to settle the issues between georgia and russia . british ambassador john sawers told reporters following a two-hour closed-door discussion by the council that the body was not ready to adopt either the russian or the french draft because of the unsettled conditions on the ground in georgia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.08.2008 opinion : west should redefine ties with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has to find a response to russia after the conflict with georgia .
but demonizing russia wo n't help , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the georgian conflict significantly worsened the relationship between the nato countries of the west and russia .
signs of escalation on both sides are unmistakable . the nato-russia council will be suspended by the west until russian troops have pulled out from georgia proper .
as a countermove , russia is calling back its nato representatives and canceling all planned maneuvers with nato for 2008 . and that 's not all .
an agreement regarding a georgia resolution has not been achieved by the un security council , and in warsaw , americans and poles are signing an agreement to station a missile shield - a move that the russians perceive as a threat . a foreign policy rival the deterioration of the west 's relationship with russia is accompanied by heated social discussions in which poland and eastern central europe in particular are painting russia as an aggressive imperialistic power - as if the kremlin were on the verge of attacking the former soviet union or the warsaw pact states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel indeed , there is no doubt that the invasion of georgia proper by russian troops , as well as the air strikes on georgian targets outside of south ossetia , were excessive .
russia went too far .
and the us and eu states are rightfully asking that russia 's unacceptable overreaction now be corrected .
nevertheless , it is wrong to answer russia with an equally irrational reaction . it 's always been known that russia is and will remain a difficult partner .
russia already took over the job of protector state over abkhazia and south ossetia years ago .
saakashvili 's attempt to reconquer the separatist south ossetian region with military force was a dangerous undertaking from the outset and one that was destined to end in a political and humanitarian disaster . it borders on political naivite to believe that russia would act differently than it did . an uncomfortable partner now a clear realpolitik is needed with russia , without yielding to moscow in georgia .
georgia 's independence and territorial integrity must be protected .
europe 's interest in peace and stability requires it . at the same time , it does n't help to demonize russia now and practice a consequent policy of containment and orbit , because having a good relationship with russia is in our own interests when it comes to other issues . these include energy supply , iran 's nuclear program , the reconstruction of afghanistan , the middle east and the north korea conflict . the caucasus conflict should not be made into the lynchpin for the definition of the west 's relationship with russia .
consideration of russian interests in the caucasus conflict does n't have to mean submission to russian policy , but rather is an intelligent approach that is in europe 's best interest . and when it comes down to it , harsh realpolitik is the only thing russian politics understands . ingo mannteufel is the head of dw 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years . the year was 1977 shortly after the death of mao , and i had gotten a special visa reserved for young “ overseas chinese ” to visit the motherland .
back then china was an impoverished police state that had just emerged from the political chaos and violence of the cultural revolution , a misnomer for a movement that destroyed any shred of culture whatsoever .
i could n't even utter the name mao in public except to glorify him , let alone criticize the chinese government .
my visa was restricted to the one city where some cousins still lived - shanghai , which many chinese call the berlin of the east for its dazzle , sophistication , progressive politics and historical baggage . striking uniformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's portrait remains , but his ideology is gone i could n't walk down the streets wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt without being interrogated by the neighborhood watchdogs about my western apparel .
everyone wore shapeless uniform jackets and baggy trousers in faded green , blue or grey . there was hardly a single western face on the streets in this most cosmopolitan of all chinese cities .
if a fair-haired , blue-eyed foreigner appeared in public , he was swarmed by a crowd of onlookers .
there were few businessmen and diplomats , no tourists and no accredited journalists in china .
physical movement was restricted by lack of transport .
there were a few city trams , no cars or subways and if anyone tried to bike outside the city limits , the " border police " were ever present .
but at least the chinese had clean air . omnipresence of the state if you were an ordinary chinese citizen , the state regulated every aspect of your life down to whether you were practicing birth control to make sure you adhered to the restrictive one-child only family policy . you could forget about choosing your own line of work or place of residence - the state assigned you a job and living quarters .
and if you wanted to get married , you needed a stamp of approval from your work unit , which had to ensure that the future spouse was " politically clean . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dress codes were more relaxed for children than adults if you were labeled a " capitalist roader " artist or intellectual , you were sent to the countryside to be " re-educated , " meaning you were tortured and persecuted .
even if you managed to come out physically alive , your spirit was broken .
this was the china that my side of the family had the luck to escape .
rejecting the chairman 's wife today 's china bears no resemblance to the big brother nation i once knew .
that does n't mean that china still does n't have a long way to go in terms of human rights and press freedoms as the beijing olympics have demonstrated , but the people 's republic has also come a very , very long way in just one generation .
china has even advanced so much economically and politically now that it has become a country my family would not have fled at the time of the communist takeover in 1949 .
my grandfather had been a shanghai industrialist who made a fortune as the chinese agent for ig farben , the pre-war amalgam of germany 's basf , bayer and hoechst today .
being a bourgeois capitalist was bad enough for the communists .
even worse , he had also produced movies , in which a two-bit actress named jiang qing was rejected for a plum role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist with german business ties could n't survive mao jiang was to later become madame mao and used her tremendous power as the chairman 's wife to exact ruthless revenge on those who had slighted her .
when it became clear that the nationalist chinese government was doomed in 1948 , shanghai 's business elite , including grandpa , knew they could n't survive under mao , so they had escaped to british hong kong before china 's borders were sealed for the next thirty years . " hong kong will take over china ! " by the 1970s , the combination of british governance and a laissez-faire economy enabled the chinese from the mainland to turn hong kong into one of asia 's four industrial tigers along with singapore , south korea and taiwan , where the nationalists had fled .
china , meanwhile , had been in the throes of the cultural revolution .
then mao died and jiang qing was purged from the party , ending an era of totalitarian communist rule and political isolation .
after a power struggle between the hardliners and pragmatists , china 's reformist leader deng xiao ping emerged in 1979 with his famous adage , " it does n't matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice . "
revolutionary ideology was out , go-go capitalism was in , and the economic advances in the last decades that have been on display during the olympics , have been breathtaking .
but along with higher living standards and double-digit growth , came greed , official corruption and environmental degradation .
why bother to ride a bike when you can drive a bmw ? bildunterschrift : the oriental pearl tv tower is a symbol of shanghai 's building boom and modernity in 1997 , the british lease on hong kong island had expired and the former crown colony was turned over to china .
when i expressed concern about the changeover , a close family friend who had been a communist official retorted , " you think mighty china is going to swallow tiny hong kong ?
balderdash !
it 's hong kong that will take over china ! "
he was right .
my german-born , teenage daughter was in shanghai earlier this year .
i asked her how it was . " i was in the oriental pearl tower , the jewish refugee museum , the shanghai cathedral , the -lrb- famous waterfront -rrb- bund ... and starbucks ! " she said , showing me photos of ultra-modern gleaming skyscrapers that outshone even hong kong . two steps forward , one step back political reform has n't kept pace with economic growth though .
the same official explained that the process of political liberalization is not a straight trajectory . " china takes two steps forward and one step back , but still moves forward , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks were able to openly worship starting the 1980s in the 1980s many temples , churches and mosques that had been smashed during the cultural revolution had been restored and religion was tolerated as long as it was kept a private matter .
china opened up to mass tourism , but kept foreign visitors on a leash .
chinese dissenters were able to come out in the open and criticize the party and its policies , but then the pro-democracy movement at tiananmen square was brutally crushed in 1989 . journalists can now travel in more remote regions than ever before , but during the games their movements are restricted in the name of national security . there are now more internet users in china than anywhere on earth , a by product of globalization .
then china 's politicos tried to control the flow of information by blocking " sensitive " news web sites , including deutsche welle 's , right before the games but a media furor convinced them to change their minds . the chinese leadership quietly indicated they are prepared to invite the dalai lama to china for talks , according to the new york times .
if tibet 's exiled spiritual leader actually sets foot on chinese soil for the first time in nearly 50 years , this would be a big step forward . and so it goes .
a political opening that goes too far and the brakes are slammed with china going into reverse gear .
two steps forward and one step back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.08.2008 opinion : west should redefine ties with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has to find a response to russia after the conflict with georgia .
but demonizing russia wo n't help , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the georgian conflict significantly worsened the relationship between the nato countries of the west and russia .
signs of escalation on both sides are unmistakable . the nato-russia council will be suspended by the west until russian troops have pulled out from georgia proper .
as a countermove , russia is calling back its nato representatives and canceling all planned maneuvers with nato for 2008 . and that 's not all .
an agreement regarding a georgia resolution has not been achieved by the un security council , and in warsaw , americans and poles are signing an agreement to station a missile shield - a move that the russians perceive as a threat . a foreign policy rival the deterioration of the west 's relationship with russia is accompanied by heated social discussions in which poland and eastern central europe in particular are painting russia as an aggressive imperialistic power - as if the kremlin were on the verge of attacking the former soviet union or the warsaw pact states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel indeed , there is no doubt that the invasion of georgia proper by russian troops , as well as the air strikes on georgian targets outside of south ossetia , were excessive .
russia went too far .
and the us and eu states are rightfully asking that russia 's unacceptable overreaction now be corrected .
nevertheless , it is wrong to answer russia with an equally irrational reaction . it 's always been known that russia is and will remain a difficult partner .
russia already took over the job of protector state over abkhazia and south ossetia years ago .
saakashvili 's attempt to reconquer the separatist south ossetian region with military force was a dangerous undertaking from the outset and one that was destined to end in a political and humanitarian disaster . it borders on political naivite to believe that russia would act differently than it did . an uncomfortable partner now a clear realpolitik is needed with russia , without yielding to moscow in georgia .
georgia 's independence and territorial integrity must be protected .
europe 's interest in peace and stability requires it . at the same time , it does n't help to demonize russia now and practice a consequent policy of containment and orbit , because having a good relationship with russia is in our own interests when it comes to other issues . these include energy supply , iran 's nuclear program , the reconstruction of afghanistan , the middle east and the north korea conflict . the caucasus conflict should not be made into the lynchpin for the definition of the west 's relationship with russia .
consideration of russian interests in the caucasus conflict does n't have to mean submission to russian policy , but rather is an intelligent approach that is in europe 's best interest . and when it comes down to it , harsh realpolitik is the only thing russian politics understands . ingo mannteufel is the head of dw 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de russia : 10 days needed for georgia pullout russia promised to withdraw most forces from deep inside georgia , but was set to retain a military presence in two separatist regions and a buffer zone .

dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years . the year was 1977 shortly after the death of mao , and i had gotten a special visa reserved for young “ overseas chinese ” to visit the motherland .
back then china was an impoverished police state that had just emerged from the political chaos and violence of the cultural revolution , a misnomer for a movement that destroyed any shred of culture whatsoever .
i could n't even utter the name mao in public except to glorify him , let alone criticize the chinese government .
my visa was restricted to the one city where some cousins still lived - shanghai , which many chinese call the berlin of the east for its dazzle , sophistication , progressive politics and historical baggage . striking uniformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's portrait remains , but his ideology is gone i could n't walk down the streets wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt without being interrogated by the neighborhood watchdogs about my western apparel .
everyone wore shapeless uniform jackets and baggy trousers in faded green , blue or grey . there was hardly a single western face on the streets in this most cosmopolitan of all chinese cities .
if a fair-haired , blue-eyed foreigner appeared in public , he was swarmed by a crowd of onlookers .
there were few businessmen and diplomats , no tourists and no accredited journalists in china .
physical movement was restricted by lack of transport .
there were a few city trams , no cars or subways and if anyone tried to bike outside the city limits , the " border police " were ever present .
but at least the chinese had clean air . omnipresence of the state if you were an ordinary chinese citizen , the state regulated every aspect of your life down to whether you were practicing birth control to make sure you adhered to the restrictive one-child only family policy . you could forget about choosing your own line of work or place of residence - the state assigned you a job and living quarters .
and if you wanted to get married , you needed a stamp of approval from your work unit , which had to ensure that the future spouse was " politically clean . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dress codes were more relaxed for children than adults if you were labeled a " capitalist roader " artist or intellectual , you were sent to the countryside to be " re-educated , " meaning you were tortured and persecuted .

this was the china that my side of the family had the luck to escape .
rejecting the chairman 's wife today 's china bears no resemblance to the big brother nation i once knew .
that does n't mean that china still does n't have a long way to go in terms of human rights and press freedoms as the beijing olympics have demonstrated , but the people 's republic has also come a very , very long way in just one generation .
china has even advanced so much economically and politically now that it has become a country my family would not have fled at the time of the communist takeover in 1949 .
my grandfather had been a shanghai industrialist who made a fortune as the chinese agent for ig farben , the pre-war amalgam of germany 's basf , bayer and hoechst today .

dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years . the year was 1977 shortly after the death of mao , and i had gotten a special visa reserved for young “ overseas chinese ” to visit the motherland .

i could n't even utter the name mao in public except to glorify him , let alone criticize the chinese government .

if a fair-haired , blue-eyed foreigner appeared in public , he was swarmed by a crowd of onlookers .
there were few businessmen and diplomats , no tourists and no accredited journalists in china .

my grandfather had been a shanghai industrialist who made a fortune as the chinese agent for ig farben , the pre-war amalgam of germany 's basf , bayer and hoechst today .

dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years . the year was 1977 shortly after the death of mao , and i had gotten a special visa reserved for young “ overseas chinese ” to visit the motherland .
back then china was an impoverished police state that had just emerged from the political chaos and violence of the cultural revolution , a misnomer for a movement that destroyed any shred of culture whatsoever .
i could n't even utter the name mao in public except to glorify him , let alone criticize the chinese government .
my visa was restricted to the one city where some cousins still lived - shanghai , which many chinese call the berlin of the east for its dazzle , sophistication , progressive politics and historical baggage . striking uniformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's portrait remains , but his ideology is gone i could n't walk down the streets wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt without being interrogated by the neighborhood watchdogs about my western apparel .
everyone wore shapeless uniform jackets and baggy trousers in faded green , blue or grey . there was hardly a single western face on the streets in this most cosmopolitan of all chinese cities .
if a fair-haired , blue-eyed foreigner appeared in public , he was swarmed by a crowd of onlookers .
there were few businessmen and diplomats , no tourists and no accredited journalists in china .
physical movement was restricted by lack of transport .
there were a few city trams , no cars or subways and if anyone tried to bike outside the city limits , the " border police " were ever present .
but at least the chinese had clean air . omnipresence of the state if you were an ordinary chinese citizen , the state regulated every aspect of your life down to whether you were practicing birth control to make sure you adhered to the restrictive one-child only family policy . you could forget about choosing your own line of work or place of residence - the state assigned you a job and living quarters .
and if you wanted to get married , you needed a stamp of approval from your work unit , which had to ensure that the future spouse was " politically clean . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dress codes were more relaxed for children than adults if you were labeled a " capitalist roader " artist or intellectual , you were sent to the countryside to be " re-educated , " meaning you were tortured and persecuted .
even if you managed to come out physically alive , your spirit was broken .
this was the china that my side of the family had the luck to escape .
rejecting the chairman 's wife today 's china bears no resemblance to the big brother nation i once knew .
that does n't mean that china still does n't have a long way to go in terms of human rights and press freedoms as the beijing olympics have demonstrated , but the people 's republic has also come a very , very long way in just one generation .
china has even advanced so much economically and politically now that it has become a country my family would not have fled at the time of the communist takeover in 1949 .
my grandfather had been a shanghai industrialist who made a fortune as the chinese agent for ig farben , the pre-war amalgam of germany 's basf , bayer and hoechst today .
being a bourgeois capitalist was bad enough for the communists .
even worse , he had also produced movies , in which a two-bit actress named jiang qing was rejected for a plum role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist with german business ties could n't survive mao jiang was to later become madame mao and used her tremendous power as the chairman 's wife to exact ruthless revenge on those who had slighted her .
when it became clear that the nationalist chinese government was doomed in 1948 , shanghai 's business elite , including grandpa , knew they could n't survive under mao , so they had escaped to british hong kong before china 's borders were sealed for the next thirty years . " hong kong will take over china ! " by the 1970s , the combination of british governance and a laissez-faire economy enabled the chinese from the mainland to turn hong kong into one of asia 's four industrial tigers along with singapore , south korea and taiwan , where the nationalists had fled .
china , meanwhile , had been in the throes of the cultural revolution .
then mao died and jiang qing was purged from the party , ending an era of totalitarian communist rule and political isolation .
after a power struggle between the hardliners and pragmatists , china 's reformist leader deng xiao ping emerged in 1979 with his famous adage , " it does n't matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice . "

dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years . the year was 1977 shortly after the death of mao , and i had gotten a special visa reserved for young “ overseas chinese ” to visit the motherland .
back then china was an impoverished police state that had just emerged from the political chaos and violence of the cultural revolution , a misnomer for a movement that destroyed any shred of culture whatsoever .
i could n't even utter the name mao in public except to glorify him , let alone criticize the chinese government .
my visa was restricted to the one city where some cousins still lived - shanghai , which many chinese call the berlin of the east for its dazzle , sophistication , progressive politics and historical baggage . striking uniformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's portrait remains , but his ideology is gone i could n't walk down the streets wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt without being interrogated by the neighborhood watchdogs about my western apparel .
everyone wore shapeless uniform jackets and baggy trousers in faded green , blue or grey . there was hardly a single western face on the streets in this most cosmopolitan of all chinese cities .
if a fair-haired , blue-eyed foreigner appeared in public , he was swarmed by a crowd of onlookers .
there were few businessmen and diplomats , no tourists and no accredited journalists in china .
physical movement was restricted by lack of transport .
there were a few city trams , no cars or subways and if anyone tried to bike outside the city limits , the " border police " were ever present .
but at least the chinese had clean air . omnipresence of the state if you were an ordinary chinese citizen , the state regulated every aspect of your life down to whether you were practicing birth control to make sure you adhered to the restrictive one-child only family policy . you could forget about choosing your own line of work or place of residence - the state assigned you a job and living quarters .
and if you wanted to get married , you needed a stamp of approval from your work unit , which had to ensure that the future spouse was " politically clean . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dress codes were more relaxed for children than adults if you were labeled a " capitalist roader " artist or intellectual , you were sent to the countryside to be " re-educated , " meaning you were tortured and persecuted .
even if you managed to come out physically alive , your spirit was broken .
this was the china that my side of the family had the luck to escape .
rejecting the chairman 's wife today 's china bears no resemblance to the big brother nation i once knew .
that does n't mean that china still does n't have a long way to go in terms of human rights and press freedoms as the beijing olympics have demonstrated , but the people 's republic has also come a very , very long way in just one generation .
china has even advanced so much economically and politically now that it has become a country my family would not have fled at the time of the communist takeover in 1949 .
my grandfather had been a shanghai industrialist who made a fortune as the chinese agent for ig farben , the pre-war amalgam of germany 's basf , bayer and hoechst today .
being a bourgeois capitalist was bad enough for the communists .
even worse , he had also produced movies , in which a two-bit actress named jiang qing was rejected for a plum role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist with german business ties could n't survive mao jiang was to later become madame mao and used her tremendous power as the chairman 's wife to exact ruthless revenge on those who had slighted her .
when it became clear that the nationalist chinese government was doomed in 1948 , shanghai 's business elite , including grandpa , knew they could n't survive under mao , so they had escaped to british hong kong before china 's borders were sealed for the next thirty years . " hong kong will take over china ! " by the 1970s , the combination of british governance and a laissez-faire economy enabled the chinese from the mainland to turn hong kong into one of asia 's four industrial tigers along with singapore , south korea and taiwan , where the nationalists had fled .
china , meanwhile , had been in the throes of the cultural revolution .
then mao died and jiang qing was purged from the party , ending an era of totalitarian communist rule and political isolation .
after a power struggle between the hardliners and pragmatists , china 's reformist leader deng xiao ping emerged in 1979 with his famous adage , " it does n't matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice . "
revolutionary ideology was out , go-go capitalism was in , and the economic advances in the last decades that have been on display during the olympics , have been breathtaking .
but along with higher living standards and double-digit growth , came greed , official corruption and environmental degradation .
why bother to ride a bike when you can drive a bmw ? bildunterschrift : the oriental pearl tv tower is a symbol of shanghai 's building boom and modernity in 1997 , the british lease on hong kong island had expired and the former crown colony was turned over to china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 22.08.2008 russia : 10 days needed for georgia pullout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians are now said to be pulling out of gori russia promised to withdraw most forces from deep inside georgia , but was set to retain a military presence in two separatist regions and a buffer zone .
troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .
however , in the interview with german public broadcaster ard on friday , he added that moscow 's use of force in georgia was " fully disproportionate " to the severity of the situation . buffer zone a point of contention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian president has rejected the idea of a buffer zone russian president dmitry medvedev has promised that all but 500 russian troops would be withdrawn from georgia by then . moscow said those remaining troops would be stationed in what it termed as " zone of responsibility " as part of a peacekeeping operation to protect south ossetia .
this would leave russian troops present inside the georgian heartland and close to its economically vital east-west highway .
boldryev made no reference those 500 troops in his remarks . georgian president mikhail saakashvili has said he would not stand for their presence . " there will be no buffer zones , " he told reuters news agency in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
" we will never live with any buffer zones .
we 'll never allow anything like this . " osce observers due monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee camp for georgians from south ossetia and gori meanwhile , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has announced that twenty of its observers will be ready to start monitoring a ceasefire between georgia and russia from monday . " by monday most of the equipment will be in place - especially the armored vehicles - we will have our staff here , we will have our operational center set up and we can start sending out monitors into various parts in georgia and neighboring south ossetia , " said alexander stubb , the pan-european security organization 's chairman . his comments came while visiting a refugee camp on the outskirts of tbilisi .
he had earlier traveled through russian-controlled checkpoints to the city of gori where russian troops were still present , deep inside georgia . stubb , who is also the finnish foreign minister , said he had witnessed " atrocious sights . " " there are russian interior ministry special forces bringing old people from villages , basically emptying the villages on the south ossetian side and dumping them in gori , " he told reuters . no agreement at security council russia late thursday submitted a formal text to the un security council aimed at ending the conflict in georgia , but the united states and britain said they were not ready to vote for it . the 15-nation council also had a second draft resolution for consideration from france , the current president of the european union , which called for the immediate and definite withdrawal of russian troops from georgia , including south ossetia and abkhazia , a cease-fire and international negotiations to settle the issues between georgia and russia . british ambassador john sawers told reporters following a two-hour closed-door discussion by the council that the body was not ready to adopt either the russian or the french draft because of the unsettled conditions on the ground in georgia . " we do need to see real progress on the ground , " sawers said referring to demands for russia to pull out of georgia . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .
however , in the interview with german public broadcaster ard on friday , he added that moscow 's use of force in georgia was " fully disproportionate " to the severity of the situation . buffer zone a point of contention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian president has rejected the idea of a buffer zone russian president dmitry medvedev has promised that all but 500 russian troops would be withdrawn from georgia by then . moscow said those remaining troops would be stationed in what it termed as " zone of responsibility " as part of a peacekeeping operation to protect south ossetia .
this would leave russian troops present inside the georgian heartland and close to its economically vital east-west highway .
boldryev made no reference those 500 troops in his remarks . georgian president mikhail saakashvili has said he would not stand for their presence . " there will be no buffer zones , " he told reuters news agency in the georgian capital , tbilisi .

22 but were still operating checkpoints despite pledges to leave by the end of the day .
columns were reportedly headed for south ossetia and abkhazia . as the united nations again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict , russia finally began to withdraw , in line with a french-brokered plan , from the strongly pro-western ex-soviet republic .
the russian general staff said that troops were " in the final stage of pulling back , " but they would continue to hold buffer zones and maintain peacekeeping forces in the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .
the united states has criticized the planned buffer zone as a half-way measure that fails to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
russian armored columns were moving north from the central gori sector in south ossetia , but a defensive cordon remained in place with checkpoints outside gori and near the georgian village of igoeti .
troops heading for south ossetia and abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west and georgia say russia is dragging its heels twenty russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops were seen heading north from near the georgian city of gori toward the separatist region of south ossetia , reporters said .
the nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armored personnel carriers headed towards the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian troopers driving northward on the gori-tskhinvali road shouted " russia ! " and " we 're going home ! "
but reconnaissance , tank , and infantry peacekeepers operating checkpoints in the vicinity said they had not received orders to evacuate .

22 but were still operating checkpoints despite pledges to leave by the end of the day .
columns were reportedly headed for south ossetia and abkhazia . as the united nations again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict , russia finally began to withdraw , in line with a french-brokered plan , from the strongly pro-western ex-soviet republic .
the russian general staff said that troops were " in the final stage of pulling back , " but they would continue to hold buffer zones and maintain peacekeeping forces in the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .
the united states has criticized the planned buffer zone as a half-way measure that fails to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
russian armored columns were moving north from the central gori sector in south ossetia , but a defensive cordon remained in place with checkpoints outside gori and near the georgian village of igoeti .
troops heading for south ossetia and abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west and georgia say russia is dragging its heels twenty russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops were seen heading north from near the georgian city of gori toward the separatist region of south ossetia , reporters said .
the nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armored personnel carriers headed towards the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian troopers driving northward on the gori-tskhinvali road shouted " russia ! " and " we 're going home ! "
but reconnaissance , tank , and infantry peacekeepers operating checkpoints in the vicinity said they had not received orders to evacuate .
russian infantry were continuing to dig in on high ground overlooking a river bridge near igoeti .
fuel tankers were refueling tanks and armored personnel carriers , and supply lorries were delivering food and water to russian troops .
the russian military said 18 additional russian checkpoints were being set up as part of russian-controlled buffer zones along the borders between central georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia respectively .
a contingent of 2,142 russian peacekeeping forces would remain in abkhazia and 452 troops in south ossetia , colonel general nogovitsyn said .
russian forces would be out of georgia proper by 20:00 local time , he said .
criticism continues over delay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columns of troops are heading for the rebel regions aleksander lomia , georgia 's national security council head , in mid-afternoon gave tbilisi 's first official acknowledgement of the russian withdrawal , saying russian forces " were pulling out , but not fast enough , " according to an interfax report .
international criticism has mounted that moscow is delaying withdrawing its troops from georgian territory in accordance with a ceasefire that ended the 10-day conflict .
us president george w bush called for an end to the russian " siege " in a telephone conversation on thursday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , a us ally .
but russian military commanders brushed aside bush 's demands , saying they were complying with the peace accord .
" the president of the united states is on vacation .
obviously , he is not receiving timely information .
we recommend the president 's press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences , " nogovitsyn said .
russians manning checkpoints along the tbilisi-gori road were permitting civilian and humanitarian traffic to pass , but were blocking " unscheduled " diplomats and media .
a russian national flag flew over the gori checkpoint .
georgia 's western region also saw substantial russian withdrawals on friday , with amour and infantry abandoning georgian government buildings in the centre of zugdidi , a town near the border with abkhazia , the georgian secessionist province loyal to moscow .
the western town of senaki , site of georgia 's largest air base , and the port of poti , on the black sea coast , had seen no reductions in russian occupation forces by early afternoon on friday .
russian forces rolled into georgia on august 8 to push back a georgian offensive to re-take control of its rebel south ossetia region , which won de facto autonomy in a civil war in the early 1990s .
russian troops also moved forward in georgia 's other breakaway region of abkhazia , and seized key strategic bases in georgia , including poti .

on thursday , tens of thousands gathered in sukhumi , capital of abkhazia , to demand russian recognition of their independence .
over 1,000 people attended a similar rally in south ossetia 's main town and on friday , the south ossetia parliament formally asked russia to recognize its independence , ria novosti news agency reported .
moscow has hinted at giving both recognition in a move that would risk sparking one of the deepest crises between russia and the west since the cold war .
russia 's two houses of parliament are to discuss the issue monday .
the kremlin has suggested that kosovo serve as a precedent in international law for recognizing the two rebel regions ' bid for independence . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and though they 're too young to remember the cold war , they still feel the old grievances . mariam sits in the main garden outside the university in bonn , germany .
it 's a warm august evening and the sun has just set .
mariam does n't notice .
she is too caught up in the thoughts running through her mind .
mariam , a university student , says she is afraid every day .
afraid for her family and her country . " each day i call my mother in tbilisi and if she does n't answer i am totally overcome by fear .
i 'm convinced that a russian bomb landed on our house , " she says . rage towards russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariam fears for her family 's safety for the past four years mariam has lived in germany , studying economics .
she would like to return to her homeland , but at the moment she does n't dare .
she and her georgian friends follow the unrest in her native country on the television and the internet . mariam and her sister , mtvarisa , are furious with russia and the russian president .
mtvarisa says that russia just can not deal with the fact that georgia is developing in a western fashion . georgia has a very strategic position .
gas and oil pipelines pass through our country , and of course the russians want to control them , she adds . " we have to defend ourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers are out in full force against the russians nino also firmly believes in her country and the georgian president .
she finds saakashvili 's actions commendable .
" we have to defend ourselves , " she says .
it sounds like something memorized at a young age .
nino has been in germany for a year , and is waiting for a spot to open up for her to study medicine . she has just turned 20 .
she never experienced the cold war .
nevertheless , even she feels some of the old hatred when she sees the former frontlines re-outlined : east against west , russia against america - and georgia in the middle , sitting on the fence .
georgia is like a buffer state with an overpowering adversary standing at the door . enemies at the disco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nino completely supports her government for the young georgians , a russian is someone to hate , not to have as a friend .
that 's how it 's always been .
because of that , nino could never imagine herself falling in love with a russian boy , not even here in germany . " after everything that has happened between our countries , it is n't possible anymore , " she says defensively , shaking her head . the young georgian has brought this hate , anger and fear with her to germany .
luckily there are n't any russians living in her dormitory , she says .
though she came across a few in the street one evening recently .
a couple of russian students who were looking for a disco asked nino and mariam if they knew where one was . mariam recognized the accent immediately .
when she and nino told the russians where they were from , the mood darkened , she explains . " and when they asked where we were from , and we told them that we 're georgians , they became aggressive .
one boy screamed : ' russia will kill georgia ' .
i said , you are our enemies , but we will gladly help you find a disco , " she says . " there is no peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian soldiers have still not withdrawn from the country the only solution is for the russians to leave , agree the two students .
they are afraid that russia will simply annex georgia and remove the government . " i could never live under a russian government , " says mariam .
" i am georgian and proud of it . " " there is no peace , " says nino , " the war is over , but the people are still afraid of the russians .
they are still in georgia and refuse to leave .
they ’ re aiming their rockets at tbilisi . " " m-schwi-do-ba " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtvarisa , nino , tamta und mariam occasionally the students have doubts about their hatred for russia , though it 's rare .
sometimes they meet russians who are actually very nice .
like the woman at the language course at the community college .
mariam quickly became friends with this potential enemy .
it didn ’ t last .
" the politics destroyed our friendship , " she says , sadly . because despite all the anger , the georgian students only want one thing : " m-shvi-do-ba , " they say .
it 's georgian , and it means peace . anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years . the year was 1977 shortly after the death of mao , and i had gotten a special visa reserved for young “ overseas chinese ” to visit the motherland .
back then china was an impoverished police state that had just emerged from the political chaos and violence of the cultural revolution , a misnomer for a movement that destroyed any shred of culture whatsoever .
i could n't even utter the name mao in public except to glorify him , let alone criticize the chinese government .
my visa was restricted to the one city where some cousins still lived - shanghai , which many chinese call the berlin of the east for its dazzle , sophistication , progressive politics and historical baggage . striking uniformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's portrait remains , but his ideology is gone i could n't walk down the streets wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt without being interrogated by the neighborhood watchdogs about my western apparel .
everyone wore shapeless uniform jackets and baggy trousers in faded green , blue or grey . there was hardly a single western face on the streets in this most cosmopolitan of all chinese cities .
if a fair-haired , blue-eyed foreigner appeared in public , he was swarmed by a crowd of onlookers .
there were few businessmen and diplomats , no tourists and no accredited journalists in china .
physical movement was restricted by lack of transport .
there were a few city trams , no cars or subways and if anyone tried to bike outside the city limits , the " border police " were ever present .
but at least the chinese had clean air . omnipresence of the state if you were an ordinary chinese citizen , the state regulated every aspect of your life down to whether you were practicing birth control to make sure you adhered to the restrictive one-child only family policy . you could forget about choosing your own line of work or place of residence - the state assigned you a job and living quarters .
and if you wanted to get married , you needed a stamp of approval from your work unit , which had to ensure that the future spouse was " politically clean . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dress codes were more relaxed for children than adults if you were labeled a " capitalist roader " artist or intellectual , you were sent to the countryside to be " re-educated , " meaning you were tortured and persecuted .
even if you managed to come out physically alive , your spirit was broken .
this was the china that my side of the family had the luck to escape .
rejecting the chairman 's wife today 's china bears no resemblance to the big brother nation i once knew .
that does n't mean that china still does n't have a long way to go in terms of human rights and press freedoms as the beijing olympics have demonstrated , but the people 's republic has also come a very , very long way in just one generation .
china has even advanced so much economically and politically now that it has become a country my family would not have fled at the time of the communist takeover in 1949 .
my grandfather had been a shanghai industrialist who made a fortune as the chinese agent for ig farben , the pre-war amalgam of germany 's basf , bayer and hoechst today .
being a bourgeois capitalist was bad enough for the communists .
even worse , he had also produced movies , in which a two-bit actress named jiang qing was rejected for a plum role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist with german business ties could n't survive mao jiang was to later become madame mao and used her tremendous power as the chairman 's wife to exact ruthless revenge on those who had slighted her .
when it became clear that the nationalist chinese government was doomed in 1948 , shanghai 's business elite , including grandpa , knew they could n't survive under mao , so they had escaped to british hong kong before china 's borders were sealed for the next thirty years . " hong kong will take over china ! " by the 1970s , the combination of british governance and a laissez-faire economy enabled the chinese from the mainland to turn hong kong into one of asia 's four industrial tigers along with singapore , south korea and taiwan , where the nationalists had fled .
china , meanwhile , had been in the throes of the cultural revolution .
then mao died and jiang qing was purged from the party , ending an era of totalitarian communist rule and political isolation .
after a power struggle between the hardliners and pragmatists , china 's reformist leader deng xiao ping emerged in 1979 with his famous adage , " it does n't matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice . "
revolutionary ideology was out , go-go capitalism was in , and the economic advances in the last decades that have been on display during the olympics , have been breathtaking .
but along with higher living standards and double-digit growth , came greed , official corruption and environmental degradation .
why bother to ride a bike when you can drive a bmw ? bildunterschrift : the oriental pearl tv tower is a symbol of shanghai 's building boom and modernity in 1997 , the british lease on hong kong island had expired and the former crown colony was turned over to china .
when i expressed concern about the changeover , a close family friend who had been a communist official retorted , " you think mighty china is going to swallow tiny hong kong ?
balderdash !
it 's hong kong that will take over china ! "
he was right .
my german-born , teenage daughter was in shanghai earlier this year .
i asked her how it was . " i was in the oriental pearl tower , the jewish refugee museum , the shanghai cathedral , the -lrb- famous waterfront -rrb- bund ... and starbucks ! " she said , showing me photos of ultra-modern gleaming skyscrapers that outshone even hong kong . two steps forward , one step back political reform has n't kept pace with economic growth though .
the same official explained that the process of political liberalization is not a straight trajectory . " china takes two steps forward and one step back , but still moves forward , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks were able to openly worship starting the 1980s in the 1980s many temples , churches and mosques that had been smashed during the cultural revolution had been restored and religion was tolerated as long as it was kept a private matter .
china opened up to mass tourism , but kept foreign visitors on a leash .
chinese dissenters were able to come out in the open and criticize the party and its policies , but then the pro-democracy movement at tiananmen square was brutally crushed in 1989 . journalists can now travel in more remote regions than ever before , but during the games their movements are restricted in the name of national security . there are now more internet users in china than anywhere on earth , a by product of globalization .
then china 's politicos tried to control the flow of information by blocking " sensitive " news web sites , including deutsche welle 's , right before the games but a media furor convinced them to change their minds . the chinese leadership quietly indicated they are prepared to invite the dalai lama to china for talks , according to the new york times .
if tibet 's exiled spiritual leader actually sets foot on chinese soil for the first time in nearly 50 years , this would be a big step forward . and so it goes .
a political opening that goes too far and the brakes are slammed with china going into reverse gear .
two steps forward and one step back .

even worse , he had also produced movies , in which a two-bit actress named jiang qing was rejected for a plum role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist with german business ties could n't survive mao jiang was to later become madame mao and used her tremendous power as the chairman 's wife to exact ruthless revenge on those who had slighted her .
when it became clear that the nationalist chinese government was doomed in 1948 , shanghai 's business elite , including grandpa , knew they could n't survive under mao , so they had escaped to british hong kong before china 's borders were sealed for the next thirty years . " hong kong will take over china ! " by the 1970s , the combination of british governance and a laissez-faire economy enabled the chinese from the mainland to turn hong kong into one of asia 's four industrial tigers along with singapore , south korea and taiwan , where the nationalists had fled .
china , meanwhile , had been in the throes of the cultural revolution .
then mao died and jiang qing was purged from the party , ending an era of totalitarian communist rule and political isolation .
after a power struggle between the hardliners and pragmatists , china 's reformist leader deng xiao ping emerged in 1979 with his famous adage , " it does n't matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice . "
revolutionary ideology was out , go-go capitalism was in , and the economic advances in the last decades that have been on display during the olympics , have been breathtaking .
but along with higher living standards and double-digit growth , came greed , official corruption and environmental degradation .
why bother to ride a bike when you can drive a bmw ? bildunterschrift : the oriental pearl tv tower is a symbol of shanghai 's building boom and modernity in 1997 , the british lease on hong kong island had expired and the former crown colony was turned over to china .
when i expressed concern about the changeover , a close family friend who had been a communist official retorted , " you think mighty china is going to swallow tiny hong kong ?
balderdash !
it 's hong kong that will take over china ! "
he was right .
my german-born , teenage daughter was in shanghai earlier this year .
i asked her how it was . " i was in the oriental pearl tower , the jewish refugee museum , the shanghai cathedral , the -lrb- famous waterfront -rrb- bund ... and starbucks ! " she said , showing me photos of ultra-modern gleaming skyscrapers that outshone even hong kong . two steps forward , one step back political reform has n't kept pace with economic growth though .
the same official explained that the process of political liberalization is not a straight trajectory . " china takes two steps forward and one step back , but still moves forward , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks were able to openly worship starting the 1980s in the 1980s many temples , churches and mosques that had been smashed during the cultural revolution had been restored and religion was tolerated as long as it was kept a private matter .
china opened up to mass tourism , but kept foreign visitors on a leash .
chinese dissenters were able to come out in the open and criticize the party and its policies , but then the pro-democracy movement at tiananmen square was brutally crushed in 1989 . journalists can now travel in more remote regions than ever before , but during the games their movements are restricted in the name of national security . there are now more internet users in china than anywhere on earth , a by product of globalization .
then china 's politicos tried to control the flow of information by blocking " sensitive " news web sites , including deutsche welle 's , right before the games but a media furor convinced them to change their minds . the chinese leadership quietly indicated they are prepared to invite the dalai lama to china for talks , according to the new york times .
if tibet 's exiled spiritual leader actually sets foot on chinese soil for the first time in nearly 50 years , this would be a big step forward . and so it goes .
a political opening that goes too far and the brakes are slammed with china going into reverse gear .
two steps forward and one step back .
and forward again . diana fong is a reporter at dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 22.08.2008 russia : 10 days needed for georgia pullout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians are now said to be pulling out of gori russia promised to withdraw most forces from deep inside georgia , but was set to retain a military presence in two separatist regions and a buffer zone .
troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .
however , in the interview with german public broadcaster ard on friday , he added that moscow 's use of force in georgia was " fully disproportionate " to the severity of the situation . buffer zone a point of contention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian president has rejected the idea of a buffer zone russian president dmitry medvedev has promised that all but 500 russian troops would be withdrawn from georgia by then . moscow said those remaining troops would be stationed in what it termed as " zone of responsibility " as part of a peacekeeping operation to protect south ossetia .
this would leave russian troops present inside the georgian heartland and close to its economically vital east-west highway .
boldryev made no reference those 500 troops in his remarks . georgian president mikhail saakashvili has said he would not stand for their presence . " there will be no buffer zones , " he told reuters news agency in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
" we will never live with any buffer zones .
we 'll never allow anything like this . " osce observers due monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee camp for georgians from south ossetia and gori meanwhile , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has announced that twenty of its observers will be ready to start monitoring a ceasefire between georgia and russia from monday . " by monday most of the equipment will be in place - especially the armored vehicles - we will have our staff here , we will have our operational center set up and we can start sending out monitors into various parts in georgia and neighboring south ossetia , " said alexander stubb , the pan-european security organization 's chairman . his comments came while visiting a refugee camp on the outskirts of tbilisi .
he had earlier traveled through russian-controlled checkpoints to the city of gori where russian troops were still present , deep inside georgia . stubb , who is also the finnish foreign minister , said he had witnessed " atrocious sights . " " there are russian interior ministry special forces bringing old people from villages , basically emptying the villages on the south ossetian side and dumping them in gori , " he told reuters . no agreement at security council russia late thursday submitted a formal text to the un security council aimed at ending the conflict in georgia , but the united states and britain said they were not ready to vote for it . the 15-nation council also had a second draft resolution for consideration from france , the current president of the european union , which called for the immediate and definite withdrawal of russian troops from georgia , including south ossetia and abkhazia , a cease-fire and international negotiations to settle the issues between georgia and russia . british ambassador john sawers told reporters following a two-hour closed-door discussion by the council that the body was not ready to adopt either the russian or the french draft because of the unsettled conditions on the ground in georgia . " we do need to see real progress on the ground , " sawers said referring to demands for russia to pull out of georgia . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in total , baa runs seven british airports . the final decision over the future of the airports would be taken in april , said the commission , which had found that the undivided ownership of britain 's leading airports was having " adverse consequences " on air traffic for passengers and airlines . reacting to the report , baa chief colin matthews insisted the company would not sell heathrow , yet he conceded the watchdog 's findings on " poor service " and " frustration " for passengers . german firm watching baa situation in germany , essen-based company hochtief said it continued to have a " great interest " in gatwick , the uk 's second-largest airport . hochtief is germany 's largest construction company with subsidiaries in the us and australia . however , it remained unclear at this time when and under which conditions the company would get involved , a company spokeswoman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baa-owned stansted airport may be up for sale in the near future she said the company would also be interested in other baa airports should they become available .

the company is currently considering stakes in airports in riga , st. petersburg and prague . delays , service standards to blame baa , which belongs to spanish multinational grupo ferrovial , has come under pressure in recent years over delays and service standards at its airports .
the report especially blamed the company for slow responses to passenger concerns and the failure to expand its airports ' capacities . the company reacted by accusing the competition watchdog of errors in judgment and said an airport sale would be counterproductive . airlines including ryanair , virgin atlantic airways and easyjet welcomed the commission 's findings . british airport operator manchester airport group also expressed interest in one of the three london hubs , which process 90 percent of all air traffic into london . the group , which operates airports in manchester , bournemouth , east midlands and humberside , said it was considering " one or more " baa airports . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 but were still operating checkpoints despite pledges to leave by the end of the day .
columns were reportedly headed for south ossetia and abkhazia . as the united nations again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict , russia finally began to withdraw , in line with a french-brokered plan , from the strongly pro-western ex-soviet republic .
the russian general staff said that troops were " in the final stage of pulling back , " but they would continue to hold buffer zones and maintain peacekeeping forces in the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .
the united states has criticized the planned buffer zone as a half-way measure that fails to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
russian armored columns were moving north from the central gori sector in south ossetia , but a defensive cordon remained in place with checkpoints outside gori and near the georgian village of igoeti .
troops heading for south ossetia and abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west and georgia say russia is dragging its heels twenty russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops were seen heading north from near the georgian city of gori toward the separatist region of south ossetia , reporters said .
the nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armored personnel carriers headed towards the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian troopers driving northward on the gori-tskhinvali road shouted " russia ! " and " we 're going home ! "
but reconnaissance , tank , and infantry peacekeepers operating checkpoints in the vicinity said they had not received orders to evacuate .
russian infantry were continuing to dig in on high ground overlooking a river bridge near igoeti .
fuel tankers were refueling tanks and armored personnel carriers , and supply lorries were delivering food and water to russian troops .
the russian military said 18 additional russian checkpoints were being set up as part of russian-controlled buffer zones along the borders between central georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia respectively .
a contingent of 2,142 russian peacekeeping forces would remain in abkhazia and 452 troops in south ossetia , colonel general nogovitsyn said .
russian forces would be out of georgia proper by 20:00 local time , he said .
criticism continues over delay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columns of troops are heading for the rebel regions aleksander lomia , georgia 's national security council head , in mid-afternoon gave tbilisi 's first official acknowledgement of the russian withdrawal , saying russian forces " were pulling out , but not fast enough , " according to an interfax report .
international criticism has mounted that moscow is delaying withdrawing its troops from georgian territory in accordance with a ceasefire that ended the 10-day conflict .
us president george w bush called for an end to the russian " siege " in a telephone conversation on thursday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , a us ally .
but russian military commanders brushed aside bush 's demands , saying they were complying with the peace accord .
" the president of the united states is on vacation .
obviously , he is not receiving timely information .
we recommend the president 's press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences , " nogovitsyn said .
russians manning checkpoints along the tbilisi-gori road were permitting civilian and humanitarian traffic to pass , but were blocking " unscheduled " diplomats and media .
a russian national flag flew over the gori checkpoint .
georgia 's western region also saw substantial russian withdrawals on friday , with amour and infantry abandoning georgian government buildings in the centre of zugdidi , a town near the border with abkhazia , the georgian secessionist province loyal to moscow .
the western town of senaki , site of georgia 's largest air base , and the port of poti , on the black sea coast , had seen no reductions in russian occupation forces by early afternoon on friday .
russian forces rolled into georgia on august 8 to push back a georgian offensive to re-take control of its rebel south ossetia region , which won de facto autonomy in a civil war in the early 1990s .
russian troops also moved forward in georgia 's other breakaway region of abkhazia , and seized key strategic bases in georgia , including poti .

22 but were still operating checkpoints despite pledges to leave by the end of the day .
columns were reportedly headed for south ossetia and abkhazia . as the united nations again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict , russia finally began to withdraw , in line with a french-brokered plan , from the strongly pro-western ex-soviet republic .
the russian general staff said that troops were " in the final stage of pulling back , " but they would continue to hold buffer zones and maintain peacekeeping forces in the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .
the united states has criticized the planned buffer zone as a half-way measure that fails to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
russian armored columns were moving north from the central gori sector in south ossetia , but a defensive cordon remained in place with checkpoints outside gori and near the georgian village of igoeti .
troops heading for south ossetia and abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west and georgia say russia is dragging its heels twenty russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops were seen heading north from near the georgian city of gori toward the separatist region of south ossetia , reporters said .
the nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armored personnel carriers headed towards the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian troopers driving northward on the gori-tskhinvali road shouted " russia ! " and " we 're going home ! "
but reconnaissance , tank , and infantry peacekeepers operating checkpoints in the vicinity said they had not received orders to evacuate .
russian infantry were continuing to dig in on high ground overlooking a river bridge near igoeti .
fuel tankers were refueling tanks and armored personnel carriers , and supply lorries were delivering food and water to russian troops .
the russian military said 18 additional russian checkpoints were being set up as part of russian-controlled buffer zones along the borders between central georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia respectively .
a contingent of 2,142 russian peacekeeping forces would remain in abkhazia and 452 troops in south ossetia , colonel general nogovitsyn said .
russian forces would be out of georgia proper by 20:00 local time , he said .
criticism continues over delay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columns of troops are heading for the rebel regions aleksander lomia , georgia 's national security council head , in mid-afternoon gave tbilisi 's first official acknowledgement of the russian withdrawal , saying russian forces " were pulling out , but not fast enough , " according to an interfax report .
international criticism has mounted that moscow is delaying withdrawing its troops from georgian territory in accordance with a ceasefire that ended the 10-day conflict .
us president george w bush called for an end to the russian " siege " in a telephone conversation on thursday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , a us ally .
but russian military commanders brushed aside bush 's demands , saying they were complying with the peace accord .
" the president of the united states is on vacation .
obviously , he is not receiving timely information .
we recommend the president 's press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences , " nogovitsyn said .
russians manning checkpoints along the tbilisi-gori road were permitting civilian and humanitarian traffic to pass , but were blocking " unscheduled " diplomats and media .
a russian national flag flew over the gori checkpoint .
georgia 's western region also saw substantial russian withdrawals on friday , with amour and infantry abandoning georgian government buildings in the centre of zugdidi , a town near the border with abkhazia , the georgian secessionist province loyal to moscow .
the western town of senaki , site of georgia 's largest air base , and the port of poti , on the black sea coast , had seen no reductions in russian occupation forces by early afternoon on friday .
russian forces rolled into georgia on august 8 to push back a georgian offensive to re-take control of its rebel south ossetia region , which won de facto autonomy in a civil war in the early 1990s .
russian troops also moved forward in georgia 's other breakaway region of abkhazia , and seized key strategic bases in georgia , including poti .

on thursday , tens of thousands gathered in sukhumi , capital of abkhazia , to demand russian recognition of their independence .
over 1,000 people attended a similar rally in south ossetia 's main town and on friday , the south ossetia parliament formally asked russia to recognize its independence , ria novosti news agency reported .
moscow has hinted at giving both recognition in a move that would risk sparking one of the deepest crises between russia and the west since the cold war .
russia 's two houses of parliament are to discuss the issue monday .
the kremlin has suggested that kosovo serve as a precedent in international law for recognizing the two rebel regions ' bid for independence . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 but were still operating checkpoints despite pledges to leave by the end of the day .
columns were reportedly headed for south ossetia and abkhazia . as the united nations again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict , russia finally began to withdraw , in line with a french-brokered plan , from the strongly pro-western ex-soviet republic .
the russian general staff said that troops were " in the final stage of pulling back , " but they would continue to hold buffer zones and maintain peacekeeping forces in the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .
the united states has criticized the planned buffer zone as a half-way measure that fails to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
russian armored columns were moving north from the central gori sector in south ossetia , but a defensive cordon remained in place with checkpoints outside gori and near the georgian village of igoeti .
troops heading for south ossetia and abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west and georgia say russia is dragging its heels twenty russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops were seen heading north from near the georgian city of gori toward the separatist region of south ossetia , reporters said .
the nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armored personnel carriers headed towards the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian troopers driving northward on the gori-tskhinvali road shouted " russia ! " and " we 're going home ! "
but reconnaissance , tank , and infantry peacekeepers operating checkpoints in the vicinity said they had not received orders to evacuate .
russian infantry were continuing to dig in on high ground overlooking a river bridge near igoeti .
fuel tankers were refueling tanks and armored personnel carriers , and supply lorries were delivering food and water to russian troops .
the russian military said 18 additional russian checkpoints were being set up as part of russian-controlled buffer zones along the borders between central georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia respectively .
a contingent of 2,142 russian peacekeeping forces would remain in abkhazia and 452 troops in south ossetia , colonel general nogovitsyn said .
russian forces would be out of georgia proper by 20:00 local time , he said .
criticism continues over delay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columns of troops are heading for the rebel regions aleksander lomia , georgia 's national security council head , in mid-afternoon gave tbilisi 's first official acknowledgement of the russian withdrawal , saying russian forces " were pulling out , but not fast enough , " according to an interfax report .
international criticism has mounted that moscow is delaying withdrawing its troops from georgian territory in accordance with a ceasefire that ended the 10-day conflict .
us president george w bush called for an end to the russian " siege " in a telephone conversation on thursday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , a us ally .
but russian military commanders brushed aside bush 's demands , saying they were complying with the peace accord .
" the president of the united states is on vacation .
obviously , he is not receiving timely information .
we recommend the president 's press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences , " nogovitsyn said .
russians manning checkpoints along the tbilisi-gori road were permitting civilian and humanitarian traffic to pass , but were blocking " unscheduled " diplomats and media .
a russian national flag flew over the gori checkpoint .
georgia 's western region also saw substantial russian withdrawals on friday , with amour and infantry abandoning georgian government buildings in the centre of zugdidi , a town near the border with abkhazia , the georgian secessionist province loyal to moscow .
the western town of senaki , site of georgia 's largest air base , and the port of poti , on the black sea coast , had seen no reductions in russian occupation forces by early afternoon on friday .
russian forces rolled into georgia on august 8 to push back a georgian offensive to re-take control of its rebel south ossetia region , which won de facto autonomy in a civil war in the early 1990s .
russian troops also moved forward in georgia 's other breakaway region of abkhazia , and seized key strategic bases in georgia , including poti .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 22.08.2008 russia : 10 days needed for georgia pullout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians are now said to be pulling out of gori russia promised to withdraw most forces from deep inside georgia , but was set to retain a military presence in two separatist regions and a buffer zone .
troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .
however , in the interview with german public broadcaster ard on friday , he added that moscow 's use of force in georgia was " fully disproportionate " to the severity of the situation . buffer zone a point of contention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian president has rejected the idea of a buffer zone russian president dmitry medvedev has promised that all but 500 russian troops would be withdrawn from georgia by then . moscow said those remaining troops would be stationed in what it termed as " zone of responsibility " as part of a peacekeeping operation to protect south ossetia .
this would leave russian troops present inside the georgian heartland and close to its economically vital east-west highway .
boldryev made no reference those 500 troops in his remarks . georgian president mikhail saakashvili has said he would not stand for their presence . " there will be no buffer zones , " he told reuters news agency in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
" we will never live with any buffer zones .
we 'll never allow anything like this . " osce observers due monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee camp for georgians from south ossetia and gori meanwhile , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has announced that twenty of its observers will be ready to start monitoring a ceasefire between georgia and russia from monday .

troops will need 10 days for a full withdrawal , a commander said . defense minister anatoly serdyukov announced the pullout two weeks after tanks and troops poured into south ossetia to repel an attempt by georgia 's army to seize back control of the moscow-backed breakaway region . " on friday , august 22 , at 6:00 a.m. local time , all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia , " serdyukov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " over the course of august 22 , the retreat ... will be completed . " however , serdyukov said only advance troops posted deep inside georgia would be affected - not soldiers and heavy equipment in georgia 's rebel south ossetia and abkhazia regions . a senior russian commander has said a full withdrawal of regular russian forces back into home territory would require over a week . " they will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " itar-tass quoted general vladimir boldyrev , commander of russian ground forces in the region , as saying . ap news agency is reporting that while some tank columns have been rolling northwards home , some russian forces have dug trenches and built long-term fortifications in key areas of georgia . it was not immediately clear how the timetable announced by the general would square with a previous russian commitment to pull back its forces to behind a buffer zone around south ossetia by late friday . german defense minister franz josef jung said dialogue with russia has to be reopened after its troops are back on russian soil .
however , in the interview with german public broadcaster ard on friday , he added that moscow 's use of force in georgia was " fully disproportionate " to the severity of the situation . buffer zone a point of contention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian president has rejected the idea of a buffer zone russian president dmitry medvedev has promised that all but 500 russian troops would be withdrawn from georgia by then . moscow said those remaining troops would be stationed in what it termed as " zone of responsibility " as part of a peacekeeping operation to protect south ossetia .
this would leave russian troops present inside the georgian heartland and close to its economically vital east-west highway .
boldryev made no reference those 500 troops in his remarks . georgian president mikhail saakashvili has said he would not stand for their presence . " there will be no buffer zones , " he told reuters news agency in the georgian capital , tbilisi .

in total , baa runs seven british airports . the final decision over the future of the airports would be taken in april , said the commission , which had found that the undivided ownership of britain 's leading airports was having " adverse consequences " on air traffic for passengers and airlines . reacting to the report , baa chief colin matthews insisted the company would not sell heathrow , yet he conceded the watchdog 's findings on " poor service " and " frustration " for passengers . german firm watching baa situation in germany , essen-based company hochtief said it continued to have a " great interest " in gatwick , the uk 's second-largest airport . hochtief is germany 's largest construction company with subsidiaries in the us and australia . however , it remained unclear at this time when and under which conditions the company would get involved , a company spokeswoman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baa-owned stansted airport may be up for sale in the near future she said the company would also be interested in other baa airports should they become available .

the company is currently considering stakes in airports in riga , st. petersburg and prague . delays , service standards to blame baa , which belongs to spanish multinational grupo ferrovial , has come under pressure in recent years over delays and service standards at its airports .
the report especially blamed the company for slow responses to passenger concerns and the failure to expand its airports ' capacities . the company reacted by accusing the competition watchdog of errors in judgment and said an airport sale would be counterproductive . airlines including ryanair , virgin atlantic airways and easyjet welcomed the commission 's findings . british airport operator manchester airport group also expressed interest in one of the three london hubs , which process 90 percent of all air traffic into london . the group , which operates airports in manchester , bournemouth , east midlands and humberside , said it was considering " one or more " baa airports . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but demonizing russia wo n't help , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the georgian conflict significantly worsened the relationship between the nato countries of the west and russia .
signs of escalation on both sides are unmistakable . the nato-russia council will be suspended by the west until russian troops have pulled out from georgia proper .
as a countermove , russia is calling back its nato representatives and canceling all planned maneuvers with nato for 2008 . and that 's not all .
an agreement regarding a georgia resolution has not been achieved by the un security council , and in warsaw , americans and poles are signing an agreement to station a missile shield - a move that the russians perceive as a threat . a foreign policy rival the deterioration of the west 's relationship with russia is accompanied by heated social discussions in which poland and eastern central europe in particular are painting russia as an aggressive imperialistic power - as if the kremlin were on the verge of attacking the former soviet union or the warsaw pact states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel indeed , there is no doubt that the invasion of georgia proper by russian troops , as well as the air strikes on georgian targets outside of south ossetia , were excessive .
russia went too far .
and the us and eu states are rightfully asking that russia 's unacceptable overreaction now be corrected .
nevertheless , it is wrong to answer russia with an equally irrational reaction . it 's always been known that russia is and will remain a difficult partner .
russia already took over the job of protector state over abkhazia and south ossetia years ago .
saakashvili 's attempt to reconquer the separatist south ossetian region with military force was a dangerous undertaking from the outset and one that was destined to end in a political and humanitarian disaster . it borders on political naivite to believe that russia would act differently than it did . an uncomfortable partner now a clear realpolitik is needed with russia , without yielding to moscow in georgia .
georgia 's independence and territorial integrity must be protected .
europe 's interest in peace and stability requires it . at the same time , it does n't help to demonize russia now and practice a consequent policy of containment and orbit , because having a good relationship with russia is in our own interests when it comes to other issues . these include energy supply , iran 's nuclear program , the reconstruction of afghanistan , the middle east and the north korea conflict . the caucasus conflict should not be made into the lynchpin for the definition of the west 's relationship with russia .
consideration of russian interests in the caucasus conflict does n't have to mean submission to russian policy , but rather is an intelligent approach that is in europe 's best interest . and when it comes down to it , harsh realpolitik is the only thing russian politics understands . ingo mannteufel is the head of dw 's russian online and radio programs . -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the next us president will have to repair ties with russia . in a rare show of solidarity with the republican incumbent , democratic presidential hopeful obama said on thursday , aug .
21 , that he agreed with president george w. bush 's stance toward russia following the recent five-day conflict with georgia . " i 'm supportive of what george bush has been doing , " said obama , who disagrees with bush on most foreign policy issues .
" there will be a time later for politics .
i 'm a big believer that when you 're in a crisis , america speaks with one voice . " bush , who has nurtured positive personal relations with russian prime minister vladimir putin over the past eight years , has firmly denounced russia 's decision to send troops into georgia after the former soviet republic attacked the separatist region of south ossetia on aug .
8 . while the west has largely condemned russia 's military involvement in georgia , russia has sharply criticized georgia for attacking its breakaway provinces . new chapter in us-russia relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama agrees with bush - at least as far as the caucasus war is concerned the us president has insisted that georgia 's territorial sovereignty be respected .
the pro-russian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia have enjoyed de facto independence from georgia since the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 . nevertheless , the clash with russia has put the chill on us-russian relations . the conflict in the caucasus " indicates a new stage in the relationship between russia and the west , " said obama thursday .
" we 've got to be firm with the russians , in alliance with our european allies , that this kind of behavior is intolerable . " both obama and republican presidential hopeful john mccain have warned russia of severe , long-term consequences from its conflict with georgia . the united states is caught somewhat between a rock and a hard place as it is dependent on russia 's approval in the united nations security council , where moscow enjoys veto power , on a number of international issues . georgia becomes presidential battlefield mccain , who is slightly behind obama in polls , has used the russian-georgian conflict to draw attention to his extensive foreign policy experience .
a vietnam veteran , former prisoner of war , and long-time us senator , mccain has said he is better suited than his significantly younger opponent to take on the position of commander-in-chief . obama , a first-term senator from illinois with no military experience , recently made a highly publicized tour of europe in an effort to boost his image on the foreign policy front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain , seen here with us troops in iraq , said his military experience better qualifies him mccain has gone beyond the white house 's stance in his response to russia in light of the fighting in georgia , demanding that russia be expelled from the group of eight highly industrialized nations , at least for a time .

but the next us president will have to repair ties with russia . in a rare show of solidarity with the republican incumbent , democratic presidential hopeful obama said on thursday , aug .

" there will be a time later for politics .
i 'm a big believer that when you 're in a crisis , america speaks with one voice . " bush , who has nurtured positive personal relations with russian prime minister vladimir putin over the past eight years , has firmly denounced russia 's decision to send troops into georgia after the former soviet republic attacked the separatist region of south ossetia on aug .

while working for the government of east germany , he made the transfer of over 250,000 people out of the gdr possible .
vogel also arranged the exchange of almost 34,000 political prisoners between the east and west . during the height of the cold war in the late 50s , vogel was the only point man between the west german government in bonn and the communist gdr in east berlin .

vogel 's reach inside the east german government was so extensive that when former chancellor helmut schmidt wanted to visit the country , it was vogel who helped arrange it .
schmidt later dubbed vogel “ our mail man ” .
after the fall of the berlin wall , vogel admitted that he also worked for the stasi , east germany ’ s secret police .
he was accused of blackmailing people who wanted to leave the gdr , and for selling real estate at well below market value .
however , in 1998 he was cleared of those charges by the german federal supreme court . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the harsh penalty has drawn hefty criticism , particularly from washington . florian norbu gyanatshang , a 30-year-old tibetan-german from stuttgart , was among those being held in beijing .
head of the german chapter of the tibetan youth association in europe , the software developer was arrested on thursday , aug .
21 , for unfurling a tibetan flag near the olympic stadium in the chinese capital . " as a german citizen , i can not remain silent at the blatant human rights violations that are occurring in tibet , " he said in a statement published in germany after his arrest .
" and as a tibetan , i would like to stand by my fellow countrymen in this difficult situation . " two americans and one briton were arrested with gyanatshang for disturbing the " public order . "
chinese police said on friday that they had detained another six us activists for 10 days . ten-day detention is the harshest treatment so far of tibet activists since a series of demonstrations in the capital during the olympics .
chinese law allows police to force people to undergo administrative detention without trial .
dozens of other protesters have been deported shortly after their arrest during the games . us urges human rights standards the six americans most recently detained were believed to be from the us-based group students for a free tibet , which had held eight pro-tibet protests in beijing since aug .
6 . " these people of conscience from many walks of life were here to make sure the tibetan issue was at the forefront during these olympics games , " kate woznow , the group 's campaign director , told dpa news agency . a spokeswoman for the us embassy in beijing told dpa that the embassy was aware of the detainments , but she could not provide details due to privacy concerns . " we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights , including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond , " said spokeswoman susan stevenson . " these rights are protected by china 's own constitution and international human rights standards to which china has agreed .

his widow , helga , said that vogel had not been well after suffering a heart attack earlier in this year . the former lawyer was best known for his work as a german to german negotiator .
while working for the government of east germany , he made the transfer of over 250,000 people out of the gdr possible .
vogel also arranged the exchange of almost 34,000 political prisoners between the east and west . during the height of the cold war in the late 50s , vogel was the only point man between the west german government in bonn and the communist gdr in east berlin .
at the time both sides claimed to have no official contact . negotiating for super powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vogel oversaw the exchange of kgb spy abel and american pilot powers vogel gained a sense of acclaim , if not notoriety , for overseeing the exchange of kgb spy rudolf j. abel for gary powers in 1962 .

ironically , at the time , the span was known as the ‘ bridge of unity ’ , even though it only served the allies as a border crossing .
vogel 's reach inside the east german government was so extensive that when former chancellor helmut schmidt wanted to visit the country , it was vogel who helped arrange it .
schmidt later dubbed vogel “ our mail man ” .
after the fall of the berlin wall , vogel admitted that he also worked for the stasi , east germany ’ s secret police .
he was accused of blackmailing people who wanted to leave the gdr , and for selling real estate at well below market value .
however , in 1998 he was cleared of those charges by the german federal supreme court . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and though they 're too young to remember the cold war , they still feel the old grievances . mariam sits in the main garden outside the university in bonn , germany .
it 's a warm august evening and the sun has just set .
mariam does n't notice .
she is too caught up in the thoughts running through her mind .
mariam , a university student , says she is afraid every day .
afraid for her family and her country . " each day i call my mother in tbilisi and if she does n't answer i am totally overcome by fear .
i 'm convinced that a russian bomb landed on our house , " she says . rage towards russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariam fears for her family 's safety for the past four years mariam has lived in germany , studying economics .
she would like to return to her homeland , but at the moment she does n't dare .
she and her georgian friends follow the unrest in her native country on the television and the internet . mariam and her sister , mtvarisa , are furious with russia and the russian president .
mtvarisa says that russia just can not deal with the fact that georgia is developing in a western fashion . georgia has a very strategic position .
gas and oil pipelines pass through our country , and of course the russians want to control them , she adds . " we have to defend ourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers are out in full force against the russians nino also firmly believes in her country and the georgian president .

it sounds like something memorized at a young age .
nino has been in germany for a year , and is waiting for a spot to open up for her to study medicine . she has just turned 20 .
she never experienced the cold war .
nevertheless , even she feels some of the old hatred when she sees the former frontlines re-outlined : east against west , russia against america - and georgia in the middle , sitting on the fence .
georgia is like a buffer state with an overpowering adversary standing at the door . enemies at the disco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nino completely supports her government for the young georgians , a russian is someone to hate , not to have as a friend .
that 's how it 's always been .
because of that , nino could never imagine herself falling in love with a russian boy , not even here in germany . " after everything that has happened between our countries , it is n't possible anymore , " she says defensively , shaking her head . the young georgian has brought this hate , anger and fear with her to germany .
luckily there are n't any russians living in her dormitory , she says .
though she came across a few in the street one evening recently .
a couple of russian students who were looking for a disco asked nino and mariam if they knew where one was . mariam recognized the accent immediately .
when she and nino told the russians where they were from , the mood darkened , she explains . " and when they asked where we were from , and we told them that we 're georgians , they became aggressive .
one boy screamed : ' russia will kill georgia ' .
i said , you are our enemies , but we will gladly help you find a disco , " she says . " there is no peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian soldiers have still not withdrawn from the country the only solution is for the russians to leave , agree the two students .
they are afraid that russia will simply annex georgia and remove the government . " i could never live under a russian government , " says mariam .
" i am georgian and proud of it . " " there is no peace , " says nino , " the war is over , but the people are still afraid of the russians .
they are still in georgia and refuse to leave .
they ’ re aiming their rockets at tbilisi . " " m-schwi-do-ba " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtvarisa , nino , tamta und mariam occasionally the students have doubts about their hatred for russia , though it 's rare .
sometimes they meet russians who are actually very nice .
like the woman at the language course at the community college .
mariam quickly became friends with this potential enemy .
it didn ’ t last .
" the politics destroyed our friendship , " she says , sadly . because despite all the anger , the georgian students only want one thing : " m-shvi-do-ba , " they say .

it 's a warm august evening and the sun has just set .

and though they 're too young to remember the cold war , they still feel the old grievances . mariam sits in the main garden outside the university in bonn , germany .
it 's a warm august evening and the sun has just set .
mariam does n't notice .
she is too caught up in the thoughts running through her mind .
mariam , a university student , says she is afraid every day .
afraid for her family and her country . " each day i call my mother in tbilisi and if she does n't answer i am totally overcome by fear .
i 'm convinced that a russian bomb landed on our house , " she says . rage towards russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariam fears for her family 's safety for the past four years mariam has lived in germany , studying economics .
she would like to return to her homeland , but at the moment she does n't dare .
she and her georgian friends follow the unrest in her native country on the television and the internet . mariam and her sister , mtvarisa , are furious with russia and the russian president .
mtvarisa says that russia just can not deal with the fact that georgia is developing in a western fashion . georgia has a very strategic position .
gas and oil pipelines pass through our country , and of course the russians want to control them , she adds . " we have to defend ourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers are out in full force against the russians nino also firmly believes in her country and the georgian president .
she finds saakashvili 's actions commendable .
" we have to defend ourselves , " she says .
it sounds like something memorized at a young age .
nino has been in germany for a year , and is waiting for a spot to open up for her to study medicine . she has just turned 20 .
she never experienced the cold war .
nevertheless , even she feels some of the old hatred when she sees the former frontlines re-outlined : east against west , russia against america - and georgia in the middle , sitting on the fence .
georgia is like a buffer state with an overpowering adversary standing at the door . enemies at the disco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nino completely supports her government for the young georgians , a russian is someone to hate , not to have as a friend .
that 's how it 's always been .
because of that , nino could never imagine herself falling in love with a russian boy , not even here in germany . " after everything that has happened between our countries , it is n't possible anymore , " she says defensively , shaking her head . the young georgian has brought this hate , anger and fear with her to germany .
luckily there are n't any russians living in her dormitory , she says .
though she came across a few in the street one evening recently .
a couple of russian students who were looking for a disco asked nino and mariam if they knew where one was . mariam recognized the accent immediately .
when she and nino told the russians where they were from , the mood darkened , she explains . " and when they asked where we were from , and we told them that we 're georgians , they became aggressive .
one boy screamed : ' russia will kill georgia ' .
i said , you are our enemies , but we will gladly help you find a disco , " she says . " there is no peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian soldiers have still not withdrawn from the country the only solution is for the russians to leave , agree the two students .
they are afraid that russia will simply annex georgia and remove the government . " i could never live under a russian government , " says mariam .
" i am georgian and proud of it . " " there is no peace , " says nino , " the war is over , but the people are still afraid of the russians .
they are still in georgia and refuse to leave .
they ’ re aiming their rockets at tbilisi . " " m-schwi-do-ba " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtvarisa , nino , tamta und mariam occasionally the students have doubts about their hatred for russia , though it 's rare .
sometimes they meet russians who are actually very nice .
like the woman at the language course at the community college .
mariam quickly became friends with this potential enemy .
it didn ’ t last .
" the politics destroyed our friendship , " she says , sadly . because despite all the anger , the georgian students only want one thing : " m-shvi-do-ba , " they say .
it 's georgian , and it means peace . anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this was despite a security situation in iraq which was characterized by daily attacks as well as precarious living conditions and the lack of an effective authority in some parts of the country . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chinese police said on friday that they had detained another six us activists for 10 days . ten-day detention is the harshest treatment so far of tibet activists since a series of demonstrations in the capital during the olympics .

22 but were still operating checkpoints despite pledges to leave by the end of the day .
columns were reportedly headed for south ossetia and abkhazia . as the united nations again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict , russia finally began to withdraw , in line with a french-brokered plan , from the strongly pro-western ex-soviet republic .
the russian general staff said that troops were " in the final stage of pulling back , " but they would continue to hold buffer zones and maintain peacekeeping forces in the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .
the united states has criticized the planned buffer zone as a half-way measure that fails to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
russian armored columns were moving north from the central gori sector in south ossetia , but a defensive cordon remained in place with checkpoints outside gori and near the georgian village of igoeti .
troops heading for south ossetia and abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west and georgia say russia is dragging its heels twenty russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops were seen heading north from near the georgian city of gori toward the separatist region of south ossetia , reporters said .
the nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armored personnel carriers headed towards the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian troopers driving northward on the gori-tskhinvali road shouted " russia ! " and " we 're going home ! "
but reconnaissance , tank , and infantry peacekeepers operating checkpoints in the vicinity said they had not received orders to evacuate .
russian infantry were continuing to dig in on high ground overlooking a river bridge near igoeti .
fuel tankers were refueling tanks and armored personnel carriers , and supply lorries were delivering food and water to russian troops .
the russian military said 18 additional russian checkpoints were being set up as part of russian-controlled buffer zones along the borders between central georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia respectively .
a contingent of 2,142 russian peacekeeping forces would remain in abkhazia and 452 troops in south ossetia , colonel general nogovitsyn said .
russian forces would be out of georgia proper by 20:00 local time , he said .
criticism continues over delay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columns of troops are heading for the rebel regions aleksander lomia , georgia 's national security council head , in mid-afternoon gave tbilisi 's first official acknowledgement of the russian withdrawal , saying russian forces " were pulling out , but not fast enough , " according to an interfax report .
international criticism has mounted that moscow is delaying withdrawing its troops from georgian territory in accordance with a ceasefire that ended the 10-day conflict .
us president george w bush called for an end to the russian " siege " in a telephone conversation on thursday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , a us ally .
but russian military commanders brushed aside bush 's demands , saying they were complying with the peace accord .
" the president of the united states is on vacation .
obviously , he is not receiving timely information .
we recommend the president 's press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences , " nogovitsyn said .
russians manning checkpoints along the tbilisi-gori road were permitting civilian and humanitarian traffic to pass , but were blocking " unscheduled " diplomats and media .
a russian national flag flew over the gori checkpoint .
georgia 's western region also saw substantial russian withdrawals on friday , with amour and infantry abandoning georgian government buildings in the centre of zugdidi , a town near the border with abkhazia , the georgian secessionist province loyal to moscow .
the western town of senaki , site of georgia 's largest air base , and the port of poti , on the black sea coast , had seen no reductions in russian occupation forces by early afternoon on friday .
russian forces rolled into georgia on august 8 to push back a georgian offensive to re-take control of its rebel south ossetia region , which won de facto autonomy in a civil war in the early 1990s .
russian troops also moved forward in georgia 's other breakaway region of abkhazia , and seized key strategic bases in georgia , including poti .

but the next us president will have to repair ties with russia . in a rare show of solidarity with the republican incumbent , democratic presidential hopeful obama said on thursday , aug .
21 , that he agreed with president george w. bush 's stance toward russia following the recent five-day conflict with georgia . " i 'm supportive of what george bush has been doing , " said obama , who disagrees with bush on most foreign policy issues .
" there will be a time later for politics .
i 'm a big believer that when you 're in a crisis , america speaks with one voice . " bush , who has nurtured positive personal relations with russian prime minister vladimir putin over the past eight years , has firmly denounced russia 's decision to send troops into georgia after the former soviet republic attacked the separatist region of south ossetia on aug .
8 . while the west has largely condemned russia 's military involvement in georgia , russia has sharply criticized georgia for attacking its breakaway provinces . new chapter in us-russia relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama agrees with bush - at least as far as the caucasus war is concerned the us president has insisted that georgia 's territorial sovereignty be respected .
the pro-russian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia have enjoyed de facto independence from georgia since the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 . nevertheless , the clash with russia has put the chill on us-russian relations . the conflict in the caucasus " indicates a new stage in the relationship between russia and the west , " said obama thursday .
" we 've got to be firm with the russians , in alliance with our european allies , that this kind of behavior is intolerable . " both obama and republican presidential hopeful john mccain have warned russia of severe , long-term consequences from its conflict with georgia . the united states is caught somewhat between a rock and a hard place as it is dependent on russia 's approval in the united nations security council , where moscow enjoys veto power , on a number of international issues . georgia becomes presidential battlefield mccain , who is slightly behind obama in polls , has used the russian-georgian conflict to draw attention to his extensive foreign policy experience .
a vietnam veteran , former prisoner of war , and long-time us senator , mccain has said he is better suited than his significantly younger opponent to take on the position of commander-in-chief . obama , a first-term senator from illinois with no military experience , recently made a highly publicized tour of europe in an effort to boost his image on the foreign policy front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain , seen here with us troops in iraq , said his military experience better qualifies him mccain has gone beyond the white house 's stance in his response to russia in light of the fighting in georgia , demanding that russia be expelled from the group of eight highly industrialized nations , at least for a time .

but the next us president will have to repair ties with russia . in a rare show of solidarity with the republican incumbent , democratic presidential hopeful obama said on thursday , aug .
21 , that he agreed with president george w. bush 's stance toward russia following the recent five-day conflict with georgia . " i 'm supportive of what george bush has been doing , " said obama , who disagrees with bush on most foreign policy issues .
" there will be a time later for politics .
i 'm a big believer that when you 're in a crisis , america speaks with one voice . " bush , who has nurtured positive personal relations with russian prime minister vladimir putin over the past eight years , has firmly denounced russia 's decision to send troops into georgia after the former soviet republic attacked the separatist region of south ossetia on aug .
8 . while the west has largely condemned russia 's military involvement in georgia , russia has sharply criticized georgia for attacking its breakaway provinces . new chapter in us-russia relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama agrees with bush - at least as far as the caucasus war is concerned the us president has insisted that georgia 's territorial sovereignty be respected .
the pro-russian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia have enjoyed de facto independence from georgia since the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 . nevertheless , the clash with russia has put the chill on us-russian relations . the conflict in the caucasus " indicates a new stage in the relationship between russia and the west , " said obama thursday .
" we 've got to be firm with the russians , in alliance with our european allies , that this kind of behavior is intolerable . " both obama and republican presidential hopeful john mccain have warned russia of severe , long-term consequences from its conflict with georgia . the united states is caught somewhat between a rock and a hard place as it is dependent on russia 's approval in the united nations security council , where moscow enjoys veto power , on a number of international issues . georgia becomes presidential battlefield mccain , who is slightly behind obama in polls , has used the russian-georgian conflict to draw attention to his extensive foreign policy experience .
a vietnam veteran , former prisoner of war , and long-time us senator , mccain has said he is better suited than his significantly younger opponent to take on the position of commander-in-chief . obama , a first-term senator from illinois with no military experience , recently made a highly publicized tour of europe in an effort to boost his image on the foreign policy front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain , seen here with us troops in iraq , said his military experience better qualifies him mccain has gone beyond the white house 's stance in his response to russia in light of the fighting in georgia , demanding that russia be expelled from the group of eight highly industrialized nations , at least for a time .
he has also expressed opposition to russian membership in the world trade organization . " in matters of national security , good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president - as we were all reminded ... by the events in the nation of georgia , " said mccain earlier this week . advice from all sides obama promised thursday , addressing supporters in virginia , to call on the " best and brightest " foreign policy advisors , should he be elected .

22 but were still operating checkpoints despite pledges to leave by the end of the day .
columns were reportedly headed for south ossetia and abkhazia . as the united nations again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict , russia finally began to withdraw , in line with a french-brokered plan , from the strongly pro-western ex-soviet republic .
the russian general staff said that troops were " in the final stage of pulling back , " but they would continue to hold buffer zones and maintain peacekeeping forces in the two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
" the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal , " russian deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovitsyn said in moscow , rejecting western criticism of the slow pace of the withdrawal .
the united states has criticized the planned buffer zone as a half-way measure that fails to comply with the ceasefire agreement .
russian armored columns were moving north from the central gori sector in south ossetia , but a defensive cordon remained in place with checkpoints outside gori and near the georgian village of igoeti .
troops heading for south ossetia and abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west and georgia say russia is dragging its heels twenty russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops were seen heading north from near the georgian city of gori toward the separatist region of south ossetia , reporters said .
the nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armored personnel carriers headed towards the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
russian troopers driving northward on the gori-tskhinvali road shouted " russia ! " and " we 're going home ! "
but reconnaissance , tank , and infantry peacekeepers operating checkpoints in the vicinity said they had not received orders to evacuate .
russian infantry were continuing to dig in on high ground overlooking a river bridge near igoeti .
fuel tankers were refueling tanks and armored personnel carriers , and supply lorries were delivering food and water to russian troops .
the russian military said 18 additional russian checkpoints were being set up as part of russian-controlled buffer zones along the borders between central georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia respectively .
a contingent of 2,142 russian peacekeeping forces would remain in abkhazia and 452 troops in south ossetia , colonel general nogovitsyn said .
russian forces would be out of georgia proper by 20:00 local time , he said .
criticism continues over delay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : columns of troops are heading for the rebel regions aleksander lomia , georgia 's national security council head , in mid-afternoon gave tbilisi 's first official acknowledgement of the russian withdrawal , saying russian forces " were pulling out , but not fast enough , " according to an interfax report .
international criticism has mounted that moscow is delaying withdrawing its troops from georgian territory in accordance with a ceasefire that ended the 10-day conflict .
us president george w bush called for an end to the russian " siege " in a telephone conversation on thursday with georgian president mikheil saakashvili , a us ally .
but russian military commanders brushed aside bush 's demands , saying they were complying with the peace accord .
" the president of the united states is on vacation .
obviously , he is not receiving timely information .
we recommend the president 's press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences , " nogovitsyn said .
russians manning checkpoints along the tbilisi-gori road were permitting civilian and humanitarian traffic to pass , but were blocking " unscheduled " diplomats and media .
a russian national flag flew over the gori checkpoint .
georgia 's western region also saw substantial russian withdrawals on friday , with amour and infantry abandoning georgian government buildings in the centre of zugdidi , a town near the border with abkhazia , the georgian secessionist province loyal to moscow .
the western town of senaki , site of georgia 's largest air base , and the port of poti , on the black sea coast , had seen no reductions in russian occupation forces by early afternoon on friday .
russian forces rolled into georgia on august 8 to push back a georgian offensive to re-take control of its rebel south ossetia region , which won de facto autonomy in a civil war in the early 1990s .
russian troops also moved forward in georgia 's other breakaway region of abkhazia , and seized key strategic bases in georgia , including poti .

on thursday , tens of thousands gathered in sukhumi , capital of abkhazia , to demand russian recognition of their independence .
over 1,000 people attended a similar rally in south ossetia 's main town and on friday , the south ossetia parliament formally asked russia to recognize its independence , ria novosti news agency reported .
moscow has hinted at giving both recognition in a move that would risk sparking one of the deepest crises between russia and the west since the cold war .
russia 's two houses of parliament are to discuss the issue monday .

the harsh penalty has drawn hefty criticism , particularly from washington . florian norbu gyanatshang , a 30-year-old tibetan-german from stuttgart , was among those being held in beijing .
head of the german chapter of the tibetan youth association in europe , the software developer was arrested on thursday , aug .
21 , for unfurling a tibetan flag near the olympic stadium in the chinese capital . " as a german citizen , i can not remain silent at the blatant human rights violations that are occurring in tibet , " he said in a statement published in germany after his arrest .
" and as a tibetan , i would like to stand by my fellow countrymen in this difficult situation . " two americans and one briton were arrested with gyanatshang for disturbing the " public order . "
chinese police said on friday that they had detained another six us activists for 10 days . ten-day detention is the harshest treatment so far of tibet activists since a series of demonstrations in the capital during the olympics .
chinese law allows police to force people to undergo administrative detention without trial .
dozens of other protesters have been deported shortly after their arrest during the games . us urges human rights standards the six americans most recently detained were believed to be from the us-based group students for a free tibet , which had held eight pro-tibet protests in beijing since aug .
6 . " these people of conscience from many walks of life were here to make sure the tibetan issue was at the forefront during these olympics games , " kate woznow , the group 's campaign director , told dpa news agency . a spokeswoman for the us embassy in beijing told dpa that the embassy was aware of the detainments , but she could not provide details due to privacy concerns . " we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights , including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond , " said spokeswoman susan stevenson . " these rights are protected by china 's own constitution and international human rights standards to which china has agreed . " when asked about the detentions and other human rights issues , chinese olympic organizing committee vice-president wang wie said western media were showing a bias against china and lack of knowledge about the country at a press conference on friday . " history will show that awarding the games to china was the correct decision , " he told reporters , adding that they should " write the truth .

and though they 're too young to remember the cold war , they still feel the old grievances . mariam sits in the main garden outside the university in bonn , germany .
it 's a warm august evening and the sun has just set .
mariam does n't notice .
she is too caught up in the thoughts running through her mind .
mariam , a university student , says she is afraid every day .
afraid for her family and her country . " each day i call my mother in tbilisi and if she does n't answer i am totally overcome by fear .
i 'm convinced that a russian bomb landed on our house , " she says . rage towards russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariam fears for her family 's safety for the past four years mariam has lived in germany , studying economics .
she would like to return to her homeland , but at the moment she does n't dare .
she and her georgian friends follow the unrest in her native country on the television and the internet . mariam and her sister , mtvarisa , are furious with russia and the russian president .
mtvarisa says that russia just can not deal with the fact that georgia is developing in a western fashion . georgia has a very strategic position .
gas and oil pipelines pass through our country , and of course the russians want to control them , she adds . " we have to defend ourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers are out in full force against the russians nino also firmly believes in her country and the georgian president .
she finds saakashvili 's actions commendable .
" we have to defend ourselves , " she says .
it sounds like something memorized at a young age .
nino has been in germany for a year , and is waiting for a spot to open up for her to study medicine . she has just turned 20 .
she never experienced the cold war .
nevertheless , even she feels some of the old hatred when she sees the former frontlines re-outlined : east against west , russia against america - and georgia in the middle , sitting on the fence .
georgia is like a buffer state with an overpowering adversary standing at the door . enemies at the disco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nino completely supports her government for the young georgians , a russian is someone to hate , not to have as a friend .
that 's how it 's always been .
because of that , nino could never imagine herself falling in love with a russian boy , not even here in germany . " after everything that has happened between our countries , it is n't possible anymore , " she says defensively , shaking her head . the young georgian has brought this hate , anger and fear with her to germany .
luckily there are n't any russians living in her dormitory , she says .
though she came across a few in the street one evening recently .
a couple of russian students who were looking for a disco asked nino and mariam if they knew where one was . mariam recognized the accent immediately .
when she and nino told the russians where they were from , the mood darkened , she explains . " and when they asked where we were from , and we told them that we 're georgians , they became aggressive .
one boy screamed : ' russia will kill georgia ' .
i said , you are our enemies , but we will gladly help you find a disco , " she says . " there is no peace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian soldiers have still not withdrawn from the country the only solution is for the russians to leave , agree the two students .
they are afraid that russia will simply annex georgia and remove the government . " i could never live under a russian government , " says mariam .
" i am georgian and proud of it . " " there is no peace , " says nino , " the war is over , but the people are still afraid of the russians .
they are still in georgia and refuse to leave .
they ’ re aiming their rockets at tbilisi . " " m-schwi-do-ba " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtvarisa , nino , tamta und mariam occasionally the students have doubts about their hatred for russia , though it 's rare .
sometimes they meet russians who are actually very nice .
like the woman at the language course at the community college .
mariam quickly became friends with this potential enemy .
it didn ’ t last .
" the politics destroyed our friendship , " she says , sadly . because despite all the anger , the georgian students only want one thing : " m-shvi-do-ba , " they say .
it 's georgian , and it means peace . anna kuhn-osius -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

stonewall cymru believes attacks on gay , lesbian and bisexual people in wales are underreported .
the gay rights group has worked with north wales police to produced a guide for victims of homophobic hate crime .
a spokesperson said : " it 's essential for victims of homophobic hate crime to understand that criminal justice agencies are there to help them . "
the guide is launched at the inter change , old colwyn , at an event to be attended by north wales police chief constable richard brunstrom and social justice minster brian gibbons .
the event includes a theatre piece written by gruffudd jones based on a true life experience of homophobic hate crime .
rachel , who has lived in small village near swansea for the past seven years , said her experience showed people can benefit from reporting hate crime .
a number of asbos were issued - it has sent out a very strong clear signal to the young people in the community hate crime victim , rachel she said : " at times i think were seen as an easy target who can be picked on .
i suppose the presumption is that nobody will stick up for us and that we 're fair game .
" to begin with , i did n't go to the police about some of these things .
it did n't occur to me there was any law against the name-calling .
i did n't think i would get a sympathetic hearing from the police .
" a lot of my friends who are lesbian and gay told me of negative experiences that they 've had when they tried reporting crime .
there tends to be this negative idea in the community and it puts people off . "
she said she had no response from the police one winter when young boys began throwing snowballs with stones in them at her windows .
she said : " the same boys came and did ' mooning ' .
then , again , they were throwing stones .
' arson attack ' " they put some handfuls of potential flammable rubbish through the letterbox .
the local secondary school was burnt to the ground not very far from where we were living and it made me very frightened at that time that we might be at risk of an arson attack .
" it was at that point that i involved the hate crime officers .
from that point on , i felt as if the service we were receiving from the police improved enormously .
" the fire service came and assess the fire safety of the house and the police started to take us more seriously , really and to pursue the culprits more effectively .
" a number of asbos were issued .
it has sent out a very strong clear signal to the young people in the community .

the average rate on a two-year fixed deal is now 6.59 % - almost the same as 6.56 % in august 2007 and down from 7.08 % in early july .
however , the costs associated with mortgages remain high , moneyfacts said .
the better rates are only available to those with big deposits and lenders are also charging higher fees .
moneyfacts said that the average mortgage arrangement fee was now £ 964 compared with £ 803 in august 2007 .
furthermore , there is less competition in the marketplace , with only 3,748 products on offer compared with 13,027 in august 2007 .
borrowers are also required to put down much higher deposits than a year ago .
an average of 20 % is now the norm , moneyfacts says .
" the pricing is getting back to where we were a year ago , but the appetite for lending is diminished , " said darren cook , a spokesman for moneyfacts .
better margins while the rates are at similar levels , banks are potentially making more profits on mortgages than a year ago .
official interest rates , on which fixed mortgage rates are indirectly based , are now 5 % compared with 5.75 % in august 2007 , which means lenders are getting better returns on the products offered .
last summer 33 lenders were offering borrowers 100 % mortgages compared with just two lenders in august this year .
abbey , nationwide and hbos have been among the lenders that have been cutting their rates .
lending to homeowners has slumped dramatically in 2008 , because the credit crunch has dried up the supply of funds available to banks .

the average rate on a two-year fixed deal is now 6.59 % - almost the same as 6.56 % in august 2007 and down from 7.08 % in early july .
however , the costs associated with mortgages remain high , moneyfacts said .
the better rates are only available to those with big deposits and lenders are also charging higher fees .
moneyfacts said that the average mortgage arrangement fee was now £ 964 compared with £ 803 in august 2007 .
furthermore , there is less competition in the marketplace , with only 3,748 products on offer compared with 13,027 in august 2007 .
borrowers are also required to put down much higher deposits than a year ago .
an average of 20 % is now the norm , moneyfacts says .
" the pricing is getting back to where we were a year ago , but the appetite for lending is diminished , " said darren cook , a spokesman for moneyfacts .
better margins while the rates are at similar levels , banks are potentially making more profits on mortgages than a year ago .
official interest rates , on which fixed mortgage rates are indirectly based , are now 5 % compared with 5.75 % in august 2007 , which means lenders are getting better returns on the products offered .
last summer 33 lenders were offering borrowers 100 % mortgages compared with just two lenders in august this year .
abbey , nationwide and hbos have been among the lenders that have been cutting their rates .
lending to homeowners has slumped dramatically in 2008 , because the credit crunch has dried up the supply of funds available to banks .

mr calderon has deployed more than 30,000 soldiers across the country since 2007 , in an effort to combat drug trafficking and drug-related violence .

russia fought a four-day war with georgia after it tried to retake the moscow-backed breakaway province of south ossetia on 7 august , following days of clashes with separatists .
the counter-offensive by russia , which has had peacekeeping troops in south ossetia since the early 1990s , took its troops beyond the province into georgia 's heartland .
president saakashvili told the bbc 's today programme georgia would never accept what he called russia 's " annexation of its territory " .
he renewed claims that russia had been planning to invade georgia long before tbilisi 's own assault on south ossetia .
he also warned that russia 's involvement in south ossetia , abkhazia and georgia were intended to send a strong message to the west .
" if nato fails now to come up with a united response , nobody 's safe , even if they are in nato already , " he said .
" it 's all about reconsidering the role of nato , the role of international law and borders in this part of the world .
this is no longer about georgia anymore .
" russia decided to win war with nato without firing a single shot at it . "
rival resolutions there is no sign of agreement over the rival resolutions , one backed by russia and the other by western european countries and the us , the bbc 's laura trevelyan reports from new york .
a top us general is in tbilisi to inspect the damage to georgia 's army france circulated a draft resolution on tuesday , calling for an immediate russian withdrawal from georgia and reaffirming georgia 's territorial integrity .
russia rejected this because it said georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia wanted independence .
moscow circulated its own draft calling on the security council to endorse the six-point peace plan brokered by france and agreed by moscow and tbilisi .
" our draft resolution is a reconfirmation of the six-point agreement , and there 's no territorial integrity in the six principles , " said russia 's un ambassador , vitaly churkin .
some elderly georgians were evacuated from s ossetia on thursday now russia 's ambassador says his resolution is going into its final form , so it can be voted on .
but the us and its allies insist russia is not respecting the ceasefire plan because it is not withdrawing from georgia quickly enough .
the us deputy ambassador to the un , alejandro wolff , said under the circumstances he thought america would be prepared to oppose russia 's resolution .
russia 's land forces commander , gen vladimir boldyrev , has said all russian combat troops will move back from georgia proper to south ossetia by the weekend .
most of the soldiers sent to the region as reinforcements will return from south ossetia to russia within 10 days , he added .
however , moscow will retain 500 peacekeepers in a security zone stretching 7km -lrb- four miles -rrb- beyond the border of south ossetia into georgia proper - a move tbilisi says is unacceptable .

washington says it is prepared to veto a russian resolution seeking to implement a six-point ceasefire plan .
russia has reiterated its opposition to a rival french text reaffirming georgia 's territorial integrity .
russian says its troops will leave georgia on friday but 500 will stay in a " buffer zone " around south ossetia .
local reports suggest russian troops are still dug in at positions inside georgia , but there has been some movement around the town of gori , which russia has promised to leave by 1600 gmt .
" they are going , but extremely slowly , " vova djugali , police chief at the nearby village of igoeti , told afp news agency .
meanwhile , a nato spokeswoman says russia 's defence ministry has decided to halt all military co-operation with the bloc to protest at what moscow calls the alliance 's biased , pro-georgian view of the conflict .
the move by moscow followed a nato statement that there would be no " business as usual " with moscow unless its troops pulled out of georgia .
a white house spokesman said president george w bush expected russia " to abide by its agreement to withdraw forces " .

more from today programme georgian president mikhail saakashvili has told the bbc the russians are still consolidating their hold on parts of his country , and he again accused them of trying to paralyse the georgian economy .
russia fought a four-day war with georgia after it tried to retake the moscow-backed breakaway province of south ossetia on 7 august , following days of clashes with separatists .
the counter-offensive by russia , which has had peacekeeping troops in south ossetia since the early 1990s , took its troops beyond the province into georgia 's heartland .
president saakashvili told the bbc 's today programme georgia would never accept what he called russia 's " annexation of its territory " .
he renewed claims that russia had been planning to invade georgia long before tbilisi 's own assault on south ossetia .
he also warned that russia 's involvement in south ossetia , abkhazia and georgia were intended to send a strong message to the west .
" if nato fails now to come up with a united response , nobody 's safe , even if they are in nato already , " he said .
" it 's all about reconsidering the role of nato , the role of international law and borders in this part of the world .
this is no longer about georgia anymore .
" russia decided to win war with nato without firing a single shot at it . "
rival resolutions there is no sign of agreement over the rival resolutions , one backed by russia and the other by western european countries and the us , the bbc 's laura trevelyan reports from new york .
a top us general is in tbilisi to inspect the damage to georgia 's army france circulated a draft resolution on tuesday , calling for an immediate russian withdrawal from georgia and reaffirming georgia 's territorial integrity .
russia rejected this because it said georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia wanted independence .
moscow circulated its own draft calling on the security council to endorse the six-point peace plan brokered by france and agreed by moscow and tbilisi .
" our draft resolution is a reconfirmation of the six-point agreement , and there 's no territorial integrity in the six principles , " said russia 's un ambassador , vitaly churkin .
some elderly georgians were evacuated from s ossetia on thursday now russia 's ambassador says his resolution is going into its final form , so it can be voted on .
but the us and its allies insist russia is not respecting the ceasefire plan because it is not withdrawing from georgia quickly enough .
the us deputy ambassador to the un , alejandro wolff , said under the circumstances he thought america would be prepared to oppose russia 's resolution .
russia 's land forces commander , gen vladimir boldyrev , has said all russian combat troops will move back from georgia proper to south ossetia by the weekend .
most of the soldiers sent to the region as reinforcements will return from south ossetia to russia within 10 days , he added .
however , moscow will retain 500 peacekeepers in a security zone stretching 7km -lrb- four miles -rrb- beyond the border of south ossetia into georgia proper - a move tbilisi says is unacceptable .

this picture of a world without wires is one long dreamed of and came a step closer following significant progress made by intel .
it said it has increased the efficiency of a technique for wirelessly powering consumer gadgets and computers .
" the notion of disappearing energy sources is a powerful one , " justin rattner , intel technology boss , told the bbc .
" would n't it be fantastic if we did n't think about where the power was coming from and the power was everywhere ? " he said .
" no cords , no batteries anymore . "
mr rattner envisaged a scenario where a laptop 's battery could be recharged when the machine gets within several feet of a transmit resonator which could be embedded in tables , work surfaces , picture frames and even behind walls .
intel 's technology relies on an idea called magnetic induction .
it is a principle similar to the way a trained singer can shatter a glass using their voice ; the glass absorbs acoustic energy at its natural frequency .
at the wall socket , power is put into magnetic fields at a transmitting resonator - basically an antenna .
the receiving resonator is tuned to efficiently absorb energy from the magnetic field , whereas nearby objects do not .
light bulb moment intel 's demonstration has built on work done originally by marin soljacic , a physicist at massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- .
at the intel developer forum in san francisco , researcher alanson sample showed how to make a 60-watt light bulb glow from an energy source three feet away .
wrel wastes scarcely more electricity than some computer power supplies this was achieved with relatively high efficiency , only losing a quarter of the energy it started with .
in early experiments the mit team lit their light bulb from seven feet away with larger charging coils and scoring an efficiency rate of between 40-45 % .
this meant most of the energy did not make it to the light bulb .
mit has since improved its system to 90 % efficiency at the three feet range .
' world changing ' intel has called the system wrel , a wireless resonant energy link while mit named it witricity - a combination of wireless and electricity .
professor soljacic , who does not work with intel , said he was nonetheless pleased that the world 's biggest computer chip maker is getting behind the technology .
he told the ap news wire " for me it 's like a confirmation that it 's so exciting .
it 's something people would like to have .
intel hopes its wrel technology will cut the last link to the power cord " now the question is if it 's feasible or not .
it 's exciting that they 're also inspired and it seems closer to reality every day . "
intel researcher mr sample told the bbc , " the next stage we are thinking about is to wirelessly recharge devices like laptops and cell phones so we are shrinking the size of the coils down to the size of laptops .
" the coils would be embedded in a monitor or a picture frame or desk .
it 's really compelling for the mobile device where you would be able to recharge your device as you enter one of these areas . "
" this is a potentially world changing event , " said analyst rob enderle of enderle group .
" this is the closest we 've had to something being commercially available in this class . "
mr rattner admitted the technology is at least five years away , if not more , of becoming a reality .

this picture of a world without wires is one long dreamed of and came a step closer following significant progress made by intel .
it said it has increased the efficiency of a technique for wirelessly powering consumer gadgets and computers .
" the notion of disappearing energy sources is a powerful one , " justin rattner , intel technology boss , told the bbc .
" would n't it be fantastic if we did n't think about where the power was coming from and the power was everywhere ? " he said .
" no cords , no batteries anymore . "
mr rattner envisaged a scenario where a laptop 's battery could be recharged when the machine gets within several feet of a transmit resonator which could be embedded in tables , work surfaces , picture frames and even behind walls .
intel 's technology relies on an idea called magnetic induction .
it is a principle similar to the way a trained singer can shatter a glass using their voice ; the glass absorbs acoustic energy at its natural frequency .
at the wall socket , power is put into magnetic fields at a transmitting resonator - basically an antenna .
the receiving resonator is tuned to efficiently absorb energy from the magnetic field , whereas nearby objects do not .
light bulb moment intel 's demonstration has built on work done originally by marin soljacic , a physicist at massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- .
at the intel developer forum in san francisco , researcher alanson sample showed how to make a 60-watt light bulb glow from an energy source three feet away .
wrel wastes scarcely more electricity than some computer power supplies this was achieved with relatively high efficiency , only losing a quarter of the energy it started with .
in early experiments the mit team lit their light bulb from seven feet away with larger charging coils and scoring an efficiency rate of between 40-45 % .
this meant most of the energy did not make it to the light bulb .
mit has since improved its system to 90 % efficiency at the three feet range .
' world changing ' intel has called the system wrel , a wireless resonant energy link while mit named it witricity - a combination of wireless and electricity .
professor soljacic , who does not work with intel , said he was nonetheless pleased that the world 's biggest computer chip maker is getting behind the technology .
he told the ap news wire " for me it 's like a confirmation that it 's so exciting .
it 's something people would like to have .
intel hopes its wrel technology will cut the last link to the power cord " now the question is if it 's feasible or not .
it 's exciting that they 're also inspired and it seems closer to reality every day . "
intel researcher mr sample told the bbc , " the next stage we are thinking about is to wirelessly recharge devices like laptops and cell phones so we are shrinking the size of the coils down to the size of laptops .
" the coils would be embedded in a monitor or a picture frame or desk .
it 's really compelling for the mobile device where you would be able to recharge your device as you enter one of these areas . "
" this is a potentially world changing event , " said analyst rob enderle of enderle group .
" this is the closest we 've had to something being commercially available in this class . "
mr rattner admitted the technology is at least five years away , if not more , of becoming a reality .

this picture of a world without wires is one long dreamed of and came a step closer following significant progress made by intel .
it said it has increased the efficiency of a technique for wirelessly powering consumer gadgets and computers .
" the notion of disappearing energy sources is a powerful one , " justin rattner , intel technology boss , told the bbc .
" would n't it be fantastic if we did n't think about where the power was coming from and the power was everywhere ? " he said .
" no cords , no batteries anymore . "
mr rattner envisaged a scenario where a laptop 's battery could be recharged when the machine gets within several feet of a transmit resonator which could be embedded in tables , work surfaces , picture frames and even behind walls .
intel 's technology relies on an idea called magnetic induction .
it is a principle similar to the way a trained singer can shatter a glass using their voice ; the glass absorbs acoustic energy at its natural frequency .
at the wall socket , power is put into magnetic fields at a transmitting resonator - basically an antenna .
the receiving resonator is tuned to efficiently absorb energy from the magnetic field , whereas nearby objects do not .
light bulb moment intel 's demonstration has built on work done originally by marin soljacic , a physicist at massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- .
at the intel developer forum in san francisco , researcher alanson sample showed how to make a 60-watt light bulb glow from an energy source three feet away .
wrel wastes scarcely more electricity than some computer power supplies this was achieved with relatively high efficiency , only losing a quarter of the energy it started with .
in early experiments the mit team lit their light bulb from seven feet away with larger charging coils and scoring an efficiency rate of between 40-45 % .
this meant most of the energy did not make it to the light bulb .
mit has since improved its system to 90 % efficiency at the three feet range .
' world changing ' intel has called the system wrel , a wireless resonant energy link while mit named it witricity - a combination of wireless and electricity .
professor soljacic , who does not work with intel , said he was nonetheless pleased that the world 's biggest computer chip maker is getting behind the technology .
he told the ap news wire " for me it 's like a confirmation that it 's so exciting .
it 's something people would like to have .
intel hopes its wrel technology will cut the last link to the power cord " now the question is if it 's feasible or not .
it 's exciting that they 're also inspired and it seems closer to reality every day . "
intel researcher mr sample told the bbc , " the next stage we are thinking about is to wirelessly recharge devices like laptops and cell phones so we are shrinking the size of the coils down to the size of laptops .
" the coils would be embedded in a monitor or a picture frame or desk .
it 's really compelling for the mobile device where you would be able to recharge your device as you enter one of these areas . "
" this is a potentially world changing event , " said analyst rob enderle of enderle group .
" this is the closest we 've had to something being commercially available in this class . "
mr rattner admitted the technology is at least five years away , if not more , of becoming a reality .

bollywood 's biggest names take to the stage bollywood comes to britain this weekend as some of the biggest stars of indian cinema perform at london 's o2 arena .
though they may be largely unknown to western film-goers , the stars of india 's homegrown movie industry command enormous respect and adulation on their native soil .
one , though , stands head and shoulders above the rest - the legendary amitabh bachchan , otherwise known as the big b. the star of sholay , one of the most famous hindi movies ever made , and former host of india 's version of who wants to be a millionaire ? , the 65-year-old has appeared in more than 150 films .
this weekend , though , he can be found in london on the penultimate stop for a touring extravaganza dedicated to indian cinema .
' wonderful ' with bachchan joined by his son abhishek and his daughter-in-law aishwarya rai , both of whom are massive stars in their own right , the unforgettable tour offers a rare chance to see bollywood 's first family together .
the bachchan clan comprise three of bollywood 's biggest stars " in mumbai we do n't often get the chance to spend time with each other , because of our shooting schedules , " admits bachchan senior .
" so it has been a wonderful experience to travel together , to perform together and to sit and laugh together when the show is over . "
" this tour is extremely special because it is my first tour with my husband , the love of my life , " agreed aishwarya rai bachchan , who married abhishek bachchan in april 2007 .
" it 's very special to have my father-in-law here too .
i 'm so glad pa agreed to be a part of this - he is a legend . "
" there never will be a tour like this , " said preity zinta , star of such hits as salaam namaste and a former bbc news website columnist .
" most of the tours i 've done have been with my contemporaries .
it 's a different experience to stand on stage with mr bachchan . "
" he is the star , " agrees his son .
" whenever he 's on stage , everybody leaves what they 're doing to watch him perform . "
awareness since the unforgettable tour began in july , bachchan and company have re-enacted songs and scenes from their movies in canada , the us and trinidad and tobago .
big brother star shilpa shetty will also appear at the london concert that they have been greeted by dedicated fans in all three countries is a testament to what bachchan calls " the resilience of indian cinema " .
" in 1973 i came to do a show in southall , west london and there were five people in the theatre , " he recalls in his distinctive baritone .
" since then we 've matured and grown and huge numbers are coming out to see us . "
given the sizeable carbon footprint the tour is leaving as it travels around the globe , it is perhaps surprising to learn its stated aim is to raise awareness about climate change .
bachchan , however , said the issue was chosen because " it is a cause that encompasses everyone " .
" all of us are victims of global warming , " he told reporters in central london in thursday .
" we felt it was something that was universal . "
one hopes that the thousands planning to attend his concert on sunday will use public transport to get there .

bollywood 's biggest names take to the stage bollywood comes to britain this weekend as some of the biggest stars of indian cinema perform at london 's o2 arena .
though they may be largely unknown to western film-goers , the stars of india 's homegrown movie industry command enormous respect and adulation on their native soil .
one , though , stands head and shoulders above the rest - the legendary amitabh bachchan , otherwise known as the big b. the star of sholay , one of the most famous hindi movies ever made , and former host of india 's version of who wants to be a millionaire ? , the 65-year-old has appeared in more than 150 films .
this weekend , though , he can be found in london on the penultimate stop for a touring extravaganza dedicated to indian cinema .
' wonderful ' with bachchan joined by his son abhishek and his daughter-in-law aishwarya rai , both of whom are massive stars in their own right , the unforgettable tour offers a rare chance to see bollywood 's first family together .
the bachchan clan comprise three of bollywood 's biggest stars " in mumbai we do n't often get the chance to spend time with each other , because of our shooting schedules , " admits bachchan senior .
" so it has been a wonderful experience to travel together , to perform together and to sit and laugh together when the show is over . "
" this tour is extremely special because it is my first tour with my husband , the love of my life , " agreed aishwarya rai bachchan , who married abhishek bachchan in april 2007 .
" it 's very special to have my father-in-law here too .
i 'm so glad pa agreed to be a part of this - he is a legend . "
" there never will be a tour like this , " said preity zinta , star of such hits as salaam namaste and a former bbc news website columnist .
" most of the tours i 've done have been with my contemporaries .
it 's a different experience to stand on stage with mr bachchan . "
" he is the star , " agrees his son .
" whenever he 's on stage , everybody leaves what they 're doing to watch him perform . "
awareness since the unforgettable tour began in july , bachchan and company have re-enacted songs and scenes from their movies in canada , the us and trinidad and tobago .
big brother star shilpa shetty will also appear at the london concert that they have been greeted by dedicated fans in all three countries is a testament to what bachchan calls " the resilience of indian cinema " .
" in 1973 i came to do a show in southall , west london and there were five people in the theatre , " he recalls in his distinctive baritone .
" since then we 've matured and grown and huge numbers are coming out to see us . "
given the sizeable carbon footprint the tour is leaving as it travels around the globe , it is perhaps surprising to learn its stated aim is to raise awareness about climate change .
bachchan , however , said the issue was chosen because " it is a cause that encompasses everyone " .
" all of us are victims of global warming , " he told reporters in central london in thursday .
" we felt it was something that was universal . "
one hopes that the thousands planning to attend his concert on sunday will use public transport to get there .
