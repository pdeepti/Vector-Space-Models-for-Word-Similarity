5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page . with opinion polls showing barack obama expanding his lead over john mccain just days before the united states presidential election , attention is turning to what kind of policies obama will try to execute if and when he occupies the white house after inauguration day on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william drozdiak already , this presidential transition is shaping up as one of the most difficult in american history : the next president will inherit two wars in iraq and afghanistan , potential showdowns over nuclear threats from iran and north korea , a newly aggressive russia , and a financial crisis worse than anything since the great depression .
even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .
more support from europe the global economic crisis has in some respects overwhelmed what was already a daunting foreign policy agenda .
james steinberg , the former deputy national security advisor in the clinton administration , is heading the transition team assigned to shaping the foreign and security policies and assembling the team that will carry them out .
obama has declared his intention to set a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq within 16 months of taking office and will try to move even more quickly in order to reassign forces to the conflict in afghanistan , where the taliban and their al-qaeda allies have been ascendant . in addition , obama will call on the european allies to assume greater responsibility in helping shape policies to combat terrorism that will put new emphasis on economic reconstruction rather than brute military force - in other words , a more determined effort to win hearts and minds rather than kill suspected enemies .
he has also expressed a desire to show american leadership by embarking on new initiatives in three areas neglected by the bush administration : climate change , nuclear disarmament , and a ban on torture to show respect for international law like the geneva convention .
while those policy changes will no doubt be applauded in european capitals , the call for europe to do more during a phase of economic turmoil in helping the united states may not be greeted with enthusiasm .
the end of the unilateral bush era the obama administration will have no choice but to tackle several major challenges at once .
he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .
the heads of the other 26 allied governments will listen closely to obama 's speech for insights into his presidency , but his words are likely to be long on symbolism and short on substance since he will no doubt still be putting together his cabinet and foreign policy team . but he will surely show that america has turned the page on the bush presidency by declaring the era of unilateralism is over and that the united states will re-engage with the rest of the world , including direct talks with its enemies , by demonstrating an abiding commitment to diplomacy and the rule of international law .
dramatic difference opinion surveys show that this change is strongly supported by the american people , who have grown dismayed and disenchanted with the misbegotten military adventures of the neoconservative cabal that dominated bush 's foreign policy team .
in short , america and the world will probably wake up on the morning of nov .
5 to a dramatically different government taking over in the united states .
if obama can fulfill the hopes and ambitions of the millions of american voters yearning for change , he will go down in history books as a transformational leader who brought the united states back from the precipice of decline as a world power and restored its original sense of purpose as a stalwart defender of democratic values and human rights . william m. drozdiak has been the president of the american council on germany -lrb- acg -rrb- since february 2005 .
prior to that , he was the executive director of the transatlantic center of the german marshall fund of the united states .
in addition , he has worked as an editor and foreign correspondent for the washington post , time and the washington star , covering such historical events as the collapse of the soviet union , the first peace agreement between israel and egypt and the iran-iraq war .
drozdiak was a professional basketball player in the us and europe between 1971 and 1978 . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , the roman catholic archbishop who is the most outspoken of germany 's 27 diocesan leaders in his criticism of big business , says that his work is to some extent " an argument with marxism .

" social teaching in a globalized world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx is unrelated to the communist ideologue the modern-day marx demands that the whole world adopt a market economy that is kinder to the weak and downtrodden instead of " heaping even more rewards on those who behave immorally . " " that 's not utopia .
it 's a necessity for the sake of humans , " said marx in munich . the 300-page book , " das kapital : a plea for man " , deliberately borrows its title from the " bible " of communism in which karl marx claimed 140 years ago that capitalism would automatically collapse . with this new book , however , marx intends to highlight the value of catholic social teaching in a globalized world . " capitalism without humanity , solidarity and justice has no morals and no future , " marx writes . he said we need to take a fresh look at social justice , or the world might veer back to dangerous ideologies such as marxism . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , to retain the bundesliga lead in the midweek round . demba ba , vedad ibisevic -lrb- penalty -rrb- and carlos eduardo scored within six minutes to reverse bochum 's early lead from dennis grote .
bochum 's agony was complete when christoph dabrowski was sent off . newly-promoted hoffenheim top the bill with 22 points from bayer leverkusen -lrb- 21 -rrb- , with sv hamburg third on 20 from a 2-0 victory against vfb stuttgart .
champions bayern munich rose to fourth place with 18 points from their third straight win , a 2-1 comeback effort at eintracht frankfurt from miroslav klose and franck ribery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim scored all three goals within six minutes hoffenheim remained the toast of the league even though they were shocked just two minutes into the game in bochum when grote fired a low shot into the net from the edge of the area .
it took hoffenheim until the 65th minute to level , from a neat back-heeler by ba , and the visitors then went on the roll yet again to claim their fourth straight victory .
league top scorer ibisevic raised his tally to 11 with a 70th-minute penalty after grote had brought down andreas beck .
eduardo wrapped up matters just 60 seconds later and bochum 's frustration showed when dabrowski had to leave for a second bookable offence in the 76th .

but we have played quite well so far in the season and aim to keep going , " said beck .

we showed that we are a team which can attack , " said munich midfielder tim borowski .
former leaders hamburg , meanwhile , recovered well from sunday 's 3-0 loss in hoffenheim .

instead , the roman catholic archbishop who is the most outspoken of germany 's 27 diocesan leaders in his criticism of big business , says that his work is to some extent " an argument with marxism . " the book begins as a letter addressed to his " dear namesake . " " the consequences , " he tells the 19th-century ideologist , " of your thinking were disastrous . " social teaching in a globalized world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx is unrelated to the communist ideologue the modern-day marx demands that the whole world adopt a market economy that is kinder to the weak and downtrodden instead of " heaping even more rewards on those who behave immorally . " " that 's not utopia .
it 's a necessity for the sake of humans , " said marx in munich . the 300-page book , " das kapital : a plea for man " , deliberately borrows its title from the " bible " of communism in which karl marx claimed 140 years ago that capitalism would automatically collapse . with this new book , however , marx intends to highlight the value of catholic social teaching in a globalized world . " capitalism without humanity , solidarity and justice has no morals and no future , " marx writes . he said we need to take a fresh look at social justice , or the world might veer back to dangerous ideologies such as marxism . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government is planning to introduce a two-year , tax-free scheme for new environmentally-friendly cars .
but environmentalists have warned the plan will backfire because the criteria are not strict enough . " we want to introduce an automobile tax exemption for cars that are particularly clean , " environment minister sigmar gabriel told ard public television on thursday , oct .
30 .
" that is the proposal that the finance minister will present .
but we still need the approval of the federal states . " automobile taxes are raised by germany 's 16 states and gabriel said finance minister peer steinbrueck would negotiate with the states about how to make up for the resulting tax shortfall . " we of course do not want the states to shoulder the burden on their own , " gabriel said . the tax breaks are likely to last one or two years depending on the car 's particular specifications . criteria not strict enough , say environmentalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentally , japan is still putting the german car industry to shame environmentalists attacked the proposal saying the criteria for the tax exemption were so lax they would include most new cars including gas guzzlers such as sport utility vehicles , which since 2005 have had to meet new emissions standards . " petrol-thirsty automobiles with big motors will benefit , " the ngo german environmental aid said in a statement , calling chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition as " car-driven . " " this is a giant purchase incentive for climate killers , " it said . the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , juergen trittin , has attacked the move , saying the government was acting blindly .
he said cabinet members were organizing a sell-off of pollution-spewing gas guzzlers . " if people are to be encouraged to buy , then they have to promote the purchase of low-consumption cars - of vehicles that produce less than 120 gram of co2 per kilometer , " the former environment minister urged . the german newspaper rheinische post said the tax break would probably cost 2 billion euros in 2009 , citing government sources . older cars would not be eligible for the exemption , which gabriel said the cabinet planned to approve next wednesday and roll out on jan .
1 . gabriel said berlin aimed to eventually introduce a sliding scale for car tax pegged to the amount of carbon emissions that they produce rather than the size of their engines .
co2 emissions are blamed for driving global warming . german carmakers welcome the plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups say the proposal is nothing but a support for carmakers the car industry in both europe and the united states has been appealing to governments to act to revive sales in the financial-crisis struck sector .
the vda , the german automobile industry 's biggest interest group , welcomed the plan . " the tax holiday proposed today for new cars can provide an impetus to spur sales of vehicles , stabilize the economy and thus ensure jobs in germany , " vda president matthias wissmann said in a statement .
he also added that the industry would welcome a tax based on the level of co2 emissions . with credit scarce and sales plunging , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen threw his weight on wednesday behind a call to give the bloc 's carmakers cheap loans worth up to 40 billion euros to invest in the development of eco-friendly cars during the financial crisis . the car industry is a key pillar of europe 's biggest economy , home to giants including volkswagen , bmw and porsche .
up to now , the sector has been rather resistant to moving away from its traditional niche market of large , luxury cars with big engines . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government is planning to introduce a two-year , tax-free scheme for new environmentally-friendly cars .
but environmentalists have warned the plan will backfire because the criteria are not strict enough . " we want to introduce an automobile tax exemption for cars that are particularly clean , " environment minister sigmar gabriel told ard public television on thursday , oct .
30 .
" that is the proposal that the finance minister will present .
but we still need the approval of the federal states . " automobile taxes are raised by germany 's 16 states and gabriel said finance minister peer steinbrueck would negotiate with the states about how to make up for the resulting tax shortfall . " we of course do not want the states to shoulder the burden on their own , " gabriel said . the tax breaks are likely to last one or two years depending on the car 's particular specifications . criteria not strict enough , say environmentalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentally , japan is still putting the german car industry to shame environmentalists attacked the proposal saying the criteria for the tax exemption were so lax they would include most new cars including gas guzzlers such as sport utility vehicles , which since 2005 have had to meet new emissions standards . " petrol-thirsty automobiles with big motors will benefit , " the ngo german environmental aid said in a statement , calling chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition as " car-driven . " " this is a giant purchase incentive for climate killers , " it said . the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , juergen trittin , has attacked the move , saying the government was acting blindly .
he said cabinet members were organizing a sell-off of pollution-spewing gas guzzlers . " if people are to be encouraged to buy , then they have to promote the purchase of low-consumption cars - of vehicles that produce less than 120 gram of co2 per kilometer , " the former environment minister urged . the german newspaper rheinische post said the tax break would probably cost 2 billion euros in 2009 , citing government sources . older cars would not be eligible for the exemption , which gabriel said the cabinet planned to approve next wednesday and roll out on jan .
1 . gabriel said berlin aimed to eventually introduce a sliding scale for car tax pegged to the amount of carbon emissions that they produce rather than the size of their engines .
co2 emissions are blamed for driving global warming . german carmakers welcome the plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups say the proposal is nothing but a support for carmakers the car industry in both europe and the united states has been appealing to governments to act to revive sales in the financial-crisis struck sector .
the vda , the german automobile industry 's biggest interest group , welcomed the plan . " the tax holiday proposed today for new cars can provide an impetus to spur sales of vehicles , stabilize the economy and thus ensure jobs in germany , " vda president matthias wissmann said in a statement .
he also added that the industry would welcome a tax based on the level of co2 emissions . with credit scarce and sales plunging , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen threw his weight on wednesday behind a call to give the bloc 's carmakers cheap loans worth up to 40 billion euros to invest in the development of eco-friendly cars during the financial crisis . the car industry is a key pillar of europe 's biggest economy , home to giants including volkswagen , bmw and porsche .
up to now , the sector has been rather resistant to moving away from its traditional niche market of large , luxury cars with big engines . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" change of mentality " it 's a serious issue , " parliamentary spokesman jaume duch fridau told the afp news service earlier in the week .
fridau added that the letter had been passed on to parliament president hans-gert poettering . if the eu agrees to the demands of the letter , it would be aligning itself with a 2006 decision by the nordic council , which is made up of denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden .
the european deputies said such a decision could help tackle the problems of prostitution , organized crime , and human trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : streetwalkers are often victims of human trafficking " it requires a change of mentality " to end the situation where you have " hotels as providers of sex trade with humans , as if they were dealing with an ordinary commodity , " the letter claimed . organized crime was involved in " the increase in human trafficking where , for example , young women from poor countries are sold to a life as sex slaves in the prostitution industry , " the letter continued . union of values one of the letter 's signatories , swedish mep helene goudin , said it was also necessary to ban elected meps and their staff from using hotels that air pornographic films in their bedrooms . " we are against the exploitation of women in general , " she told afp .
" the european union is a union of values and we thing we should reach agreement on this subject . " the letter was not raising the question of whether or not prostitution should be made legal , according to its instigator , danish parliamentarian karin riis joergensen . " it is simply about the fact that during the strasburg parliamentary weeks , we do n't want to go into hotels where there are prostitutes , " she told tagesschau.de .
lawmakers who want to set up parties with prostitutes should go elsewhere , she said .
" but not in the same hotels with us .
we just want clean hotels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovely strasbourg , surrounded by a shady ring road the reaction to the demands has been low-key so far .
bavarian eu lawmaker manfred ferber told tagesschau he was " surprised , at first , that there was such a letter . " lawmakers worry about reputation " i 've been in the same hotel for more than 11 years and have n't noticed anything up to now , " he said . ferber is one of many parliamentarians who worry that the uproar wo n't do so much to fight prostitution as it will to blemish the reputation of eu lawmakers in the eyes of their constituents . but the fact remains that the small french city is a center for the illegal sex trade , according to tagesschau .
the site reports that a ring road that surrounds the old town is one long red-light district , populated mostly by eastern european prostitutes - many of whom are there unwillingly . meanwhile , europeans are anything but unified on how to deal with prostitution .
does it make more sense to outlaw it , like denmark does ?
to limit it , like they do in france ?

" change of mentality " it 's a serious issue , " parliamentary spokesman jaume duch fridau told the afp news service earlier in the week .
fridau added that the letter had been passed on to parliament president hans-gert poettering . if the eu agrees to the demands of the letter , it would be aligning itself with a 2006 decision by the nordic council , which is made up of denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden .
the european deputies said such a decision could help tackle the problems of prostitution , organized crime , and human trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : streetwalkers are often victims of human trafficking " it requires a change of mentality " to end the situation where you have " hotels as providers of sex trade with humans , as if they were dealing with an ordinary commodity , " the letter claimed . organized crime was involved in " the increase in human trafficking where , for example , young women from poor countries are sold to a life as sex slaves in the prostitution industry , " the letter continued . union of values one of the letter 's signatories , swedish mep helene goudin , said it was also necessary to ban elected meps and their staff from using hotels that air pornographic films in their bedrooms . " we are against the exploitation of women in general , " she told afp .
" the european union is a union of values and we thing we should reach agreement on this subject . " the letter was not raising the question of whether or not prostitution should be made legal , according to its instigator , danish parliamentarian karin riis joergensen . " it is simply about the fact that during the strasburg parliamentary weeks , we do n't want to go into hotels where there are prostitutes , " she told tagesschau.de .
lawmakers who want to set up parties with prostitutes should go elsewhere , she said .
" but not in the same hotels with us .
we just want clean hotels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovely strasbourg , surrounded by a shady ring road the reaction to the demands has been low-key so far .
bavarian eu lawmaker manfred ferber told tagesschau he was " surprised , at first , that there was such a letter . " lawmakers worry about reputation " i 've been in the same hotel for more than 11 years and have n't noticed anything up to now , " he said . ferber is one of many parliamentarians who worry that the uproar wo n't do so much to fight prostitution as it will to blemish the reputation of eu lawmakers in the eyes of their constituents . but the fact remains that the small french city is a center for the illegal sex trade , according to tagesschau .
the site reports that a ring road that surrounds the old town is one long red-light district , populated mostly by eastern european prostitutes - many of whom are there unwillingly . meanwhile , europeans are anything but unified on how to deal with prostitution .
does it make more sense to outlaw it , like denmark does ?
to limit it , like they do in france ?
or do the germans , who have legalized the trade , have the right idea ?

" " that 's not utopia .
it 's a necessity for the sake of humans , " said marx in munich . the 300-page book , " das kapital : a plea for man " , deliberately borrows its title from the " bible " of communism in which karl marx claimed 140 years ago that capitalism would automatically collapse . with this new book , however , marx intends to highlight the value of catholic social teaching in a globalized world .

" change of mentality " it 's a serious issue , " parliamentary spokesman jaume duch fridau told the afp news service earlier in the week .
fridau added that the letter had been passed on to parliament president hans-gert poettering . if the eu agrees to the demands of the letter , it would be aligning itself with a 2006 decision by the nordic council , which is made up of denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden .
the european deputies said such a decision could help tackle the problems of prostitution , organized crime , and human trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : streetwalkers are often victims of human trafficking " it requires a change of mentality " to end the situation where you have " hotels as providers of sex trade with humans , as if they were dealing with an ordinary commodity , " the letter claimed . organized crime was involved in " the increase in human trafficking where , for example , young women from poor countries are sold to a life as sex slaves in the prostitution industry , " the letter continued . union of values one of the letter 's signatories , swedish mep helene goudin , said it was also necessary to ban elected meps and their staff from using hotels that air pornographic films in their bedrooms . " we are against the exploitation of women in general , " she told afp .
" the european union is a union of values and we thing we should reach agreement on this subject . " the letter was not raising the question of whether or not prostitution should be made legal , according to its instigator , danish parliamentarian karin riis joergensen . " it is simply about the fact that during the strasburg parliamentary weeks , we do n't want to go into hotels where there are prostitutes , " she told tagesschau.de .
lawmakers who want to set up parties with prostitutes should go elsewhere , she said .
" but not in the same hotels with us .
we just want clean hotels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovely strasbourg , surrounded by a shady ring road the reaction to the demands has been low-key so far .
bavarian eu lawmaker manfred ferber told tagesschau he was " surprised , at first , that there was such a letter . " lawmakers worry about reputation " i 've been in the same hotel for more than 11 years and have n't noticed anything up to now , " he said . ferber is one of many parliamentarians who worry that the uproar wo n't do so much to fight prostitution as it will to blemish the reputation of eu lawmakers in the eyes of their constituents . but the fact remains that the small french city is a center for the illegal sex trade , according to tagesschau .
the site reports that a ring road that surrounds the old town is one long red-light district , populated mostly by eastern european prostitutes - many of whom are there unwillingly . meanwhile , europeans are anything but unified on how to deal with prostitution .
does it make more sense to outlaw it , like denmark does ?
to limit it , like they do in france ?

the german government is planning to introduce a two-year , tax-free scheme for new environmentally-friendly cars .
but environmentalists have warned the plan will backfire because the criteria are not strict enough . " we want to introduce an automobile tax exemption for cars that are particularly clean , " environment minister sigmar gabriel told ard public television on thursday , oct .
30 .
" that is the proposal that the finance minister will present .
but we still need the approval of the federal states . " automobile taxes are raised by germany 's 16 states and gabriel said finance minister peer steinbrueck would negotiate with the states about how to make up for the resulting tax shortfall . " we of course do not want the states to shoulder the burden on their own , " gabriel said . the tax breaks are likely to last one or two years depending on the car 's particular specifications . criteria not strict enough , say environmentalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentally , japan is still putting the german car industry to shame environmentalists attacked the proposal saying the criteria for the tax exemption were so lax they would include most new cars including gas guzzlers such as sport utility vehicles , which since 2005 have had to meet new emissions standards . " petrol-thirsty automobiles with big motors will benefit , " the ngo german environmental aid said in a statement , calling chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition as " car-driven . " " this is a giant purchase incentive for climate killers , " it said . the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , juergen trittin , has attacked the move , saying the government was acting blindly .
he said cabinet members were organizing a sell-off of pollution-spewing gas guzzlers . " if people are to be encouraged to buy , then they have to promote the purchase of low-consumption cars - of vehicles that produce less than 120 gram of co2 per kilometer , " the former environment minister urged . the german newspaper rheinische post said the tax break would probably cost 2 billion euros in 2009 , citing government sources . older cars would not be eligible for the exemption , which gabriel said the cabinet planned to approve next wednesday and roll out on jan .
1 . gabriel said berlin aimed to eventually introduce a sliding scale for car tax pegged to the amount of carbon emissions that they produce rather than the size of their engines .
co2 emissions are blamed for driving global warming . german carmakers welcome the plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups say the proposal is nothing but a support for carmakers the car industry in both europe and the united states has been appealing to governments to act to revive sales in the financial-crisis struck sector .

5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page . with opinion polls showing barack obama expanding his lead over john mccain just days before the united states presidential election , attention is turning to what kind of policies obama will try to execute if and when he occupies the white house after inauguration day on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william drozdiak already , this presidential transition is shaping up as one of the most difficult in american history : the next president will inherit two wars in iraq and afghanistan , potential showdowns over nuclear threats from iran and north korea , a newly aggressive russia , and a financial crisis worse than anything since the great depression .
even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .
more support from europe the global economic crisis has in some respects overwhelmed what was already a daunting foreign policy agenda .
james steinberg , the former deputy national security advisor in the clinton administration , is heading the transition team assigned to shaping the foreign and security policies and assembling the team that will carry them out .
obama has declared his intention to set a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq within 16 months of taking office and will try to move even more quickly in order to reassign forces to the conflict in afghanistan , where the taliban and their al-qaeda allies have been ascendant . in addition , obama will call on the european allies to assume greater responsibility in helping shape policies to combat terrorism that will put new emphasis on economic reconstruction rather than brute military force - in other words , a more determined effort to win hearts and minds rather than kill suspected enemies .
he has also expressed a desire to show american leadership by embarking on new initiatives in three areas neglected by the bush administration : climate change , nuclear disarmament , and a ban on torture to show respect for international law like the geneva convention .
while those policy changes will no doubt be applauded in european capitals , the call for europe to do more during a phase of economic turmoil in helping the united states may not be greeted with enthusiasm .
the end of the unilateral bush era the obama administration will have no choice but to tackle several major challenges at once .
he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .
the heads of the other 26 allied governments will listen closely to obama 's speech for insights into his presidency , but his words are likely to be long on symbolism and short on substance since he will no doubt still be putting together his cabinet and foreign policy team . but he will surely show that america has turned the page on the bush presidency by declaring the era of unilateralism is over and that the united states will re-engage with the rest of the world , including direct talks with its enemies , by demonstrating an abiding commitment to diplomacy and the rule of international law .
dramatic difference opinion surveys show that this change is strongly supported by the american people , who have grown dismayed and disenchanted with the misbegotten military adventures of the neoconservative cabal that dominated bush 's foreign policy team .
in short , america and the world will probably wake up on the morning of nov .
5 to a dramatically different government taking over in the united states .
if obama can fulfill the hopes and ambitions of the millions of american voters yearning for change , he will go down in history books as a transformational leader who brought the united states back from the precipice of decline as a world power and restored its original sense of purpose as a stalwart defender of democratic values and human rights . william m. drozdiak has been the president of the american council on germany -lrb- acg -rrb- since february 2005 .
prior to that , he was the executive director of the transatlantic center of the german marshall fund of the united states .
in addition , he has worked as an editor and foreign correspondent for the washington post , time and the washington star , covering such historical events as the collapse of the soviet union , the first peace agreement between israel and egypt and the iran-iraq war .
drozdiak was a professional basketball player in the us and europe between 1971 and 1978 . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a necessity for the sake of humans , " said marx in munich . the 300-page book , " das kapital : a plea for man " , deliberately borrows its title from the " bible " of communism in which karl marx claimed 140 years ago that capitalism would automatically collapse . with this new book , however , marx intends to highlight the value of catholic social teaching in a globalized world .

the german government is planning to introduce a two-year , tax-free scheme for new environmentally-friendly cars .
but environmentalists have warned the plan will backfire because the criteria are not strict enough . " we want to introduce an automobile tax exemption for cars that are particularly clean , " environment minister sigmar gabriel told ard public television on thursday , oct .
30 .
" that is the proposal that the finance minister will present .
but we still need the approval of the federal states . " automobile taxes are raised by germany 's 16 states and gabriel said finance minister peer steinbrueck would negotiate with the states about how to make up for the resulting tax shortfall . " we of course do not want the states to shoulder the burden on their own , " gabriel said . the tax breaks are likely to last one or two years depending on the car 's particular specifications . criteria not strict enough , say environmentalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentally , japan is still putting the german car industry to shame environmentalists attacked the proposal saying the criteria for the tax exemption were so lax they would include most new cars including gas guzzlers such as sport utility vehicles , which since 2005 have had to meet new emissions standards . " petrol-thirsty automobiles with big motors will benefit , " the ngo german environmental aid said in a statement , calling chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition as " car-driven . " " this is a giant purchase incentive for climate killers , " it said . the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , juergen trittin , has attacked the move , saying the government was acting blindly .
he said cabinet members were organizing a sell-off of pollution-spewing gas guzzlers . " if people are to be encouraged to buy , then they have to promote the purchase of low-consumption cars - of vehicles that produce less than 120 gram of co2 per kilometer , " the former environment minister urged . the german newspaper rheinische post said the tax break would probably cost 2 billion euros in 2009 , citing government sources . older cars would not be eligible for the exemption , which gabriel said the cabinet planned to approve next wednesday and roll out on jan .
1 . gabriel said berlin aimed to eventually introduce a sliding scale for car tax pegged to the amount of carbon emissions that they produce rather than the size of their engines .
co2 emissions are blamed for driving global warming . german carmakers welcome the plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups say the proposal is nothing but a support for carmakers the car industry in both europe and the united states has been appealing to governments to act to revive sales in the financial-crisis struck sector .
the vda , the german automobile industry 's biggest interest group , welcomed the plan . " the tax holiday proposed today for new cars can provide an impetus to spur sales of vehicles , stabilize the economy and thus ensure jobs in germany , " vda president matthias wissmann said in a statement .
he also added that the industry would welcome a tax based on the level of co2 emissions . with credit scarce and sales plunging , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen threw his weight on wednesday behind a call to give the bloc 's carmakers cheap loans worth up to 40 billion euros to invest in the development of eco-friendly cars during the financial crisis . the car industry is a key pillar of europe 's biggest economy , home to giants including volkswagen , bmw and porsche .
up to now , the sector has been rather resistant to moving away from its traditional niche market of large , luxury cars with big engines . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page . with opinion polls showing barack obama expanding his lead over john mccain just days before the united states presidential election , attention is turning to what kind of policies obama will try to execute if and when he occupies the white house after inauguration day on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william drozdiak already , this presidential transition is shaping up as one of the most difficult in american history : the next president will inherit two wars in iraq and afghanistan , potential showdowns over nuclear threats from iran and north korea , a newly aggressive russia , and a financial crisis worse than anything since the great depression .
even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .
more support from europe the global economic crisis has in some respects overwhelmed what was already a daunting foreign policy agenda .
james steinberg , the former deputy national security advisor in the clinton administration , is heading the transition team assigned to shaping the foreign and security policies and assembling the team that will carry them out .
obama has declared his intention to set a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq within 16 months of taking office and will try to move even more quickly in order to reassign forces to the conflict in afghanistan , where the taliban and their al-qaeda allies have been ascendant . in addition , obama will call on the european allies to assume greater responsibility in helping shape policies to combat terrorism that will put new emphasis on economic reconstruction rather than brute military force - in other words , a more determined effort to win hearts and minds rather than kill suspected enemies .
he has also expressed a desire to show american leadership by embarking on new initiatives in three areas neglected by the bush administration : climate change , nuclear disarmament , and a ban on torture to show respect for international law like the geneva convention .
while those policy changes will no doubt be applauded in european capitals , the call for europe to do more during a phase of economic turmoil in helping the united states may not be greeted with enthusiasm .
the end of the unilateral bush era the obama administration will have no choice but to tackle several major challenges at once .
he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .
the heads of the other 26 allied governments will listen closely to obama 's speech for insights into his presidency , but his words are likely to be long on symbolism and short on substance since he will no doubt still be putting together his cabinet and foreign policy team . but he will surely show that america has turned the page on the bush presidency by declaring the era of unilateralism is over and that the united states will re-engage with the rest of the world , including direct talks with its enemies , by demonstrating an abiding commitment to diplomacy and the rule of international law .
dramatic difference opinion surveys show that this change is strongly supported by the american people , who have grown dismayed and disenchanted with the misbegotten military adventures of the neoconservative cabal that dominated bush 's foreign policy team .
in short , america and the world will probably wake up on the morning of nov .
5 to a dramatically different government taking over in the united states .
if obama can fulfill the hopes and ambitions of the millions of american voters yearning for change , he will go down in history books as a transformational leader who brought the united states back from the precipice of decline as a world power and restored its original sense of purpose as a stalwart defender of democratic values and human rights . william m. drozdiak has been the president of the american council on germany -lrb- acg -rrb- since february 2005 .
prior to that , he was the executive director of the transatlantic center of the german marshall fund of the united states .
in addition , he has worked as an editor and foreign correspondent for the washington post , time and the washington star , covering such historical events as the collapse of the soviet union , the first peace agreement between israel and egypt and the iran-iraq war .

the german government is planning to introduce a two-year , tax-free scheme for new environmentally-friendly cars .
but environmentalists have warned the plan will backfire because the criteria are not strict enough . " we want to introduce an automobile tax exemption for cars that are particularly clean , " environment minister sigmar gabriel told ard public television on thursday , oct .
30 .
" that is the proposal that the finance minister will present .
but we still need the approval of the federal states . " automobile taxes are raised by germany 's 16 states and gabriel said finance minister peer steinbrueck would negotiate with the states about how to make up for the resulting tax shortfall . " we of course do not want the states to shoulder the burden on their own , " gabriel said . the tax breaks are likely to last one or two years depending on the car 's particular specifications . criteria not strict enough , say environmentalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentally , japan is still putting the german car industry to shame environmentalists attacked the proposal saying the criteria for the tax exemption were so lax they would include most new cars including gas guzzlers such as sport utility vehicles , which since 2005 have had to meet new emissions standards . " petrol-thirsty automobiles with big motors will benefit , " the ngo german environmental aid said in a statement , calling chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition as " car-driven . " " this is a giant purchase incentive for climate killers , " it said . the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , juergen trittin , has attacked the move , saying the government was acting blindly .
he said cabinet members were organizing a sell-off of pollution-spewing gas guzzlers . " if people are to be encouraged to buy , then they have to promote the purchase of low-consumption cars - of vehicles that produce less than 120 gram of co2 per kilometer , " the former environment minister urged . the german newspaper rheinische post said the tax break would probably cost 2 billion euros in 2009 , citing government sources . older cars would not be eligible for the exemption , which gabriel said the cabinet planned to approve next wednesday and roll out on jan .

5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page . with opinion polls showing barack obama expanding his lead over john mccain just days before the united states presidential election , attention is turning to what kind of policies obama will try to execute if and when he occupies the white house after inauguration day on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william drozdiak already , this presidential transition is shaping up as one of the most difficult in american history : the next president will inherit two wars in iraq and afghanistan , potential showdowns over nuclear threats from iran and north korea , a newly aggressive russia , and a financial crisis worse than anything since the great depression .
even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .
more support from europe the global economic crisis has in some respects overwhelmed what was already a daunting foreign policy agenda .
james steinberg , the former deputy national security advisor in the clinton administration , is heading the transition team assigned to shaping the foreign and security policies and assembling the team that will carry them out .
obama has declared his intention to set a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq within 16 months of taking office and will try to move even more quickly in order to reassign forces to the conflict in afghanistan , where the taliban and their al-qaeda allies have been ascendant . in addition , obama will call on the european allies to assume greater responsibility in helping shape policies to combat terrorism that will put new emphasis on economic reconstruction rather than brute military force - in other words , a more determined effort to win hearts and minds rather than kill suspected enemies .
he has also expressed a desire to show american leadership by embarking on new initiatives in three areas neglected by the bush administration : climate change , nuclear disarmament , and a ban on torture to show respect for international law like the geneva convention .
while those policy changes will no doubt be applauded in european capitals , the call for europe to do more during a phase of economic turmoil in helping the united states may not be greeted with enthusiasm .
the end of the unilateral bush era the obama administration will have no choice but to tackle several major challenges at once .
he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .
the heads of the other 26 allied governments will listen closely to obama 's speech for insights into his presidency , but his words are likely to be long on symbolism and short on substance since he will no doubt still be putting together his cabinet and foreign policy team . but he will surely show that america has turned the page on the bush presidency by declaring the era of unilateralism is over and that the united states will re-engage with the rest of the world , including direct talks with its enemies , by demonstrating an abiding commitment to diplomacy and the rule of international law .
dramatic difference opinion surveys show that this change is strongly supported by the american people , who have grown dismayed and disenchanted with the misbegotten military adventures of the neoconservative cabal that dominated bush 's foreign policy team .
in short , america and the world will probably wake up on the morning of nov .
5 to a dramatically different government taking over in the united states .
if obama can fulfill the hopes and ambitions of the millions of american voters yearning for change , he will go down in history books as a transformational leader who brought the united states back from the precipice of decline as a world power and restored its original sense of purpose as a stalwart defender of democratic values and human rights . william m. drozdiak has been the president of the american council on germany -lrb- acg -rrb- since february 2005 .
prior to that , he was the executive director of the transatlantic center of the german marshall fund of the united states .
in addition , he has worked as an editor and foreign correspondent for the washington post , time and the washington star , covering such historical events as the collapse of the soviet union , the first peace agreement between israel and egypt and the iran-iraq war .

even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .
more support from europe the global economic crisis has in some respects overwhelmed what was already a daunting foreign policy agenda .
james steinberg , the former deputy national security advisor in the clinton administration , is heading the transition team assigned to shaping the foreign and security policies and assembling the team that will carry them out .
obama has declared his intention to set a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq within 16 months of taking office and will try to move even more quickly in order to reassign forces to the conflict in afghanistan , where the taliban and their al-qaeda allies have been ascendant . in addition , obama will call on the european allies to assume greater responsibility in helping shape policies to combat terrorism that will put new emphasis on economic reconstruction rather than brute military force - in other words , a more determined effort to win hearts and minds rather than kill suspected enemies .
he has also expressed a desire to show american leadership by embarking on new initiatives in three areas neglected by the bush administration : climate change , nuclear disarmament , and a ban on torture to show respect for international law like the geneva convention .
while those policy changes will no doubt be applauded in european capitals , the call for europe to do more during a phase of economic turmoil in helping the united states may not be greeted with enthusiasm .
the end of the unilateral bush era the obama administration will have no choice but to tackle several major challenges at once .
he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .
the heads of the other 26 allied governments will listen closely to obama 's speech for insights into his presidency , but his words are likely to be long on symbolism and short on substance since he will no doubt still be putting together his cabinet and foreign policy team . but he will surely show that america has turned the page on the bush presidency by declaring the era of unilateralism is over and that the united states will re-engage with the rest of the world , including direct talks with its enemies , by demonstrating an abiding commitment to diplomacy and the rule of international law .
dramatic difference opinion surveys show that this change is strongly supported by the american people , who have grown dismayed and disenchanted with the misbegotten military adventures of the neoconservative cabal that dominated bush 's foreign policy team .
in short , america and the world will probably wake up on the morning of nov .
5 to a dramatically different government taking over in the united states .
if obama can fulfill the hopes and ambitions of the millions of american voters yearning for change , he will go down in history books as a transformational leader who brought the united states back from the precipice of decline as a world power and restored its original sense of purpose as a stalwart defender of democratic values and human rights . william m. drozdiak has been the president of the american council on germany -lrb- acg -rrb- since february 2005 .
prior to that , he was the executive director of the transatlantic center of the german marshall fund of the united states .
in addition , he has worked as an editor and foreign correspondent for the washington post , time and the washington star , covering such historical events as the collapse of the soviet union , the first peace agreement between israel and egypt and the iran-iraq war .
drozdiak was a professional basketball player in the us and europe between 1971 and 1978 . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government is planning to introduce a two-year , tax-free scheme for new environmentally-friendly cars .
but environmentalists have warned the plan will backfire because the criteria are not strict enough . " we want to introduce an automobile tax exemption for cars that are particularly clean , " environment minister sigmar gabriel told ard public television on thursday , oct .
30 .
" that is the proposal that the finance minister will present .
but we still need the approval of the federal states . " automobile taxes are raised by germany 's 16 states and gabriel said finance minister peer steinbrueck would negotiate with the states about how to make up for the resulting tax shortfall . " we of course do not want the states to shoulder the burden on their own , " gabriel said . the tax breaks are likely to last one or two years depending on the car 's particular specifications . criteria not strict enough , say environmentalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentally , japan is still putting the german car industry to shame environmentalists attacked the proposal saying the criteria for the tax exemption were so lax they would include most new cars including gas guzzlers such as sport utility vehicles , which since 2005 have had to meet new emissions standards . " petrol-thirsty automobiles with big motors will benefit , " the ngo german environmental aid said in a statement , calling chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition as " car-driven . " " this is a giant purchase incentive for climate killers , " it said . the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , juergen trittin , has attacked the move , saying the government was acting blindly .
he said cabinet members were organizing a sell-off of pollution-spewing gas guzzlers . " if people are to be encouraged to buy , then they have to promote the purchase of low-consumption cars - of vehicles that produce less than 120 gram of co2 per kilometer , " the former environment minister urged . the german newspaper rheinische post said the tax break would probably cost 2 billion euros in 2009 , citing government sources . older cars would not be eligible for the exemption , which gabriel said the cabinet planned to approve next wednesday and roll out on jan .
1 . gabriel said berlin aimed to eventually introduce a sliding scale for car tax pegged to the amount of carbon emissions that they produce rather than the size of their engines .
co2 emissions are blamed for driving global warming . german carmakers welcome the plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups say the proposal is nothing but a support for carmakers the car industry in both europe and the united states has been appealing to governments to act to revive sales in the financial-crisis struck sector .

he also added that the industry would welcome a tax based on the level of co2 emissions . with credit scarce and sales plunging , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen threw his weight on wednesday behind a call to give the bloc 's carmakers cheap loans worth up to 40 billion euros to invest in the development of eco-friendly cars during the financial crisis . the car industry is a key pillar of europe 's biggest economy , home to giants including volkswagen , bmw and porsche .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 30.10.2008 eu lawmakers demand hooker-free lodging großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the letter has drawn attention to a little-known issue a group of scandinavian european parliamentarians has called for the eu parliament in strasbourg to stop using hotels where prostitutes are allowed . the european parliament convenes most often in brussels , but once a month it meets in its official seat in strasbourg , france . each time the approximately 800 lawmakers and their staff arrive , the town on the french-german borders sees a boom in prostitution , the german daily news web site tagesschau asserts . now , a letter signed by 37 parliamentarians - mainly from scandinavian countries - is calling for the body to " only use hotels which issue a guarantee that the hotel is not involved in sex trade , and that all staff have written guidelines on this issue . " change of mentality " it 's a serious issue , " parliamentary spokesman jaume duch fridau told the afp news service earlier in the week .
fridau added that the letter had been passed on to parliament president hans-gert poettering . if the eu agrees to the demands of the letter , it would be aligning itself with a 2006 decision by the nordic council , which is made up of denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden .
the european deputies said such a decision could help tackle the problems of prostitution , organized crime , and human trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : streetwalkers are often victims of human trafficking " it requires a change of mentality " to end the situation where you have " hotels as providers of sex trade with humans , as if they were dealing with an ordinary commodity , " the letter claimed . organized crime was involved in " the increase in human trafficking where , for example , young women from poor countries are sold to a life as sex slaves in the prostitution industry , " the letter continued . union of values one of the letter 's signatories , swedish mep helene goudin , said it was also necessary to ban elected meps and their staff from using hotels that air pornographic films in their bedrooms . " we are against the exploitation of women in general , " she told afp .
" the european union is a union of values and we thing we should reach agreement on this subject . " the letter was not raising the question of whether or not prostitution should be made legal , according to its instigator , danish parliamentarian karin riis joergensen . " it is simply about the fact that during the strasburg parliamentary weeks , we do n't want to go into hotels where there are prostitutes , " she told tagesschau.de .
lawmakers who want to set up parties with prostitutes should go elsewhere , she said .
" but not in the same hotels with us .
we just want clean hotels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovely strasbourg , surrounded by a shady ring road the reaction to the demands has been low-key so far .
bavarian eu lawmaker manfred ferber told tagesschau he was " surprised , at first , that there was such a letter . " lawmakers worry about reputation " i 've been in the same hotel for more than 11 years and have n't noticed anything up to now , " he said . ferber is one of many parliamentarians who worry that the uproar wo n't do so much to fight prostitution as it will to blemish the reputation of eu lawmakers in the eyes of their constituents . but the fact remains that the small french city is a center for the illegal sex trade , according to tagesschau .
the site reports that a ring road that surrounds the old town is one long red-light district , populated mostly by eastern european prostitutes - many of whom are there unwillingly . meanwhile , europeans are anything but unified on how to deal with prostitution .
does it make more sense to outlaw it , like denmark does ?
to limit it , like they do in france ?
or do the germans , who have legalized the trade , have the right idea ?

champions bayern munich rose to fourth place with 18 points from their third straight win , a 2-1 comeback effort at eintracht frankfurt from miroslav klose and franck ribery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim scored all three goals within six minutes hoffenheim remained the toast of the league even though they were shocked just two minutes into the game in bochum when grote fired a low shot into the net from the edge of the area .
it took hoffenheim until the 65th minute to level , from a neat back-heeler by ba , and the visitors then went on the roll yet again to claim their fourth straight victory .
league top scorer ibisevic raised his tally to 11 with a 70th-minute penalty after grote had brought down andreas beck .
eduardo wrapped up matters just 60 seconds later and bochum 's frustration showed when dabrowski had to leave for a second bookable offence in the 76th .
" it took us a while to get into the game .
but we have played quite well so far in the season and aim to keep going , " said beck .
munich pulls ahead for win munich also had to come from behind to beat frankfurt , who were coming off their first two season wins and took a 55th-minute lead against the flow of play from an own goal by martin demichelis .
but ribery fed klose for the equalizer in the 63rd and the frenchman got the winning volley in the 70th to sooth the nerves of coach juergen klinsmann .
" it was important to show a strong reaction after the own goal .
we showed that we are a team which can attack , " said munich midfielder tim borowski .
former leaders hamburg , meanwhile , recovered well from sunday 's 3-0 loss in hoffenheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery -lrb- right -rrb- helped munich to their third straight win germany midfielder poitr triochowski opened the scoring with a 17th-minute penalty , guy demel was denied by the bar late in the first half but a deflected shot from joris mathijsen clinched hamburg 's win in the 74th .
" it was n't our best game but the main thing is that we won , " said hamburg sports director dietmar beiersdorfer .

mandela went on to become the country 's first democratic president in 1994 .

mandela went on to become the country 's first democratic president in 1994 .
" at the beginning of the 1990s , i had prepared a project in soweto , " wallraff said in a speech to a full house at the goethe institute in johannesburg on wednesday , oct .
29 .
south african writer breyten breytenbach , who himself had spent years in south african prison for his own activities against the apartheid government , had helped him plan the project , according to wallraff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandela 's release from jail shelved wallraff 's project he went on to describe how he always tested his disguises on his own daughters before reading excerpts from his next book about the " new " working world and from his autobiography .
" everything is in question " guenter wallraff , whose 1985 book " lowest of the low " documented the work and living conditions of turkish guest workers in germany , also warned his audience of the worsening work conditions in german companies .
" fear is spreading in the factories , no one dares to speak up .
we live in a time where everything is in question , " wallraff said .
wallraff said the global finance crisis in the markets signaled not only an economic crisis but also a crisis through the whole system , and said he hoped it would provide the basis for a new " age of moderation and values . "
wallraff also announced he was setting up a foundation named after himself to help young journalists uncover injustices in the workplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks against foreigners outside johannesburg in may are worth further investigation , said wallraff asked what he would do as a south african investigative journalist , wallraff said : " i would probably live in alexandra , where the anti-foreigner pogroms took place . "
he was referring to the township outside johannesburg where south africans killed at least 60 refugees as the situation worsened in neighboring zimbabwe .
many of the victims were zimbabweans .

instead , the roman catholic archbishop who is the most outspoken of germany 's 27 diocesan leaders in his criticism of big business , says that his work is to some extent " an argument with marxism . " the book begins as a letter addressed to his " dear namesake . " " the consequences , " he tells the 19th-century ideologist , " of your thinking were disastrous .

5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page . with opinion polls showing barack obama expanding his lead over john mccain just days before the united states presidential election , attention is turning to what kind of policies obama will try to execute if and when he occupies the white house after inauguration day on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william drozdiak already , this presidential transition is shaping up as one of the most difficult in american history : the next president will inherit two wars in iraq and afghanistan , potential showdowns over nuclear threats from iran and north korea , a newly aggressive russia , and a financial crisis worse than anything since the great depression .
even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .
more support from europe the global economic crisis has in some respects overwhelmed what was already a daunting foreign policy agenda .
james steinberg , the former deputy national security advisor in the clinton administration , is heading the transition team assigned to shaping the foreign and security policies and assembling the team that will carry them out .
obama has declared his intention to set a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq within 16 months of taking office and will try to move even more quickly in order to reassign forces to the conflict in afghanistan , where the taliban and their al-qaeda allies have been ascendant . in addition , obama will call on the european allies to assume greater responsibility in helping shape policies to combat terrorism that will put new emphasis on economic reconstruction rather than brute military force - in other words , a more determined effort to win hearts and minds rather than kill suspected enemies .
he has also expressed a desire to show american leadership by embarking on new initiatives in three areas neglected by the bush administration : climate change , nuclear disarmament , and a ban on torture to show respect for international law like the geneva convention .
while those policy changes will no doubt be applauded in european capitals , the call for europe to do more during a phase of economic turmoil in helping the united states may not be greeted with enthusiasm .
the end of the unilateral bush era the obama administration will have no choice but to tackle several major challenges at once .
he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .
the heads of the other 26 allied governments will listen closely to obama 's speech for insights into his presidency , but his words are likely to be long on symbolism and short on substance since he will no doubt still be putting together his cabinet and foreign policy team . but he will surely show that america has turned the page on the bush presidency by declaring the era of unilateralism is over and that the united states will re-engage with the rest of the world , including direct talks with its enemies , by demonstrating an abiding commitment to diplomacy and the rule of international law .
dramatic difference opinion surveys show that this change is strongly supported by the american people , who have grown dismayed and disenchanted with the misbegotten military adventures of the neoconservative cabal that dominated bush 's foreign policy team .
in short , america and the world will probably wake up on the morning of nov .
5 to a dramatically different government taking over in the united states .
if obama can fulfill the hopes and ambitions of the millions of american voters yearning for change , he will go down in history books as a transformational leader who brought the united states back from the precipice of decline as a world power and restored its original sense of purpose as a stalwart defender of democratic values and human rights . william m. drozdiak has been the president of the american council on germany -lrb- acg -rrb- since february 2005 .

he has also expressed a desire to show american leadership by embarking on new initiatives in three areas neglected by the bush administration : climate change , nuclear disarmament , and a ban on torture to show respect for international law like the geneva convention .

he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .

dramatic difference opinion surveys show that this change is strongly supported by the american people , who have grown dismayed and disenchanted with the misbegotten military adventures of the neoconservative cabal that dominated bush 's foreign policy team .

5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page . with opinion polls showing barack obama expanding his lead over john mccain just days before the united states presidential election , attention is turning to what kind of policies obama will try to execute if and when he occupies the white house after inauguration day on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william drozdiak already , this presidential transition is shaping up as one of the most difficult in american history : the next president will inherit two wars in iraq and afghanistan , potential showdowns over nuclear threats from iran and north korea , a newly aggressive russia , and a financial crisis worse than anything since the great depression .
even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .
more support from europe the global economic crisis has in some respects overwhelmed what was already a daunting foreign policy agenda .
james steinberg , the former deputy national security advisor in the clinton administration , is heading the transition team assigned to shaping the foreign and security policies and assembling the team that will carry them out .
obama has declared his intention to set a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq within 16 months of taking office and will try to move even more quickly in order to reassign forces to the conflict in afghanistan , where the taliban and their al-qaeda allies have been ascendant . in addition , obama will call on the european allies to assume greater responsibility in helping shape policies to combat terrorism that will put new emphasis on economic reconstruction rather than brute military force - in other words , a more determined effort to win hearts and minds rather than kill suspected enemies .
he has also expressed a desire to show american leadership by embarking on new initiatives in three areas neglected by the bush administration : climate change , nuclear disarmament , and a ban on torture to show respect for international law like the geneva convention .
while those policy changes will no doubt be applauded in european capitals , the call for europe to do more during a phase of economic turmoil in helping the united states may not be greeted with enthusiasm .
the end of the unilateral bush era the obama administration will have no choice but to tackle several major challenges at once .
he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .

" change of mentality " it 's a serious issue , " parliamentary spokesman jaume duch fridau told the afp news service earlier in the week .
fridau added that the letter had been passed on to parliament president hans-gert poettering . if the eu agrees to the demands of the letter , it would be aligning itself with a 2006 decision by the nordic council , which is made up of denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden .
the european deputies said such a decision could help tackle the problems of prostitution , organized crime , and human trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : streetwalkers are often victims of human trafficking " it requires a change of mentality " to end the situation where you have " hotels as providers of sex trade with humans , as if they were dealing with an ordinary commodity , " the letter claimed . organized crime was involved in " the increase in human trafficking where , for example , young women from poor countries are sold to a life as sex slaves in the prostitution industry , " the letter continued . union of values one of the letter 's signatories , swedish mep helene goudin , said it was also necessary to ban elected meps and their staff from using hotels that air pornographic films in their bedrooms . " we are against the exploitation of women in general , " she told afp .
" the european union is a union of values and we thing we should reach agreement on this subject . " the letter was not raising the question of whether or not prostitution should be made legal , according to its instigator , danish parliamentarian karin riis joergensen . " it is simply about the fact that during the strasburg parliamentary weeks , we do n't want to go into hotels where there are prostitutes , " she told tagesschau.de .
lawmakers who want to set up parties with prostitutes should go elsewhere , she said .
" but not in the same hotels with us .
we just want clean hotels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovely strasbourg , surrounded by a shady ring road the reaction to the demands has been low-key so far .
bavarian eu lawmaker manfred ferber told tagesschau he was " surprised , at first , that there was such a letter . " lawmakers worry about reputation " i 've been in the same hotel for more than 11 years and have n't noticed anything up to now , " he said . ferber is one of many parliamentarians who worry that the uproar wo n't do so much to fight prostitution as it will to blemish the reputation of eu lawmakers in the eyes of their constituents . but the fact remains that the small french city is a center for the illegal sex trade , according to tagesschau .
the site reports that a ring road that surrounds the old town is one long red-light district , populated mostly by eastern european prostitutes - many of whom are there unwillingly . meanwhile , europeans are anything but unified on how to deal with prostitution .
does it make more sense to outlaw it , like denmark does ?
to limit it , like they do in france ?
or do the germans , who have legalized the trade , have the right idea ?

" change of mentality " it 's a serious issue , " parliamentary spokesman jaume duch fridau told the afp news service earlier in the week .
fridau added that the letter had been passed on to parliament president hans-gert poettering . if the eu agrees to the demands of the letter , it would be aligning itself with a 2006 decision by the nordic council , which is made up of denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden .
the european deputies said such a decision could help tackle the problems of prostitution , organized crime , and human trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : streetwalkers are often victims of human trafficking " it requires a change of mentality " to end the situation where you have " hotels as providers of sex trade with humans , as if they were dealing with an ordinary commodity , " the letter claimed . organized crime was involved in " the increase in human trafficking where , for example , young women from poor countries are sold to a life as sex slaves in the prostitution industry , " the letter continued . union of values one of the letter 's signatories , swedish mep helene goudin , said it was also necessary to ban elected meps and their staff from using hotels that air pornographic films in their bedrooms . " we are against the exploitation of women in general , " she told afp .
" the european union is a union of values and we thing we should reach agreement on this subject . " the letter was not raising the question of whether or not prostitution should be made legal , according to its instigator , danish parliamentarian karin riis joergensen . " it is simply about the fact that during the strasburg parliamentary weeks , we do n't want to go into hotels where there are prostitutes , " she told tagesschau.de .
lawmakers who want to set up parties with prostitutes should go elsewhere , she said .
" but not in the same hotels with us .
we just want clean hotels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovely strasbourg , surrounded by a shady ring road the reaction to the demands has been low-key so far .
bavarian eu lawmaker manfred ferber told tagesschau he was " surprised , at first , that there was such a letter . " lawmakers worry about reputation " i 've been in the same hotel for more than 11 years and have n't noticed anything up to now , " he said . ferber is one of many parliamentarians who worry that the uproar wo n't do so much to fight prostitution as it will to blemish the reputation of eu lawmakers in the eyes of their constituents . but the fact remains that the small french city is a center for the illegal sex trade , according to tagesschau .
the site reports that a ring road that surrounds the old town is one long red-light district , populated mostly by eastern european prostitutes - many of whom are there unwillingly . meanwhile , europeans are anything but unified on how to deal with prostitution .
does it make more sense to outlaw it , like denmark does ?
to limit it , like they do in france ?
or do the germans , who have legalized the trade , have the right idea ?
each eu state has its own laws on the books - making it all the more difficult to fight against human trafficking . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government is planning to introduce a two-year , tax-free scheme for new environmentally-friendly cars .
but environmentalists have warned the plan will backfire because the criteria are not strict enough . " we want to introduce an automobile tax exemption for cars that are particularly clean , " environment minister sigmar gabriel told ard public television on thursday , oct .
30 .
" that is the proposal that the finance minister will present .
but we still need the approval of the federal states . " automobile taxes are raised by germany 's 16 states and gabriel said finance minister peer steinbrueck would negotiate with the states about how to make up for the resulting tax shortfall . " we of course do not want the states to shoulder the burden on their own , " gabriel said . the tax breaks are likely to last one or two years depending on the car 's particular specifications . criteria not strict enough , say environmentalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentally , japan is still putting the german car industry to shame environmentalists attacked the proposal saying the criteria for the tax exemption were so lax they would include most new cars including gas guzzlers such as sport utility vehicles , which since 2005 have had to meet new emissions standards . " petrol-thirsty automobiles with big motors will benefit , " the ngo german environmental aid said in a statement , calling chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition as " car-driven . " " this is a giant purchase incentive for climate killers , " it said . the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , juergen trittin , has attacked the move , saying the government was acting blindly .
he said cabinet members were organizing a sell-off of pollution-spewing gas guzzlers . " if people are to be encouraged to buy , then they have to promote the purchase of low-consumption cars - of vehicles that produce less than 120 gram of co2 per kilometer , " the former environment minister urged . the german newspaper rheinische post said the tax break would probably cost 2 billion euros in 2009 , citing government sources . older cars would not be eligible for the exemption , which gabriel said the cabinet planned to approve next wednesday and roll out on jan .
1 . gabriel said berlin aimed to eventually introduce a sliding scale for car tax pegged to the amount of carbon emissions that they produce rather than the size of their engines .
co2 emissions are blamed for driving global warming . german carmakers welcome the plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups say the proposal is nothing but a support for carmakers the car industry in both europe and the united states has been appealing to governments to act to revive sales in the financial-crisis struck sector .
the vda , the german automobile industry 's biggest interest group , welcomed the plan . " the tax holiday proposed today for new cars can provide an impetus to spur sales of vehicles , stabilize the economy and thus ensure jobs in germany , " vda president matthias wissmann said in a statement .
he also added that the industry would welcome a tax based on the level of co2 emissions . with credit scarce and sales plunging , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen threw his weight on wednesday behind a call to give the bloc 's carmakers cheap loans worth up to 40 billion euros to invest in the development of eco-friendly cars during the financial crisis . the car industry is a key pillar of europe 's biggest economy , home to giants including volkswagen , bmw and porsche .
up to now , the sector has been rather resistant to moving away from its traditional niche market of large , luxury cars with big engines . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government is planning to introduce a two-year , tax-free scheme for new environmentally-friendly cars .
but environmentalists have warned the plan will backfire because the criteria are not strict enough . " we want to introduce an automobile tax exemption for cars that are particularly clean , " environment minister sigmar gabriel told ard public television on thursday , oct .
30 .
" that is the proposal that the finance minister will present .
but we still need the approval of the federal states . " automobile taxes are raised by germany 's 16 states and gabriel said finance minister peer steinbrueck would negotiate with the states about how to make up for the resulting tax shortfall . " we of course do not want the states to shoulder the burden on their own , " gabriel said . the tax breaks are likely to last one or two years depending on the car 's particular specifications . criteria not strict enough , say environmentalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentally , japan is still putting the german car industry to shame environmentalists attacked the proposal saying the criteria for the tax exemption were so lax they would include most new cars including gas guzzlers such as sport utility vehicles , which since 2005 have had to meet new emissions standards . " petrol-thirsty automobiles with big motors will benefit , " the ngo german environmental aid said in a statement , calling chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition as " car-driven . " " this is a giant purchase incentive for climate killers , " it said . the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , juergen trittin , has attacked the move , saying the government was acting blindly .
he said cabinet members were organizing a sell-off of pollution-spewing gas guzzlers . " if people are to be encouraged to buy , then they have to promote the purchase of low-consumption cars - of vehicles that produce less than 120 gram of co2 per kilometer , " the former environment minister urged . the german newspaper rheinische post said the tax break would probably cost 2 billion euros in 2009 , citing government sources . older cars would not be eligible for the exemption , which gabriel said the cabinet planned to approve next wednesday and roll out on jan .
1 . gabriel said berlin aimed to eventually introduce a sliding scale for car tax pegged to the amount of carbon emissions that they produce rather than the size of their engines .
co2 emissions are blamed for driving global warming . german carmakers welcome the plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups say the proposal is nothing but a support for carmakers the car industry in both europe and the united states has been appealing to governments to act to revive sales in the financial-crisis struck sector .
the vda , the german automobile industry 's biggest interest group , welcomed the plan . " the tax holiday proposed today for new cars can provide an impetus to spur sales of vehicles , stabilize the economy and thus ensure jobs in germany , " vda president matthias wissmann said in a statement .
he also added that the industry would welcome a tax based on the level of co2 emissions . with credit scarce and sales plunging , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen threw his weight on wednesday behind a call to give the bloc 's carmakers cheap loans worth up to 40 billion euros to invest in the development of eco-friendly cars during the financial crisis . the car industry is a key pillar of europe 's biggest economy , home to giants including volkswagen , bmw and porsche .
up to now , the sector has been rather resistant to moving away from its traditional niche market of large , luxury cars with big engines . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government is planning to introduce a two-year , tax-free scheme for new environmentally-friendly cars .
but environmentalists have warned the plan will backfire because the criteria are not strict enough . " we want to introduce an automobile tax exemption for cars that are particularly clean , " environment minister sigmar gabriel told ard public television on thursday , oct .
30 .
" that is the proposal that the finance minister will present .
but we still need the approval of the federal states . " automobile taxes are raised by germany 's 16 states and gabriel said finance minister peer steinbrueck would negotiate with the states about how to make up for the resulting tax shortfall . " we of course do not want the states to shoulder the burden on their own , " gabriel said . the tax breaks are likely to last one or two years depending on the car 's particular specifications . criteria not strict enough , say environmentalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentally , japan is still putting the german car industry to shame environmentalists attacked the proposal saying the criteria for the tax exemption were so lax they would include most new cars including gas guzzlers such as sport utility vehicles , which since 2005 have had to meet new emissions standards . " petrol-thirsty automobiles with big motors will benefit , " the ngo german environmental aid said in a statement , calling chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition as " car-driven . " " this is a giant purchase incentive for climate killers , " it said . the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , juergen trittin , has attacked the move , saying the government was acting blindly .
he said cabinet members were organizing a sell-off of pollution-spewing gas guzzlers . " if people are to be encouraged to buy , then they have to promote the purchase of low-consumption cars - of vehicles that produce less than 120 gram of co2 per kilometer , " the former environment minister urged . the german newspaper rheinische post said the tax break would probably cost 2 billion euros in 2009 , citing government sources . older cars would not be eligible for the exemption , which gabriel said the cabinet planned to approve next wednesday and roll out on jan .
1 . gabriel said berlin aimed to eventually introduce a sliding scale for car tax pegged to the amount of carbon emissions that they produce rather than the size of their engines .
co2 emissions are blamed for driving global warming . german carmakers welcome the plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups say the proposal is nothing but a support for carmakers the car industry in both europe and the united states has been appealing to governments to act to revive sales in the financial-crisis struck sector .
the vda , the german automobile industry 's biggest interest group , welcomed the plan . " the tax holiday proposed today for new cars can provide an impetus to spur sales of vehicles , stabilize the economy and thus ensure jobs in germany , " vda president matthias wissmann said in a statement .
he also added that the industry would welcome a tax based on the level of co2 emissions . with credit scarce and sales plunging , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen threw his weight on wednesday behind a call to give the bloc 's carmakers cheap loans worth up to 40 billion euros to invest in the development of eco-friendly cars during the financial crisis . the car industry is a key pillar of europe 's biggest economy , home to giants including volkswagen , bmw and porsche .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 30.10.2008 opinion : obama will go down in history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if barack obama is elected , the us will wake up to a dramatically different government on nov .
5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page . with opinion polls showing barack obama expanding his lead over john mccain just days before the united states presidential election , attention is turning to what kind of policies obama will try to execute if and when he occupies the white house after inauguration day on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william drozdiak already , this presidential transition is shaping up as one of the most difficult in american history : the next president will inherit two wars in iraq and afghanistan , potential showdowns over nuclear threats from iran and north korea , a newly aggressive russia , and a financial crisis worse than anything since the great depression .
even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .
more support from europe the global economic crisis has in some respects overwhelmed what was already a daunting foreign policy agenda .
james steinberg , the former deputy national security advisor in the clinton administration , is heading the transition team assigned to shaping the foreign and security policies and assembling the team that will carry them out .
obama has declared his intention to set a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq within 16 months of taking office and will try to move even more quickly in order to reassign forces to the conflict in afghanistan , where the taliban and their al-qaeda allies have been ascendant . in addition , obama will call on the european allies to assume greater responsibility in helping shape policies to combat terrorism that will put new emphasis on economic reconstruction rather than brute military force - in other words , a more determined effort to win hearts and minds rather than kill suspected enemies .
he has also expressed a desire to show american leadership by embarking on new initiatives in three areas neglected by the bush administration : climate change , nuclear disarmament , and a ban on torture to show respect for international law like the geneva convention .
while those policy changes will no doubt be applauded in european capitals , the call for europe to do more during a phase of economic turmoil in helping the united states may not be greeted with enthusiasm .
the end of the unilateral bush era the obama administration will have no choice but to tackle several major challenges at once .
he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .
the heads of the other 26 allied governments will listen closely to obama 's speech for insights into his presidency , but his words are likely to be long on symbolism and short on substance since he will no doubt still be putting together his cabinet and foreign policy team . but he will surely show that america has turned the page on the bush presidency by declaring the era of unilateralism is over and that the united states will re-engage with the rest of the world , including direct talks with its enemies , by demonstrating an abiding commitment to diplomacy and the rule of international law .
dramatic difference opinion surveys show that this change is strongly supported by the american people , who have grown dismayed and disenchanted with the misbegotten military adventures of the neoconservative cabal that dominated bush 's foreign policy team .
in short , america and the world will probably wake up on the morning of nov .
5 to a dramatically different government taking over in the united states .
if obama can fulfill the hopes and ambitions of the millions of american voters yearning for change , he will go down in history books as a transformational leader who brought the united states back from the precipice of decline as a world power and restored its original sense of purpose as a stalwart defender of democratic values and human rights . william m. drozdiak has been the president of the american council on germany -lrb- acg -rrb- since february 2005 .
prior to that , he was the executive director of the transatlantic center of the german marshall fund of the united states .
in addition , he has worked as an editor and foreign correspondent for the washington post , time and the washington star , covering such historical events as the collapse of the soviet union , the first peace agreement between israel and egypt and the iran-iraq war .
drozdiak was a professional basketball player in the us and europe between 1971 and 1978 . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while those policy changes will no doubt be applauded in european capitals , the call for europe to do more during a phase of economic turmoil in helping the united states may not be greeted with enthusiasm .
the end of the unilateral bush era the obama administration will have no choice but to tackle several major challenges at once .
he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .
the heads of the other 26 allied governments will listen closely to obama 's speech for insights into his presidency , but his words are likely to be long on symbolism and short on substance since he will no doubt still be putting together his cabinet and foreign policy team . but he will surely show that america has turned the page on the bush presidency by declaring the era of unilateralism is over and that the united states will re-engage with the rest of the world , including direct talks with its enemies , by demonstrating an abiding commitment to diplomacy and the rule of international law .
dramatic difference opinion surveys show that this change is strongly supported by the american people , who have grown dismayed and disenchanted with the misbegotten military adventures of the neoconservative cabal that dominated bush 's foreign policy team .
in short , america and the world will probably wake up on the morning of nov .
5 to a dramatically different government taking over in the united states .

5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page . with opinion polls showing barack obama expanding his lead over john mccain just days before the united states presidential election , attention is turning to what kind of policies obama will try to execute if and when he occupies the white house after inauguration day on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william drozdiak already , this presidential transition is shaping up as one of the most difficult in american history : the next president will inherit two wars in iraq and afghanistan , potential showdowns over nuclear threats from iran and north korea , a newly aggressive russia , and a financial crisis worse than anything since the great depression .
even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .
more support from europe the global economic crisis has in some respects overwhelmed what was already a daunting foreign policy agenda .
james steinberg , the former deputy national security advisor in the clinton administration , is heading the transition team assigned to shaping the foreign and security policies and assembling the team that will carry them out .
obama has declared his intention to set a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq within 16 months of taking office and will try to move even more quickly in order to reassign forces to the conflict in afghanistan , where the taliban and their al-qaeda allies have been ascendant . in addition , obama will call on the european allies to assume greater responsibility in helping shape policies to combat terrorism that will put new emphasis on economic reconstruction rather than brute military force - in other words , a more determined effort to win hearts and minds rather than kill suspected enemies .

5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page . with opinion polls showing barack obama expanding his lead over john mccain just days before the united states presidential election , attention is turning to what kind of policies obama will try to execute if and when he occupies the white house after inauguration day on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william drozdiak already , this presidential transition is shaping up as one of the most difficult in american history : the next president will inherit two wars in iraq and afghanistan , potential showdowns over nuclear threats from iran and north korea , a newly aggressive russia , and a financial crisis worse than anything since the great depression .
even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .
more support from europe the global economic crisis has in some respects overwhelmed what was already a daunting foreign policy agenda .
james steinberg , the former deputy national security advisor in the clinton administration , is heading the transition team assigned to shaping the foreign and security policies and assembling the team that will carry them out .
obama has declared his intention to set a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq within 16 months of taking office and will try to move even more quickly in order to reassign forces to the conflict in afghanistan , where the taliban and their al-qaeda allies have been ascendant . in addition , obama will call on the european allies to assume greater responsibility in helping shape policies to combat terrorism that will put new emphasis on economic reconstruction rather than brute military force - in other words , a more determined effort to win hearts and minds rather than kill suspected enemies .
he has also expressed a desire to show american leadership by embarking on new initiatives in three areas neglected by the bush administration : climate change , nuclear disarmament , and a ban on torture to show respect for international law like the geneva convention .
while those policy changes will no doubt be applauded in european capitals , the call for europe to do more during a phase of economic turmoil in helping the united states may not be greeted with enthusiasm .
the end of the unilateral bush era the obama administration will have no choice but to tackle several major challenges at once .
he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .
the heads of the other 26 allied governments will listen closely to obama 's speech for insights into his presidency , but his words are likely to be long on symbolism and short on substance since he will no doubt still be putting together his cabinet and foreign policy team . but he will surely show that america has turned the page on the bush presidency by declaring the era of unilateralism is over and that the united states will re-engage with the rest of the world , including direct talks with its enemies , by demonstrating an abiding commitment to diplomacy and the rule of international law .
dramatic difference opinion surveys show that this change is strongly supported by the american people , who have grown dismayed and disenchanted with the misbegotten military adventures of the neoconservative cabal that dominated bush 's foreign policy team .
in short , america and the world will probably wake up on the morning of nov .
5 to a dramatically different government taking over in the united states .
if obama can fulfill the hopes and ambitions of the millions of american voters yearning for change , he will go down in history books as a transformational leader who brought the united states back from the precipice of decline as a world power and restored its original sense of purpose as a stalwart defender of democratic values and human rights . william m. drozdiak has been the president of the american council on germany -lrb- acg -rrb- since february 2005 .
prior to that , he was the executive director of the transatlantic center of the german marshall fund of the united states .
in addition , he has worked as an editor and foreign correspondent for the washington post , time and the washington star , covering such historical events as the collapse of the soviet union , the first peace agreement between israel and egypt and the iran-iraq war .

but environmentalists have warned the plan will backfire because the criteria are not strict enough . " we want to introduce an automobile tax exemption for cars that are particularly clean , " environment minister sigmar gabriel told ard public television on thursday , oct .
30 .
" that is the proposal that the finance minister will present .
but we still need the approval of the federal states . " automobile taxes are raised by germany 's 16 states and gabriel said finance minister peer steinbrueck would negotiate with the states about how to make up for the resulting tax shortfall . " we of course do not want the states to shoulder the burden on their own , " gabriel said . the tax breaks are likely to last one or two years depending on the car 's particular specifications . criteria not strict enough , say environmentalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentally , japan is still putting the german car industry to shame environmentalists attacked the proposal saying the criteria for the tax exemption were so lax they would include most new cars including gas guzzlers such as sport utility vehicles , which since 2005 have had to meet new emissions standards . " petrol-thirsty automobiles with big motors will benefit , " the ngo german environmental aid said in a statement , calling chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition as " car-driven . " " this is a giant purchase incentive for climate killers , " it said . the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , juergen trittin , has attacked the move , saying the government was acting blindly .
he said cabinet members were organizing a sell-off of pollution-spewing gas guzzlers . " if people are to be encouraged to buy , then they have to promote the purchase of low-consumption cars - of vehicles that produce less than 120 gram of co2 per kilometer , " the former environment minister urged . the german newspaper rheinische post said the tax break would probably cost 2 billion euros in 2009 , citing government sources . older cars would not be eligible for the exemption , which gabriel said the cabinet planned to approve next wednesday and roll out on jan .
1 . gabriel said berlin aimed to eventually introduce a sliding scale for car tax pegged to the amount of carbon emissions that they produce rather than the size of their engines .
co2 emissions are blamed for driving global warming . german carmakers welcome the plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups say the proposal is nothing but a support for carmakers the car industry in both europe and the united states has been appealing to governments to act to revive sales in the financial-crisis struck sector .
the vda , the german automobile industry 's biggest interest group , welcomed the plan . " the tax holiday proposed today for new cars can provide an impetus to spur sales of vehicles , stabilize the economy and thus ensure jobs in germany , " vda president matthias wissmann said in a statement .
he also added that the industry would welcome a tax based on the level of co2 emissions . with credit scarce and sales plunging , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen threw his weight on wednesday behind a call to give the bloc 's carmakers cheap loans worth up to 40 billion euros to invest in the development of eco-friendly cars during the financial crisis . the car industry is a key pillar of europe 's biggest economy , home to giants including volkswagen , bmw and porsche .
up to now , the sector has been rather resistant to moving away from its traditional niche market of large , luxury cars with big engines . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" change of mentality " it 's a serious issue , " parliamentary spokesman jaume duch fridau told the afp news service earlier in the week .
fridau added that the letter had been passed on to parliament president hans-gert poettering . if the eu agrees to the demands of the letter , it would be aligning itself with a 2006 decision by the nordic council , which is made up of denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden .

" it is simply about the fact that during the strasburg parliamentary weeks , we do n't want to go into hotels where there are prostitutes , " she told tagesschau.de .

" but not in the same hotels with us .
we just want clean hotels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovely strasbourg , surrounded by a shady ring road the reaction to the demands has been low-key so far .
bavarian eu lawmaker manfred ferber told tagesschau he was " surprised , at first , that there was such a letter . " lawmakers worry about reputation " i 've been in the same hotel for more than 11 years and have n't noticed anything up to now , " he said . ferber is one of many parliamentarians who worry that the uproar wo n't do so much to fight prostitution as it will to blemish the reputation of eu lawmakers in the eyes of their constituents . but the fact remains that the small french city is a center for the illegal sex trade , according to tagesschau .
the site reports that a ring road that surrounds the old town is one long red-light district , populated mostly by eastern european prostitutes - many of whom are there unwillingly . meanwhile , europeans are anything but unified on how to deal with prostitution .

german book publishers denounced a historic accord between google and us authors , dubbing it trick that would make the us company the master of the world 's knowledge . the boersenverein , the german booksellers and publishers association which has bitterly opposed google for years , rejected the accord as a " creeping takeover . " " this accord is like a trojan horse , " alexander skipis , chief executive of the boersenverein , said in a statement on thursday , oct .

" google aims to achieve worldwide control of knowledge and culture . " in the name of cultural diversity , this american model is out of the question for europe , " he said , adding that it contradicted " the european ideal of diversity through competition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has already digitized some 7 million books the boersenverein has funded a pay-for-use book-scanning service for german-language books , libreka . google , which has scanned 7 million books to include their contents in its internet search engine , announced tuesday it would let us users read the pages of books that are out of print but are still in copyright . under the settlement with the us authors guild and the association of american publishers , royalties will be paid for past and future use of the books by google . millions of the books are outdated and their authors dead , so a google-funded book registry will be set up to discover who now owns the copyrights .
google said it hoped to reach similar deals to benefit europe and asia . in the united states the google accord has been widely welcomed , since the bulk of books existing today are hard to obtain , as they are no longer on sale and uneconomic to reprint though their copyrights have not expired . at us public libraries , those books from recent decades will be visible in their entirety on library computers , while 20 per cent of those books will be visible to home users . for readers in the rest of the world , google will only be showing about two lines of text at a time . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page . with opinion polls showing barack obama expanding his lead over john mccain just days before the united states presidential election , attention is turning to what kind of policies obama will try to execute if and when he occupies the white house after inauguration day on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william drozdiak already , this presidential transition is shaping up as one of the most difficult in american history : the next president will inherit two wars in iraq and afghanistan , potential showdowns over nuclear threats from iran and north korea , a newly aggressive russia , and a financial crisis worse than anything since the great depression .
even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .
more support from europe the global economic crisis has in some respects overwhelmed what was already a daunting foreign policy agenda .
james steinberg , the former deputy national security advisor in the clinton administration , is heading the transition team assigned to shaping the foreign and security policies and assembling the team that will carry them out .
obama has declared his intention to set a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq within 16 months of taking office and will try to move even more quickly in order to reassign forces to the conflict in afghanistan , where the taliban and their al-qaeda allies have been ascendant . in addition , obama will call on the european allies to assume greater responsibility in helping shape policies to combat terrorism that will put new emphasis on economic reconstruction rather than brute military force - in other words , a more determined effort to win hearts and minds rather than kill suspected enemies .
he has also expressed a desire to show american leadership by embarking on new initiatives in three areas neglected by the bush administration : climate change , nuclear disarmament , and a ban on torture to show respect for international law like the geneva convention .
while those policy changes will no doubt be applauded in european capitals , the call for europe to do more during a phase of economic turmoil in helping the united states may not be greeted with enthusiasm .
the end of the unilateral bush era the obama administration will have no choice but to tackle several major challenges at once .
he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .
the heads of the other 26 allied governments will listen closely to obama 's speech for insights into his presidency , but his words are likely to be long on symbolism and short on substance since he will no doubt still be putting together his cabinet and foreign policy team . but he will surely show that america has turned the page on the bush presidency by declaring the era of unilateralism is over and that the united states will re-engage with the rest of the world , including direct talks with its enemies , by demonstrating an abiding commitment to diplomacy and the rule of international law .
dramatic difference opinion surveys show that this change is strongly supported by the american people , who have grown dismayed and disenchanted with the misbegotten military adventures of the neoconservative cabal that dominated bush 's foreign policy team .
in short , america and the world will probably wake up on the morning of nov .
5 to a dramatically different government taking over in the united states .
if obama can fulfill the hopes and ambitions of the millions of american voters yearning for change , he will go down in history books as a transformational leader who brought the united states back from the precipice of decline as a world power and restored its original sense of purpose as a stalwart defender of democratic values and human rights . william m. drozdiak has been the president of the american council on germany -lrb- acg -rrb- since february 2005 .
prior to that , he was the executive director of the transatlantic center of the german marshall fund of the united states .
in addition , he has worked as an editor and foreign correspondent for the washington post , time and the washington star , covering such historical events as the collapse of the soviet union , the first peace agreement between israel and egypt and the iran-iraq war .

5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page . with opinion polls showing barack obama expanding his lead over john mccain just days before the united states presidential election , attention is turning to what kind of policies obama will try to execute if and when he occupies the white house after inauguration day on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william drozdiak already , this presidential transition is shaping up as one of the most difficult in american history : the next president will inherit two wars in iraq and afghanistan , potential showdowns over nuclear threats from iran and north korea , a newly aggressive russia , and a financial crisis worse than anything since the great depression .
even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .
more support from europe the global economic crisis has in some respects overwhelmed what was already a daunting foreign policy agenda .
james steinberg , the former deputy national security advisor in the clinton administration , is heading the transition team assigned to shaping the foreign and security policies and assembling the team that will carry them out .
obama has declared his intention to set a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq within 16 months of taking office and will try to move even more quickly in order to reassign forces to the conflict in afghanistan , where the taliban and their al-qaeda allies have been ascendant . in addition , obama will call on the european allies to assume greater responsibility in helping shape policies to combat terrorism that will put new emphasis on economic reconstruction rather than brute military force - in other words , a more determined effort to win hearts and minds rather than kill suspected enemies .
he has also expressed a desire to show american leadership by embarking on new initiatives in three areas neglected by the bush administration : climate change , nuclear disarmament , and a ban on torture to show respect for international law like the geneva convention .
while those policy changes will no doubt be applauded in european capitals , the call for europe to do more during a phase of economic turmoil in helping the united states may not be greeted with enthusiasm .
the end of the unilateral bush era the obama administration will have no choice but to tackle several major challenges at once .
he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .
the heads of the other 26 allied governments will listen closely to obama 's speech for insights into his presidency , but his words are likely to be long on symbolism and short on substance since he will no doubt still be putting together his cabinet and foreign policy team . but he will surely show that america has turned the page on the bush presidency by declaring the era of unilateralism is over and that the united states will re-engage with the rest of the world , including direct talks with its enemies , by demonstrating an abiding commitment to diplomacy and the rule of international law .
dramatic difference opinion surveys show that this change is strongly supported by the american people , who have grown dismayed and disenchanted with the misbegotten military adventures of the neoconservative cabal that dominated bush 's foreign policy team .
in short , america and the world will probably wake up on the morning of nov .
5 to a dramatically different government taking over in the united states .
if obama can fulfill the hopes and ambitions of the millions of american voters yearning for change , he will go down in history books as a transformational leader who brought the united states back from the precipice of decline as a world power and restored its original sense of purpose as a stalwart defender of democratic values and human rights . william m. drozdiak has been the president of the american council on germany -lrb- acg -rrb- since february 2005 .
prior to that , he was the executive director of the transatlantic center of the german marshall fund of the united states .
in addition , he has worked as an editor and foreign correspondent for the washington post , time and the washington star , covering such historical events as the collapse of the soviet union , the first peace agreement between israel and egypt and the iran-iraq war .
drozdiak was a professional basketball player in the us and europe between 1971 and 1978 . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

google said it hoped to reach similar deals to benefit europe and asia . in the united states the google accord has been widely welcomed , since the bulk of books existing today are hard to obtain , as they are no longer on sale and uneconomic to reprint though their copyrights have not expired . at us public libraries , those books from recent decades will be visible in their entirety on library computers , while 20 per cent of those books will be visible to home users . for readers in the rest of the world , google will only be showing about two lines of text at a time . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government is planning to introduce a two-year , tax-free scheme for new environmentally-friendly cars .
but environmentalists have warned the plan will backfire because the criteria are not strict enough . " we want to introduce an automobile tax exemption for cars that are particularly clean , " environment minister sigmar gabriel told ard public television on thursday , oct .
30 .

" " this is a giant purchase incentive for climate killers , " it said . the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , juergen trittin , has attacked the move , saying the government was acting blindly .
he said cabinet members were organizing a sell-off of pollution-spewing gas guzzlers . " if people are to be encouraged to buy , then they have to promote the purchase of low-consumption cars - of vehicles that produce less than 120 gram of co2 per kilometer , " the former environment minister urged . the german newspaper rheinische post said the tax break would probably cost 2 billion euros in 2009 , citing government sources . older cars would not be eligible for the exemption , which gabriel said the cabinet planned to approve next wednesday and roll out on jan .

the german government is planning to introduce a two-year , tax-free scheme for new environmentally-friendly cars .
but environmentalists have warned the plan will backfire because the criteria are not strict enough . " we want to introduce an automobile tax exemption for cars that are particularly clean , " environment minister sigmar gabriel told ard public television on thursday , oct .
30 .
" that is the proposal that the finance minister will present .
but we still need the approval of the federal states . " automobile taxes are raised by germany 's 16 states and gabriel said finance minister peer steinbrueck would negotiate with the states about how to make up for the resulting tax shortfall . " we of course do not want the states to shoulder the burden on their own , " gabriel said . the tax breaks are likely to last one or two years depending on the car 's particular specifications . criteria not strict enough , say environmentalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentally , japan is still putting the german car industry to shame environmentalists attacked the proposal saying the criteria for the tax exemption were so lax they would include most new cars including gas guzzlers such as sport utility vehicles , which since 2005 have had to meet new emissions standards . " petrol-thirsty automobiles with big motors will benefit , " the ngo german environmental aid said in a statement , calling chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition as " car-driven . " " this is a giant purchase incentive for climate killers , " it said . the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , juergen trittin , has attacked the move , saying the government was acting blindly .
he said cabinet members were organizing a sell-off of pollution-spewing gas guzzlers . " if people are to be encouraged to buy , then they have to promote the purchase of low-consumption cars - of vehicles that produce less than 120 gram of co2 per kilometer , " the former environment minister urged . the german newspaper rheinische post said the tax break would probably cost 2 billion euros in 2009 , citing government sources . older cars would not be eligible for the exemption , which gabriel said the cabinet planned to approve next wednesday and roll out on jan .
1 . gabriel said berlin aimed to eventually introduce a sliding scale for car tax pegged to the amount of carbon emissions that they produce rather than the size of their engines .

5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page . with opinion polls showing barack obama expanding his lead over john mccain just days before the united states presidential election , attention is turning to what kind of policies obama will try to execute if and when he occupies the white house after inauguration day on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william drozdiak already , this presidential transition is shaping up as one of the most difficult in american history : the next president will inherit two wars in iraq and afghanistan , potential showdowns over nuclear threats from iran and north korea , a newly aggressive russia , and a financial crisis worse than anything since the great depression .
even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .
more support from europe the global economic crisis has in some respects overwhelmed what was already a daunting foreign policy agenda .
james steinberg , the former deputy national security advisor in the clinton administration , is heading the transition team assigned to shaping the foreign and security policies and assembling the team that will carry them out .
obama has declared his intention to set a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq within 16 months of taking office and will try to move even more quickly in order to reassign forces to the conflict in afghanistan , where the taliban and their al-qaeda allies have been ascendant . in addition , obama will call on the european allies to assume greater responsibility in helping shape policies to combat terrorism that will put new emphasis on economic reconstruction rather than brute military force - in other words , a more determined effort to win hearts and minds rather than kill suspected enemies .
he has also expressed a desire to show american leadership by embarking on new initiatives in three areas neglected by the bush administration : climate change , nuclear disarmament , and a ban on torture to show respect for international law like the geneva convention .
while those policy changes will no doubt be applauded in european capitals , the call for europe to do more during a phase of economic turmoil in helping the united states may not be greeted with enthusiasm .
the end of the unilateral bush era the obama administration will have no choice but to tackle several major challenges at once .
he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .
the heads of the other 26 allied governments will listen closely to obama 's speech for insights into his presidency , but his words are likely to be long on symbolism and short on substance since he will no doubt still be putting together his cabinet and foreign policy team . but he will surely show that america has turned the page on the bush presidency by declaring the era of unilateralism is over and that the united states will re-engage with the rest of the world , including direct talks with its enemies , by demonstrating an abiding commitment to diplomacy and the rule of international law .
dramatic difference opinion surveys show that this change is strongly supported by the american people , who have grown dismayed and disenchanted with the misbegotten military adventures of the neoconservative cabal that dominated bush 's foreign policy team .
in short , america and the world will probably wake up on the morning of nov .
5 to a dramatically different government taking over in the united states .
if obama can fulfill the hopes and ambitions of the millions of american voters yearning for change , he will go down in history books as a transformational leader who brought the united states back from the precipice of decline as a world power and restored its original sense of purpose as a stalwart defender of democratic values and human rights . william m. drozdiak has been the president of the american council on germany -lrb- acg -rrb- since february 2005 .
prior to that , he was the executive director of the transatlantic center of the german marshall fund of the united states .
in addition , he has worked as an editor and foreign correspondent for the washington post , time and the washington star , covering such historical events as the collapse of the soviet union , the first peace agreement between israel and egypt and the iran-iraq war .

5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page . with opinion polls showing barack obama expanding his lead over john mccain just days before the united states presidential election , attention is turning to what kind of policies obama will try to execute if and when he occupies the white house after inauguration day on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william drozdiak already , this presidential transition is shaping up as one of the most difficult in american history : the next president will inherit two wars in iraq and afghanistan , potential showdowns over nuclear threats from iran and north korea , a newly aggressive russia , and a financial crisis worse than anything since the great depression .
even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .

the german government is planning to introduce a two-year , tax-free scheme for new environmentally-friendly cars .
but environmentalists have warned the plan will backfire because the criteria are not strict enough . " we want to introduce an automobile tax exemption for cars that are particularly clean , " environment minister sigmar gabriel told ard public television on thursday , oct .
30 .
" that is the proposal that the finance minister will present .
but we still need the approval of the federal states . " automobile taxes are raised by germany 's 16 states and gabriel said finance minister peer steinbrueck would negotiate with the states about how to make up for the resulting tax shortfall . " we of course do not want the states to shoulder the burden on their own , " gabriel said . the tax breaks are likely to last one or two years depending on the car 's particular specifications . criteria not strict enough , say environmentalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentally , japan is still putting the german car industry to shame environmentalists attacked the proposal saying the criteria for the tax exemption were so lax they would include most new cars including gas guzzlers such as sport utility vehicles , which since 2005 have had to meet new emissions standards . " petrol-thirsty automobiles with big motors will benefit , " the ngo german environmental aid said in a statement , calling chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition as " car-driven . " " this is a giant purchase incentive for climate killers , " it said . the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , juergen trittin , has attacked the move , saying the government was acting blindly .
he said cabinet members were organizing a sell-off of pollution-spewing gas guzzlers . " if people are to be encouraged to buy , then they have to promote the purchase of low-consumption cars - of vehicles that produce less than 120 gram of co2 per kilometer , " the former environment minister urged . the german newspaper rheinische post said the tax break would probably cost 2 billion euros in 2009 , citing government sources . older cars would not be eligible for the exemption , which gabriel said the cabinet planned to approve next wednesday and roll out on jan .
1 . gabriel said berlin aimed to eventually introduce a sliding scale for car tax pegged to the amount of carbon emissions that they produce rather than the size of their engines .
co2 emissions are blamed for driving global warming . german carmakers welcome the plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups say the proposal is nothing but a support for carmakers the car industry in both europe and the united states has been appealing to governments to act to revive sales in the financial-crisis struck sector .
the vda , the german automobile industry 's biggest interest group , welcomed the plan . " the tax holiday proposed today for new cars can provide an impetus to spur sales of vehicles , stabilize the economy and thus ensure jobs in germany , " vda president matthias wissmann said in a statement .
he also added that the industry would welcome a tax based on the level of co2 emissions . with credit scarce and sales plunging , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen threw his weight on wednesday behind a call to give the bloc 's carmakers cheap loans worth up to 40 billion euros to invest in the development of eco-friendly cars during the financial crisis . the car industry is a key pillar of europe 's biggest economy , home to giants including volkswagen , bmw and porsche .
up to now , the sector has been rather resistant to moving away from its traditional niche market of large , luxury cars with big engines . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 30.10.2008 eu lawmakers demand hooker-free lodging großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the letter has drawn attention to a little-known issue a group of scandinavian european parliamentarians has called for the eu parliament in strasbourg to stop using hotels where prostitutes are allowed . the european parliament convenes most often in brussels , but once a month it meets in its official seat in strasbourg , france . each time the approximately 800 lawmakers and their staff arrive , the town on the french-german borders sees a boom in prostitution , the german daily news web site tagesschau asserts . now , a letter signed by 37 parliamentarians - mainly from scandinavian countries - is calling for the body to " only use hotels which issue a guarantee that the hotel is not involved in sex trade , and that all staff have written guidelines on this issue . " change of mentality " it 's a serious issue , " parliamentary spokesman jaume duch fridau told the afp news service earlier in the week .
fridau added that the letter had been passed on to parliament president hans-gert poettering . if the eu agrees to the demands of the letter , it would be aligning itself with a 2006 decision by the nordic council , which is made up of denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden .
the european deputies said such a decision could help tackle the problems of prostitution , organized crime , and human trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : streetwalkers are often victims of human trafficking " it requires a change of mentality " to end the situation where you have " hotels as providers of sex trade with humans , as if they were dealing with an ordinary commodity , " the letter claimed . organized crime was involved in " the increase in human trafficking where , for example , young women from poor countries are sold to a life as sex slaves in the prostitution industry , " the letter continued . union of values one of the letter 's signatories , swedish mep helene goudin , said it was also necessary to ban elected meps and their staff from using hotels that air pornographic films in their bedrooms . " we are against the exploitation of women in general , " she told afp .
" the european union is a union of values and we thing we should reach agreement on this subject . " the letter was not raising the question of whether or not prostitution should be made legal , according to its instigator , danish parliamentarian karin riis joergensen . " it is simply about the fact that during the strasburg parliamentary weeks , we do n't want to go into hotels where there are prostitutes , " she told tagesschau.de .
lawmakers who want to set up parties with prostitutes should go elsewhere , she said .
" but not in the same hotels with us .
we just want clean hotels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovely strasbourg , surrounded by a shady ring road the reaction to the demands has been low-key so far .
bavarian eu lawmaker manfred ferber told tagesschau he was " surprised , at first , that there was such a letter . " lawmakers worry about reputation " i 've been in the same hotel for more than 11 years and have n't noticed anything up to now , " he said . ferber is one of many parliamentarians who worry that the uproar wo n't do so much to fight prostitution as it will to blemish the reputation of eu lawmakers in the eyes of their constituents . but the fact remains that the small french city is a center for the illegal sex trade , according to tagesschau .
the site reports that a ring road that surrounds the old town is one long red-light district , populated mostly by eastern european prostitutes - many of whom are there unwillingly . meanwhile , europeans are anything but unified on how to deal with prostitution .
does it make more sense to outlaw it , like denmark does ?

5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page . with opinion polls showing barack obama expanding his lead over john mccain just days before the united states presidential election , attention is turning to what kind of policies obama will try to execute if and when he occupies the white house after inauguration day on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william drozdiak already , this presidential transition is shaping up as one of the most difficult in american history : the next president will inherit two wars in iraq and afghanistan , potential showdowns over nuclear threats from iran and north korea , a newly aggressive russia , and a financial crisis worse than anything since the great depression .
even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .
more support from europe the global economic crisis has in some respects overwhelmed what was already a daunting foreign policy agenda .
james steinberg , the former deputy national security advisor in the clinton administration , is heading the transition team assigned to shaping the foreign and security policies and assembling the team that will carry them out .
obama has declared his intention to set a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq within 16 months of taking office and will try to move even more quickly in order to reassign forces to the conflict in afghanistan , where the taliban and their al-qaeda allies have been ascendant . in addition , obama will call on the european allies to assume greater responsibility in helping shape policies to combat terrorism that will put new emphasis on economic reconstruction rather than brute military force - in other words , a more determined effort to win hearts and minds rather than kill suspected enemies .
he has also expressed a desire to show american leadership by embarking on new initiatives in three areas neglected by the bush administration : climate change , nuclear disarmament , and a ban on torture to show respect for international law like the geneva convention .
while those policy changes will no doubt be applauded in european capitals , the call for europe to do more during a phase of economic turmoil in helping the united states may not be greeted with enthusiasm .
the end of the unilateral bush era the obama administration will have no choice but to tackle several major challenges at once .
he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .
the heads of the other 26 allied governments will listen closely to obama 's speech for insights into his presidency , but his words are likely to be long on symbolism and short on substance since he will no doubt still be putting together his cabinet and foreign policy team . but he will surely show that america has turned the page on the bush presidency by declaring the era of unilateralism is over and that the united states will re-engage with the rest of the world , including direct talks with its enemies , by demonstrating an abiding commitment to diplomacy and the rule of international law .
dramatic difference opinion surveys show that this change is strongly supported by the american people , who have grown dismayed and disenchanted with the misbegotten military adventures of the neoconservative cabal that dominated bush 's foreign policy team .
in short , america and the world will probably wake up on the morning of nov .
5 to a dramatically different government taking over in the united states .
if obama can fulfill the hopes and ambitions of the millions of american voters yearning for change , he will go down in history books as a transformational leader who brought the united states back from the precipice of decline as a world power and restored its original sense of purpose as a stalwart defender of democratic values and human rights . william m. drozdiak has been the president of the american council on germany -lrb- acg -rrb- since february 2005 .
prior to that , he was the executive director of the transatlantic center of the german marshall fund of the united states .
in addition , he has worked as an editor and foreign correspondent for the washington post , time and the washington star , covering such historical events as the collapse of the soviet union , the first peace agreement between israel and egypt and the iran-iraq war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 30.10.2008 eu lawmakers demand hooker-free lodging großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the letter has drawn attention to a little-known issue a group of scandinavian european parliamentarians has called for the eu parliament in strasbourg to stop using hotels where prostitutes are allowed . the european parliament convenes most often in brussels , but once a month it meets in its official seat in strasbourg , france . each time the approximately 800 lawmakers and their staff arrive , the town on the french-german borders sees a boom in prostitution , the german daily news web site tagesschau asserts . now , a letter signed by 37 parliamentarians - mainly from scandinavian countries - is calling for the body to " only use hotels which issue a guarantee that the hotel is not involved in sex trade , and that all staff have written guidelines on this issue . " change of mentality " it 's a serious issue , " parliamentary spokesman jaume duch fridau told the afp news service earlier in the week .
fridau added that the letter had been passed on to parliament president hans-gert poettering . if the eu agrees to the demands of the letter , it would be aligning itself with a 2006 decision by the nordic council , which is made up of denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden .
the european deputies said such a decision could help tackle the problems of prostitution , organized crime , and human trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : streetwalkers are often victims of human trafficking " it requires a change of mentality " to end the situation where you have " hotels as providers of sex trade with humans , as if they were dealing with an ordinary commodity , " the letter claimed . organized crime was involved in " the increase in human trafficking where , for example , young women from poor countries are sold to a life as sex slaves in the prostitution industry , " the letter continued . union of values one of the letter 's signatories , swedish mep helene goudin , said it was also necessary to ban elected meps and their staff from using hotels that air pornographic films in their bedrooms . " we are against the exploitation of women in general , " she told afp .
" the european union is a union of values and we thing we should reach agreement on this subject . " the letter was not raising the question of whether or not prostitution should be made legal , according to its instigator , danish parliamentarian karin riis joergensen . " it is simply about the fact that during the strasburg parliamentary weeks , we do n't want to go into hotels where there are prostitutes , " she told tagesschau.de .
lawmakers who want to set up parties with prostitutes should go elsewhere , she said .
" but not in the same hotels with us .
we just want clean hotels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovely strasbourg , surrounded by a shady ring road the reaction to the demands has been low-key so far .
bavarian eu lawmaker manfred ferber told tagesschau he was " surprised , at first , that there was such a letter . " lawmakers worry about reputation " i 've been in the same hotel for more than 11 years and have n't noticed anything up to now , " he said . ferber is one of many parliamentarians who worry that the uproar wo n't do so much to fight prostitution as it will to blemish the reputation of eu lawmakers in the eyes of their constituents . but the fact remains that the small french city is a center for the illegal sex trade , according to tagesschau .
the site reports that a ring road that surrounds the old town is one long red-light district , populated mostly by eastern european prostitutes - many of whom are there unwillingly . meanwhile , europeans are anything but unified on how to deal with prostitution .
does it make more sense to outlaw it , like denmark does ?
to limit it , like they do in france ?
or do the germans , who have legalized the trade , have the right idea ?
each eu state has its own laws on the books - making it all the more difficult to fight against human trafficking . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" change of mentality " it 's a serious issue , " parliamentary spokesman jaume duch fridau told the afp news service earlier in the week .
fridau added that the letter had been passed on to parliament president hans-gert poettering . if the eu agrees to the demands of the letter , it would be aligning itself with a 2006 decision by the nordic council , which is made up of denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden .
the european deputies said such a decision could help tackle the problems of prostitution , organized crime , and human trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : streetwalkers are often victims of human trafficking " it requires a change of mentality " to end the situation where you have " hotels as providers of sex trade with humans , as if they were dealing with an ordinary commodity , " the letter claimed . organized crime was involved in " the increase in human trafficking where , for example , young women from poor countries are sold to a life as sex slaves in the prostitution industry , " the letter continued . union of values one of the letter 's signatories , swedish mep helene goudin , said it was also necessary to ban elected meps and their staff from using hotels that air pornographic films in their bedrooms . " we are against the exploitation of women in general , " she told afp .
" the european union is a union of values and we thing we should reach agreement on this subject . " the letter was not raising the question of whether or not prostitution should be made legal , according to its instigator , danish parliamentarian karin riis joergensen . " it is simply about the fact that during the strasburg parliamentary weeks , we do n't want to go into hotels where there are prostitutes , " she told tagesschau.de .
lawmakers who want to set up parties with prostitutes should go elsewhere , she said .
" but not in the same hotels with us .
we just want clean hotels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovely strasbourg , surrounded by a shady ring road the reaction to the demands has been low-key so far .
bavarian eu lawmaker manfred ferber told tagesschau he was " surprised , at first , that there was such a letter . " lawmakers worry about reputation " i 've been in the same hotel for more than 11 years and have n't noticed anything up to now , " he said . ferber is one of many parliamentarians who worry that the uproar wo n't do so much to fight prostitution as it will to blemish the reputation of eu lawmakers in the eyes of their constituents . but the fact remains that the small french city is a center for the illegal sex trade , according to tagesschau .
the site reports that a ring road that surrounds the old town is one long red-light district , populated mostly by eastern european prostitutes - many of whom are there unwillingly . meanwhile , europeans are anything but unified on how to deal with prostitution .
does it make more sense to outlaw it , like denmark does ?
to limit it , like they do in france ?
or do the germans , who have legalized the trade , have the right idea ?
each eu state has its own laws on the books - making it all the more difficult to fight against human trafficking . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mandela went on to become the country 's first democratic president in 1994 .
" at the beginning of the 1990s , i had prepared a project in soweto , " wallraff said in a speech to a full house at the goethe institute in johannesburg on wednesday , oct .
29 .
south african writer breyten breytenbach , who himself had spent years in south african prison for his own activities against the apartheid government , had helped him plan the project , according to wallraff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandela 's release from jail shelved wallraff 's project he went on to describe how he always tested his disguises on his own daughters before reading excerpts from his next book about the " new " working world and from his autobiography .
" everything is in question " guenter wallraff , whose 1985 book " lowest of the low " documented the work and living conditions of turkish guest workers in germany , also warned his audience of the worsening work conditions in german companies .
" fear is spreading in the factories , no one dares to speak up .
we live in a time where everything is in question , " wallraff said .
wallraff said the global finance crisis in the markets signaled not only an economic crisis but also a crisis through the whole system , and said he hoped it would provide the basis for a new " age of moderation and values . "
wallraff also announced he was setting up a foundation named after himself to help young journalists uncover injustices in the workplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks against foreigners outside johannesburg in may are worth further investigation , said wallraff asked what he would do as a south african investigative journalist , wallraff said : " i would probably live in alexandra , where the anti-foreigner pogroms took place . "
he was referring to the township outside johannesburg where south africans killed at least 60 refugees as the situation worsened in neighboring zimbabwe .
many of the victims were zimbabweans .
wallraff said he would like to find out what led the poorest of the poor in alexandra to such excesses . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , the roman catholic archbishop who is the most outspoken of germany 's 27 diocesan leaders in his criticism of big business , says that his work is to some extent " an argument with marxism . " the book begins as a letter addressed to his " dear namesake . " " the consequences , " he tells the 19th-century ideologist , " of your thinking were disastrous . " social teaching in a globalized world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx is unrelated to the communist ideologue the modern-day marx demands that the whole world adopt a market economy that is kinder to the weak and downtrodden instead of " heaping even more rewards on those who behave immorally . " " that 's not utopia .
it 's a necessity for the sake of humans , " said marx in munich . the 300-page book , " das kapital : a plea for man " , deliberately borrows its title from the " bible " of communism in which karl marx claimed 140 years ago that capitalism would automatically collapse . with this new book , however , marx intends to highlight the value of catholic social teaching in a globalized world . " capitalism without humanity , solidarity and justice has no morals and no future , " marx writes . he said we need to take a fresh look at social justice , or the world might veer back to dangerous ideologies such as marxism . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , to retain the bundesliga lead in the midweek round . demba ba , vedad ibisevic -lrb- penalty -rrb- and carlos eduardo scored within six minutes to reverse bochum 's early lead from dennis grote .
bochum 's agony was complete when christoph dabrowski was sent off . newly-promoted hoffenheim top the bill with 22 points from bayer leverkusen -lrb- 21 -rrb- , with sv hamburg third on 20 from a 2-0 victory against vfb stuttgart .
champions bayern munich rose to fourth place with 18 points from their third straight win , a 2-1 comeback effort at eintracht frankfurt from miroslav klose and franck ribery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim scored all three goals within six minutes hoffenheim remained the toast of the league even though they were shocked just two minutes into the game in bochum when grote fired a low shot into the net from the edge of the area .
it took hoffenheim until the 65th minute to level , from a neat back-heeler by ba , and the visitors then went on the roll yet again to claim their fourth straight victory .
league top scorer ibisevic raised his tally to 11 with a 70th-minute penalty after grote had brought down andreas beck .
eduardo wrapped up matters just 60 seconds later and bochum 's frustration showed when dabrowski had to leave for a second bookable offence in the 76th .
" it took us a while to get into the game .
but we have played quite well so far in the season and aim to keep going , " said beck .
munich pulls ahead for win munich also had to come from behind to beat frankfurt , who were coming off their first two season wins and took a 55th-minute lead against the flow of play from an own goal by martin demichelis .
but ribery fed klose for the equalizer in the 63rd and the frenchman got the winning volley in the 70th to sooth the nerves of coach juergen klinsmann .
" it was important to show a strong reaction after the own goal .
we showed that we are a team which can attack , " said munich midfielder tim borowski .
former leaders hamburg , meanwhile , recovered well from sunday 's 3-0 loss in hoffenheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery -lrb- right -rrb- helped munich to their third straight win germany midfielder poitr triochowski opened the scoring with a 17th-minute penalty , guy demel was denied by the bar late in the first half but a deflected shot from joris mathijsen clinched hamburg 's win in the 74th .
" it was n't our best game but the main thing is that we won , " said hamburg sports director dietmar beiersdorfer .

5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page . with opinion polls showing barack obama expanding his lead over john mccain just days before the united states presidential election , attention is turning to what kind of policies obama will try to execute if and when he occupies the white house after inauguration day on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william drozdiak already , this presidential transition is shaping up as one of the most difficult in american history : the next president will inherit two wars in iraq and afghanistan , potential showdowns over nuclear threats from iran and north korea , a newly aggressive russia , and a financial crisis worse than anything since the great depression .
even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .
more support from europe the global economic crisis has in some respects overwhelmed what was already a daunting foreign policy agenda .
james steinberg , the former deputy national security advisor in the clinton administration , is heading the transition team assigned to shaping the foreign and security policies and assembling the team that will carry them out .
obama has declared his intention to set a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq within 16 months of taking office and will try to move even more quickly in order to reassign forces to the conflict in afghanistan , where the taliban and their al-qaeda allies have been ascendant . in addition , obama will call on the european allies to assume greater responsibility in helping shape policies to combat terrorism that will put new emphasis on economic reconstruction rather than brute military force - in other words , a more determined effort to win hearts and minds rather than kill suspected enemies .
he has also expressed a desire to show american leadership by embarking on new initiatives in three areas neglected by the bush administration : climate change , nuclear disarmament , and a ban on torture to show respect for international law like the geneva convention .
while those policy changes will no doubt be applauded in european capitals , the call for europe to do more during a phase of economic turmoil in helping the united states may not be greeted with enthusiasm .
the end of the unilateral bush era the obama administration will have no choice but to tackle several major challenges at once .
he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .
the heads of the other 26 allied governments will listen closely to obama 's speech for insights into his presidency , but his words are likely to be long on symbolism and short on substance since he will no doubt still be putting together his cabinet and foreign policy team . but he will surely show that america has turned the page on the bush presidency by declaring the era of unilateralism is over and that the united states will re-engage with the rest of the world , including direct talks with its enemies , by demonstrating an abiding commitment to diplomacy and the rule of international law .
dramatic difference opinion surveys show that this change is strongly supported by the american people , who have grown dismayed and disenchanted with the misbegotten military adventures of the neoconservative cabal that dominated bush 's foreign policy team .
in short , america and the world will probably wake up on the morning of nov .
5 to a dramatically different government taking over in the united states .
if obama can fulfill the hopes and ambitions of the millions of american voters yearning for change , he will go down in history books as a transformational leader who brought the united states back from the precipice of decline as a world power and restored its original sense of purpose as a stalwart defender of democratic values and human rights . william m. drozdiak has been the president of the american council on germany -lrb- acg -rrb- since february 2005 .
prior to that , he was the executive director of the transatlantic center of the german marshall fund of the united states .
in addition , he has worked as an editor and foreign correspondent for the washington post , time and the washington star , covering such historical events as the collapse of the soviet union , the first peace agreement between israel and egypt and the iran-iraq war .

5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page . with opinion polls showing barack obama expanding his lead over john mccain just days before the united states presidential election , attention is turning to what kind of policies obama will try to execute if and when he occupies the white house after inauguration day on jan .
20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william drozdiak already , this presidential transition is shaping up as one of the most difficult in american history : the next president will inherit two wars in iraq and afghanistan , potential showdowns over nuclear threats from iran and north korea , a newly aggressive russia , and a financial crisis worse than anything since the great depression .
even though he has many experts on his team who are studying the problems , the fact that the next president will have barely ten weeks to assemble his cabinet and prepare his policy agenda before taking office illustrate the difficult challenge he faces .
many pundits ask indeed why anybody would want a job so fraught with peril .
an advised transition obama has approached this staggering task with cool methodology . he has appointed two experienced advisors to head the executive transition teams that will put together his new government .
john podesta , former white house chief of staff under president bill clinton , is handling domestic issues including top policy priorities like climate change and energy security , the financial crisis and job creation , and an overhaul of tax and education programs . given the dramatic risks of a global downturn and the evident need to reform the world financial system , obama has emphasized the themes of economic reform in the last phase of the campaign in an effort to distinguish his proposals from those of his republic opponent . aides say he speaks several times a day with key advisors like former federal reserve chairman paul volcker and former treasury secretary robert rubin in order to refine his message given the twists and turns of volatile world markets .
more support from europe the global economic crisis has in some respects overwhelmed what was already a daunting foreign policy agenda .
james steinberg , the former deputy national security advisor in the clinton administration , is heading the transition team assigned to shaping the foreign and security policies and assembling the team that will carry them out .
obama has declared his intention to set a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq within 16 months of taking office and will try to move even more quickly in order to reassign forces to the conflict in afghanistan , where the taliban and their al-qaeda allies have been ascendant . in addition , obama will call on the european allies to assume greater responsibility in helping shape policies to combat terrorism that will put new emphasis on economic reconstruction rather than brute military force - in other words , a more determined effort to win hearts and minds rather than kill suspected enemies .
he has also expressed a desire to show american leadership by embarking on new initiatives in three areas neglected by the bush administration : climate change , nuclear disarmament , and a ban on torture to show respect for international law like the geneva convention .
while those policy changes will no doubt be applauded in european capitals , the call for europe to do more during a phase of economic turmoil in helping the united states may not be greeted with enthusiasm .
the end of the unilateral bush era the obama administration will have no choice but to tackle several major challenges at once .
he will push for a major new stimulus package to put money back in the pockets of american consumers and will launch a massive new infrastructure fund to help repair dilapidated roads and bridges that will also have the healthy effect of creating new jobs .
the next congress , likely to be dominated by democrats , will want to impose new regulations on derivatives and other " weapons of financial destruction " that are widely blamed for causing the global credit crisis .
after seeing republicans tear down regulatory controls in a fit of free market fanaticism , the democrats want to restore laws that curtailed the role of banks and investment houses .
in addition , obama will look at how institutions like the world bank and international monetary fund can be modernized and adapted to a world vastly different from the post world war two era when they were created .
the group of eight industrial powers will likely be doubled in size to include brazil , china , india and other emerging economies .
like the united nations , these organizations have suffered a loss in public esteem because they no longer correspond to the realities of our time and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the world .
on the foreign policy front , obama 's first major trip abroad will probably occur in early april 2009 to baden-baden , germany for the 60th anniversary summit gathering of nato leaders .
the heads of the other 26 allied governments will listen closely to obama 's speech for insights into his presidency , but his words are likely to be long on symbolism and short on substance since he will no doubt still be putting together his cabinet and foreign policy team . but he will surely show that america has turned the page on the bush presidency by declaring the era of unilateralism is over and that the united states will re-engage with the rest of the world , including direct talks with its enemies , by demonstrating an abiding commitment to diplomacy and the rule of international law .
dramatic difference opinion surveys show that this change is strongly supported by the american people , who have grown dismayed and disenchanted with the misbegotten military adventures of the neoconservative cabal that dominated bush 's foreign policy team .
in short , america and the world will probably wake up on the morning of nov .
5 to a dramatically different government taking over in the united states .
if obama can fulfill the hopes and ambitions of the millions of american voters yearning for change , he will go down in history books as a transformational leader who brought the united states back from the precipice of decline as a world power and restored its original sense of purpose as a stalwart defender of democratic values and human rights . william m. drozdiak has been the president of the american council on germany -lrb- acg -rrb- since february 2005 .
prior to that , he was the executive director of the transatlantic center of the german marshall fund of the united states .
in addition , he has worked as an editor and foreign correspondent for the washington post , time and the washington star , covering such historical events as the collapse of the soviet union , the first peace agreement between israel and egypt and the iran-iraq war .

the government plans to pump some 25 billion euros into rescuing the economy . seasonally adjusted unemployment data to be released on thursday , oct .
30 , is expected to show the numbers of out-of-work germans slipped by another 10,000 this month , leaving unemployment at 7.6 percent .
unemployment already fell 29,000 in september .
but economists see dark clouds on the horizon .
they believe the labor market has yet to factor in the global economic downturn , and that it still reflects the strong economic growth rate from the start of the year .
growth package planned in a bid to boost the nation 's economy , the coalition government plans to pump between up to 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 33 billion -rrb- into the economy , largely in infrastructure projects , according to the head of the german social democratic party 's parliamentary group , peter struck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck : financing infrastructure will pay off the german cabinet will vote on the growth package on wednesday , nov .
5 .
speaking to the berliner zeitung , struck said funding is certain for building restoration funds by 2015 , traffic projects , and a limited-time reintroduction of depreciation possibilities for companies .
the ministry of labor also suggested means for securing jobs .
the plans mean taking on more debt , struck told the berliner zeitung .

he was referring to the township outside johannesburg where south africans killed at least 60 refugees as the situation worsened in neighboring zimbabwe .
many of the victims were zimbabweans .

mandela went on to become the country 's first democratic president in 1994 .
" at the beginning of the 1990s , i had prepared a project in soweto , " wallraff said in a speech to a full house at the goethe institute in johannesburg on wednesday , oct .

south african writer breyten breytenbach , who himself had spent years in south african prison for his own activities against the apartheid government , had helped him plan the project , according to wallraff .

wallraff also announced he was setting up a foundation named after himself to help young journalists uncover injustices in the workplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks against foreigners outside johannesburg in may are worth further investigation , said wallraff asked what he would do as a south african investigative journalist , wallraff said : " i would probably live in alexandra , where the anti-foreigner pogroms took place . "
he was referring to the township outside johannesburg where south africans killed at least 60 refugees as the situation worsened in neighboring zimbabwe .
many of the victims were zimbabweans .
wallraff said he would like to find out what led the poorest of the poor in alexandra to such excesses . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" change of mentality " it 's a serious issue , " parliamentary spokesman jaume duch fridau told the afp news service earlier in the week .
fridau added that the letter had been passed on to parliament president hans-gert poettering . if the eu agrees to the demands of the letter , it would be aligning itself with a 2006 decision by the nordic council , which is made up of denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden .
the european deputies said such a decision could help tackle the problems of prostitution , organized crime , and human trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : streetwalkers are often victims of human trafficking " it requires a change of mentality " to end the situation where you have " hotels as providers of sex trade with humans , as if they were dealing with an ordinary commodity , " the letter claimed . organized crime was involved in " the increase in human trafficking where , for example , young women from poor countries are sold to a life as sex slaves in the prostitution industry , " the letter continued . union of values one of the letter 's signatories , swedish mep helene goudin , said it was also necessary to ban elected meps and their staff from using hotels that air pornographic films in their bedrooms . " we are against the exploitation of women in general , " she told afp .
" the european union is a union of values and we thing we should reach agreement on this subject . " the letter was not raising the question of whether or not prostitution should be made legal , according to its instigator , danish parliamentarian karin riis joergensen . " it is simply about the fact that during the strasburg parliamentary weeks , we do n't want to go into hotels where there are prostitutes , " she told tagesschau.de .
lawmakers who want to set up parties with prostitutes should go elsewhere , she said .
" but not in the same hotels with us .
we just want clean hotels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovely strasbourg , surrounded by a shady ring road the reaction to the demands has been low-key so far .
bavarian eu lawmaker manfred ferber told tagesschau he was " surprised , at first , that there was such a letter . " lawmakers worry about reputation " i 've been in the same hotel for more than 11 years and have n't noticed anything up to now , " he said . ferber is one of many parliamentarians who worry that the uproar wo n't do so much to fight prostitution as it will to blemish the reputation of eu lawmakers in the eyes of their constituents . but the fact remains that the small french city is a center for the illegal sex trade , according to tagesschau .
the site reports that a ring road that surrounds the old town is one long red-light district , populated mostly by eastern european prostitutes - many of whom are there unwillingly . meanwhile , europeans are anything but unified on how to deal with prostitution .
does it make more sense to outlaw it , like denmark does ?
to limit it , like they do in france ?
or do the germans , who have legalized the trade , have the right idea ?
each eu state has its own laws on the books - making it all the more difficult to fight against human trafficking . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mandela went on to become the country 's first democratic president in 1994 .
" at the beginning of the 1990s , i had prepared a project in soweto , " wallraff said in a speech to a full house at the goethe institute in johannesburg on wednesday , oct .

wallraff also announced he was setting up a foundation named after himself to help young journalists uncover injustices in the workplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks against foreigners outside johannesburg in may are worth further investigation , said wallraff asked what he would do as a south african investigative journalist , wallraff said : " i would probably live in alexandra , where the anti-foreigner pogroms took place . "
he was referring to the township outside johannesburg where south africans killed at least 60 refugees as the situation worsened in neighboring zimbabwe .
many of the victims were zimbabweans .

instead , the roman catholic archbishop who is the most outspoken of germany 's 27 diocesan leaders in his criticism of big business , says that his work is to some extent " an argument with marxism . " the book begins as a letter addressed to his " dear namesake . " " the consequences , " he tells the 19th-century ideologist , " of your thinking were disastrous . " social teaching in a globalized world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx is unrelated to the communist ideologue the modern-day marx demands that the whole world adopt a market economy that is kinder to the weak and downtrodden instead of " heaping even more rewards on those who behave immorally . " " that 's not utopia .
it 's a necessity for the sake of humans , " said marx in munich . the 300-page book , " das kapital : a plea for man " , deliberately borrows its title from the " bible " of communism in which karl marx claimed 140 years ago that capitalism would automatically collapse . with this new book , however , marx intends to highlight the value of catholic social teaching in a globalized world . " capitalism without humanity , solidarity and justice has no morals and no future , " marx writes . he said we need to take a fresh look at social justice , or the world might veer back to dangerous ideologies such as marxism . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german book publishers denounced a historic accord between google and us authors , dubbing it trick that would make the us company the master of the world 's knowledge . the boersenverein , the german booksellers and publishers association which has bitterly opposed google for years , rejected the accord as a " creeping takeover . " " this accord is like a trojan horse , " alexander skipis , chief executive of the boersenverein , said in a statement on thursday , oct .

" google aims to achieve worldwide control of knowledge and culture . " in the name of cultural diversity , this american model is out of the question for europe , " he said , adding that it contradicted " the european ideal of diversity through competition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has already digitized some 7 million books the boersenverein has funded a pay-for-use book-scanning service for german-language books , libreka . google , which has scanned 7 million books to include their contents in its internet search engine , announced tuesday it would let us users read the pages of books that are out of print but are still in copyright . under the settlement with the us authors guild and the association of american publishers , royalties will be paid for past and future use of the books by google . millions of the books are outdated and their authors dead , so a google-funded book registry will be set up to discover who now owns the copyrights .
google said it hoped to reach similar deals to benefit europe and asia . in the united states the google accord has been widely welcomed , since the bulk of books existing today are hard to obtain , as they are no longer on sale and uneconomic to reprint though their copyrights have not expired . at us public libraries , those books from recent decades will be visible in their entirety on library computers , while 20 per cent of those books will be visible to home users . for readers in the rest of the world , google will only be showing about two lines of text at a time . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , the roman catholic archbishop who is the most outspoken of germany 's 27 diocesan leaders in his criticism of big business , says that his work is to some extent " an argument with marxism . " the book begins as a letter addressed to his " dear namesake . " " the consequences , " he tells the 19th-century ideologist , " of your thinking were disastrous . " social teaching in a globalized world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx is unrelated to the communist ideologue the modern-day marx demands that the whole world adopt a market economy that is kinder to the weak and downtrodden instead of " heaping even more rewards on those who behave immorally . " " that 's not utopia .
it 's a necessity for the sake of humans , " said marx in munich . the 300-page book , " das kapital : a plea for man " , deliberately borrows its title from the " bible " of communism in which karl marx claimed 140 years ago that capitalism would automatically collapse . with this new book , however , marx intends to highlight the value of catholic social teaching in a globalized world . " capitalism without humanity , solidarity and justice has no morals and no future , " marx writes . he said we need to take a fresh look at social justice , or the world might veer back to dangerous ideologies such as marxism . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" change of mentality " it 's a serious issue , " parliamentary spokesman jaume duch fridau told the afp news service earlier in the week .
fridau added that the letter had been passed on to parliament president hans-gert poettering . if the eu agrees to the demands of the letter , it would be aligning itself with a 2006 decision by the nordic council , which is made up of denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden .
the european deputies said such a decision could help tackle the problems of prostitution , organized crime , and human trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : streetwalkers are often victims of human trafficking " it requires a change of mentality " to end the situation where you have " hotels as providers of sex trade with humans , as if they were dealing with an ordinary commodity , " the letter claimed . organized crime was involved in " the increase in human trafficking where , for example , young women from poor countries are sold to a life as sex slaves in the prostitution industry , " the letter continued . union of values one of the letter 's signatories , swedish mep helene goudin , said it was also necessary to ban elected meps and their staff from using hotels that air pornographic films in their bedrooms . " we are against the exploitation of women in general , " she told afp .
" the european union is a union of values and we thing we should reach agreement on this subject . " the letter was not raising the question of whether or not prostitution should be made legal , according to its instigator , danish parliamentarian karin riis joergensen . " it is simply about the fact that during the strasburg parliamentary weeks , we do n't want to go into hotels where there are prostitutes , " she told tagesschau.de .
lawmakers who want to set up parties with prostitutes should go elsewhere , she said .
" but not in the same hotels with us .
we just want clean hotels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovely strasbourg , surrounded by a shady ring road the reaction to the demands has been low-key so far .
bavarian eu lawmaker manfred ferber told tagesschau he was " surprised , at first , that there was such a letter . " lawmakers worry about reputation " i 've been in the same hotel for more than 11 years and have n't noticed anything up to now , " he said . ferber is one of many parliamentarians who worry that the uproar wo n't do so much to fight prostitution as it will to blemish the reputation of eu lawmakers in the eyes of their constituents . but the fact remains that the small french city is a center for the illegal sex trade , according to tagesschau .
the site reports that a ring road that surrounds the old town is one long red-light district , populated mostly by eastern european prostitutes - many of whom are there unwillingly . meanwhile , europeans are anything but unified on how to deal with prostitution .
does it make more sense to outlaw it , like denmark does ?
to limit it , like they do in france ?

german book publishers denounced a historic accord between google and us authors , dubbing it trick that would make the us company the master of the world 's knowledge . the boersenverein , the german booksellers and publishers association which has bitterly opposed google for years , rejected the accord as a " creeping takeover . " " this accord is like a trojan horse , " alexander skipis , chief executive of the boersenverein , said in a statement on thursday , oct .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has already digitized some 7 million books the boersenverein has funded a pay-for-use book-scanning service for german-language books , libreka . google , which has scanned 7 million books to include their contents in its internet search engine , announced tuesday it would let us users read the pages of books that are out of print but are still in copyright . under the settlement with the us authors guild and the association of american publishers , royalties will be paid for past and future use of the books by google . millions of the books are outdated and their authors dead , so a google-funded book registry will be set up to discover who now owns the copyrights .
google said it hoped to reach similar deals to benefit europe and asia . in the united states the google accord has been widely welcomed , since the bulk of books existing today are hard to obtain , as they are no longer on sale and uneconomic to reprint though their copyrights have not expired . at us public libraries , those books from recent decades will be visible in their entirety on library computers , while 20 per cent of those books will be visible to home users . for readers in the rest of the world , google will only be showing about two lines of text at a time . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government is planning to introduce a two-year , tax-free scheme for new environmentally-friendly cars .
but environmentalists have warned the plan will backfire because the criteria are not strict enough . " we want to introduce an automobile tax exemption for cars that are particularly clean , " environment minister sigmar gabriel told ard public television on thursday , oct .
30 .
" that is the proposal that the finance minister will present .
but we still need the approval of the federal states . " automobile taxes are raised by germany 's 16 states and gabriel said finance minister peer steinbrueck would negotiate with the states about how to make up for the resulting tax shortfall . " we of course do not want the states to shoulder the burden on their own , " gabriel said . the tax breaks are likely to last one or two years depending on the car 's particular specifications . criteria not strict enough , say environmentalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentally , japan is still putting the german car industry to shame environmentalists attacked the proposal saying the criteria for the tax exemption were so lax they would include most new cars including gas guzzlers such as sport utility vehicles , which since 2005 have had to meet new emissions standards . " petrol-thirsty automobiles with big motors will benefit , " the ngo german environmental aid said in a statement , calling chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition as " car-driven . " " this is a giant purchase incentive for climate killers , " it said . the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , juergen trittin , has attacked the move , saying the government was acting blindly .
he said cabinet members were organizing a sell-off of pollution-spewing gas guzzlers . " if people are to be encouraged to buy , then they have to promote the purchase of low-consumption cars - of vehicles that produce less than 120 gram of co2 per kilometer , " the former environment minister urged . the german newspaper rheinische post said the tax break would probably cost 2 billion euros in 2009 , citing government sources . older cars would not be eligible for the exemption , which gabriel said the cabinet planned to approve next wednesday and roll out on jan .

co2 emissions are blamed for driving global warming . german carmakers welcome the plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups say the proposal is nothing but a support for carmakers the car industry in both europe and the united states has been appealing to governments to act to revive sales in the financial-crisis struck sector .

he also added that the industry would welcome a tax based on the level of co2 emissions . with credit scarce and sales plunging , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen threw his weight on wednesday behind a call to give the bloc 's carmakers cheap loans worth up to 40 billion euros to invest in the development of eco-friendly cars during the financial crisis . the car industry is a key pillar of europe 's biggest economy , home to giants including volkswagen , bmw and porsche .

" we of course do not want the states to shoulder the burden on their own , " gabriel said . the tax breaks are likely to last one or two years depending on the car 's particular specifications . criteria not strict enough , say environmentalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentally , japan is still putting the german car industry to shame environmentalists attacked the proposal saying the criteria for the tax exemption were so lax they would include most new cars including gas guzzlers such as sport utility vehicles , which since 2005 have had to meet new emissions standards . " petrol-thirsty automobiles with big motors will benefit , " the ngo german environmental aid said in a statement , calling chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition as " car-driven . " " this is a giant purchase incentive for climate killers , " it said . the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary group , juergen trittin , has attacked the move , saying the government was acting blindly .
he said cabinet members were organizing a sell-off of pollution-spewing gas guzzlers . " if people are to be encouraged to buy , then they have to promote the purchase of low-consumption cars - of vehicles that produce less than 120 gram of co2 per kilometer , " the former environment minister urged . the german newspaper rheinische post said the tax break would probably cost 2 billion euros in 2009 , citing government sources . older cars would not be eligible for the exemption , which gabriel said the cabinet planned to approve next wednesday and roll out on jan .
1 . gabriel said berlin aimed to eventually introduce a sliding scale for car tax pegged to the amount of carbon emissions that they produce rather than the size of their engines .
co2 emissions are blamed for driving global warming . german carmakers welcome the plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups say the proposal is nothing but a support for carmakers the car industry in both europe and the united states has been appealing to governments to act to revive sales in the financial-crisis struck sector .
the vda , the german automobile industry 's biggest interest group , welcomed the plan . " the tax holiday proposed today for new cars can provide an impetus to spur sales of vehicles , stabilize the economy and thus ensure jobs in germany , " vda president matthias wissmann said in a statement .
he also added that the industry would welcome a tax based on the level of co2 emissions . with credit scarce and sales plunging , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen threw his weight on wednesday behind a call to give the bloc 's carmakers cheap loans worth up to 40 billion euros to invest in the development of eco-friendly cars during the financial crisis . the car industry is a key pillar of europe 's biggest economy , home to giants including volkswagen , bmw and porsche .
up to now , the sector has been rather resistant to moving away from its traditional niche market of large , luxury cars with big engines . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german book publishers denounced a historic accord between google and us authors , dubbing it trick that would make the us company the master of the world 's knowledge . the boersenverein , the german booksellers and publishers association which has bitterly opposed google for years , rejected the accord as a " creeping takeover . " " this accord is like a trojan horse , " alexander skipis , chief executive of the boersenverein , said in a statement on thursday , oct .
30 .
" google aims to achieve worldwide control of knowledge and culture . " in the name of cultural diversity , this american model is out of the question for europe , " he said , adding that it contradicted " the european ideal of diversity through competition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has already digitized some 7 million books the boersenverein has funded a pay-for-use book-scanning service for german-language books , libreka . google , which has scanned 7 million books to include their contents in its internet search engine , announced tuesday it would let us users read the pages of books that are out of print but are still in copyright . under the settlement with the us authors guild and the association of american publishers , royalties will be paid for past and future use of the books by google . millions of the books are outdated and their authors dead , so a google-funded book registry will be set up to discover who now owns the copyrights .
google said it hoped to reach similar deals to benefit europe and asia . in the united states the google accord has been widely welcomed , since the bulk of books existing today are hard to obtain , as they are no longer on sale and uneconomic to reprint though their copyrights have not expired . at us public libraries , those books from recent decades will be visible in their entirety on library computers , while 20 per cent of those books will be visible to home users . for readers in the rest of the world , google will only be showing about two lines of text at a time . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mid-way through my initial conversation with andrew slaughter , mp for ealing , acton and shepherds bush , he turned and broke into a run , with no obvious explanation .
mr slaughter had spotted a traffic warden surveying his car which he had parked on a double yellow line after a fruitless search for a parking space near shepherds bush tube station .
reaching his car as the warden approached , i joined mr slaughter in his quest for a space for another 20 minutes .
residents and businesses in the area said they face the same predicament every day as scarce parking and traffic jams have become a regular feature since construction began of the westfield shopping centre .

shepherds bush green will also get a £ 3m revamp and another £ 4m will be spent on providing 24-hour policing , a new library and 78 affordable homes .
most local businesses are optimistic and hope the millions flocking to westfield will also benefit the diverse and multi-ethnic high street .
but traffic woes feature high in their concerns as there are only 4,500 parking spaces in the centre .
roadworks have led to traffic jams and scarce parking jamie bishop , 35 , owner of jumbucks pie shop , said : " i think parking is an issue anyway and if there is not enough in the westfield complex there has to be something so that those cars do n't come to the local area .

mid-way through my initial conversation with andrew slaughter , mp for ealing , acton and shepherds bush , he turned and broke into a run , with no obvious explanation .
mr slaughter had spotted a traffic warden surveying his car which he had parked on a double yellow line after a fruitless search for a parking space near shepherds bush tube station .
reaching his car as the warden approached , i joined mr slaughter in his quest for a space for another 20 minutes .
residents and businesses in the area said they face the same predicament every day as scarce parking and traffic jams have become a regular feature since construction began of the westfield shopping centre .
it 's not all about westfield , it 's about residents jamie bishop , shop owner the £ 1.7bn shoppers ' mecca , one of the biggest in europe , aims to attract 60,000 visitors per day with its 265 shops , 50 restaurants and a multiplex cinema .
hammersmith and fulham council said it had " negotiated a series of major community benefits out of westfield " which included £ 200m spent on new tube , train and bus stations .
shepherds bush green will also get a £ 3m revamp and another £ 4m will be spent on providing 24-hour policing , a new library and 78 affordable homes .
most local businesses are optimistic and hope the millions flocking to westfield will also benefit the diverse and multi-ethnic high street .
but traffic woes feature high in their concerns as there are only 4,500 parking spaces in the centre .
roadworks have led to traffic jams and scarce parking jamie bishop , 35 , owner of jumbucks pie shop , said : " i think parking is an issue anyway and if there is not enough in the westfield complex there has to be something so that those cars do n't come to the local area .
" it 's not all about westfield , it 's about residents . "
mr slaughter agreed saying : " very few people are against the regeneration .
you are looking at a site which has not been properly used since the 1908 olympics . "
he accused transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- of being " supine " , adding : " the council has done absolutely nothing to look at either the parking or the congestion after westfield opens . "
he also criticised the council 's plan to review the traffic situation in march , saying : " i can tell them now in advance , there is no parking space on the streets for residents and there is already often gridlock around shepherds bush green and surrounding roads . "
' pathetic ' jobs target westfield said it has contributed £ 170m towards overhauling public transport so that 60 % of its visitors use it .
the council said the improvements will help shepherds bush " realise its full potential " but said tfl needed " to do more " .
" tfl 's own research proves hammersmith and fulham already has the most clogged-up streets in london with a staggering 7.6 million hours lost in traffic every year , " a spokesman said .
" the council leader has warned that without urgent action on issues like the phasing of traffic lights and better north-south routes , drivers will be left further behind . "
the council is investing £ 3m to revamp shepherds bush green tfl said its arrangements were " robust " and added that it " will continue to investigate the best ways of alleviating congestion " .
but it highlighted that congestion due to " road works on wood lane do not relate to tfl " .
apart from traffic issues , labour mp mr slaughter accused the tory council of " excluding " the local community and said the council target of securing up to 1,000 of the 7,000 future jobs at the centre for the area was " pathetic " .
" this is an area with high unemployment and stubborn unemployment .
the council have done nothing about it . "
but the council said it was " on target " and added : " out of 1,300 jobs reported to date , 268 have gone to our residents , which is actually one in five . "
' buy-to-let interest ' the building work at the shopping centre and shepherds bush station for the past year has also angered a number of residents .
hope james , 72 , a retired interior designer , lives in a listed georgian terraced cottage behind the station and the shopping centre looms over her road .
" it 's actually a contrast to a georgian street , it is something very modern .
" it was an assurance that we would have the acoustic protection , at least the council committed to it .
this has not happened . "
ms james said she will seek a reduction in council tax ms james said she and other residents were thinking of seeking compensation and asking for a reduction in their council tax .
" we feel powerless , " she said .
the council said it had done all it could " to limit the noise and disruption " .
despite concerns about the impact of the development on properties values , local estate agents said there had been a lot of interest in buy-to-let investments in the area since the summer .
one agency said an image boost for " the historically fairly run-down area " had been a long time coming and the shopping centre and transport links " gentrified " it .

mid-way through my initial conversation with andrew slaughter , mp for ealing , acton and shepherds bush , he turned and broke into a run , with no obvious explanation .
mr slaughter had spotted a traffic warden surveying his car which he had parked on a double yellow line after a fruitless search for a parking space near shepherds bush tube station .
reaching his car as the warden approached , i joined mr slaughter in his quest for a space for another 20 minutes .
residents and businesses in the area said they face the same predicament every day as scarce parking and traffic jams have become a regular feature since construction began of the westfield shopping centre .
it 's not all about westfield , it 's about residents jamie bishop , shop owner the £ 1.7bn shoppers ' mecca , one of the biggest in europe , aims to attract 60,000 visitors per day with its 265 shops , 50 restaurants and a multiplex cinema .
hammersmith and fulham council said it had " negotiated a series of major community benefits out of westfield " which included £ 200m spent on new tube , train and bus stations .
shepherds bush green will also get a £ 3m revamp and another £ 4m will be spent on providing 24-hour policing , a new library and 78 affordable homes .
most local businesses are optimistic and hope the millions flocking to westfield will also benefit the diverse and multi-ethnic high street .
but traffic woes feature high in their concerns as there are only 4,500 parking spaces in the centre .
roadworks have led to traffic jams and scarce parking jamie bishop , 35 , owner of jumbucks pie shop , said : " i think parking is an issue anyway and if there is not enough in the westfield complex there has to be something so that those cars do n't come to the local area .
" it 's not all about westfield , it 's about residents . "
mr slaughter agreed saying : " very few people are against the regeneration .
you are looking at a site which has not been properly used since the 1908 olympics . "
he accused transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- of being " supine " , adding : " the council has done absolutely nothing to look at either the parking or the congestion after westfield opens . "
he also criticised the council 's plan to review the traffic situation in march , saying : " i can tell them now in advance , there is no parking space on the streets for residents and there is already often gridlock around shepherds bush green and surrounding roads . "
' pathetic ' jobs target westfield said it has contributed £ 170m towards overhauling public transport so that 60 % of its visitors use it .
the council said the improvements will help shepherds bush " realise its full potential " but said tfl needed " to do more " .
" tfl 's own research proves hammersmith and fulham already has the most clogged-up streets in london with a staggering 7.6 million hours lost in traffic every year , " a spokesman said .
" the council leader has warned that without urgent action on issues like the phasing of traffic lights and better north-south routes , drivers will be left further behind . "
the council is investing £ 3m to revamp shepherds bush green tfl said its arrangements were " robust " and added that it " will continue to investigate the best ways of alleviating congestion " .
but it highlighted that congestion due to " road works on wood lane do not relate to tfl " .
apart from traffic issues , labour mp mr slaughter accused the tory council of " excluding " the local community and said the council target of securing up to 1,000 of the 7,000 future jobs at the centre for the area was " pathetic " .
" this is an area with high unemployment and stubborn unemployment .
the council have done nothing about it . "
but the council said it was " on target " and added : " out of 1,300 jobs reported to date , 268 have gone to our residents , which is actually one in five . "
' buy-to-let interest ' the building work at the shopping centre and shepherds bush station for the past year has also angered a number of residents .

mid-way through my initial conversation with andrew slaughter , mp for ealing , acton and shepherds bush , he turned and broke into a run , with no obvious explanation .
mr slaughter had spotted a traffic warden surveying his car which he had parked on a double yellow line after a fruitless search for a parking space near shepherds bush tube station .
reaching his car as the warden approached , i joined mr slaughter in his quest for a space for another 20 minutes .
residents and businesses in the area said they face the same predicament every day as scarce parking and traffic jams have become a regular feature since construction began of the westfield shopping centre .
it 's not all about westfield , it 's about residents jamie bishop , shop owner the £ 1.7bn shoppers ' mecca , one of the biggest in europe , aims to attract 60,000 visitors per day with its 265 shops , 50 restaurants and a multiplex cinema .
hammersmith and fulham council said it had " negotiated a series of major community benefits out of westfield " which included £ 200m spent on new tube , train and bus stations .
shepherds bush green will also get a £ 3m revamp and another £ 4m will be spent on providing 24-hour policing , a new library and 78 affordable homes .
most local businesses are optimistic and hope the millions flocking to westfield will also benefit the diverse and multi-ethnic high street .
but traffic woes feature high in their concerns as there are only 4,500 parking spaces in the centre .
roadworks have led to traffic jams and scarce parking jamie bishop , 35 , owner of jumbucks pie shop , said : " i think parking is an issue anyway and if there is not enough in the westfield complex there has to be something so that those cars do n't come to the local area .
" it 's not all about westfield , it 's about residents . "
mr slaughter agreed saying : " very few people are against the regeneration .
you are looking at a site which has not been properly used since the 1908 olympics . "
he accused transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- of being " supine " , adding : " the council has done absolutely nothing to look at either the parking or the congestion after westfield opens . "
he also criticised the council 's plan to review the traffic situation in march , saying : " i can tell them now in advance , there is no parking space on the streets for residents and there is already often gridlock around shepherds bush green and surrounding roads . "
' pathetic ' jobs target westfield said it has contributed £ 170m towards overhauling public transport so that 60 % of its visitors use it .
the council said the improvements will help shepherds bush " realise its full potential " but said tfl needed " to do more " .
" tfl 's own research proves hammersmith and fulham already has the most clogged-up streets in london with a staggering 7.6 million hours lost in traffic every year , " a spokesman said .
" the council leader has warned that without urgent action on issues like the phasing of traffic lights and better north-south routes , drivers will be left further behind . "
the council is investing £ 3m to revamp shepherds bush green tfl said its arrangements were " robust " and added that it " will continue to investigate the best ways of alleviating congestion " .

" tfl 's own research proves hammersmith and fulham already has the most clogged-up streets in london with a staggering 7.6 million hours lost in traffic every year , " a spokesman said .
" the council leader has warned that without urgent action on issues like the phasing of traffic lights and better north-south routes , drivers will be left further behind . "
tfl said its arrangements were " robust " and added that it " will continue to investigate the best ways of alleviating congestion " .
but it highlighted that congestion due to " road works on wood lane do not relate to tfl " .
apart from traffic issues , labour mp mr slaughter accused the tory council of " excluding " the local community and said the council target of securing up to 1,000 of the 7,000 future jobs at the centre for the area was " pathetic " .
" this is an area with high unemployment and stubborn unemployment .
the council have done nothing about it . "
but the council said it was " on target " and added : " out of 1,300 jobs reported to date , 268 have gone to our residents , which is actually one in five . "
' buy-to-let interest ' the building work at the shopping centre and shepherds bush station for the past year has also angered a number of residents .
hope james , 72 , a retired interior designer , lives in a listed georgian terraced cottage behind the station and the shopping centre looms over her road .
" it 's actually a contrast to a georgian street , it is something very modern .
" it was an assurance that we would have the acoustic protection , at least the council committed to it .
this has not happened . "
ms james said she and other residents were thinking of seeking compensation and asking for a reduction in their council tax .
" we feel powerless , " she said .
the council said it had done all it could " to limit the noise and disruption " .
despite concerns about the impact of the development on properties values , local estate agents said there had been a lot of interest in buy-to-let investments in the area since the summer .
one agency said an image boost for " the historically fairly run-down area " had been a long time coming and the shopping centre and transport links " gentrified " it .

advertisement shopping centre ' may struggle ' a £ 100m shopping centre is to open , amid mixed forecasts for its future in a struggling economy .
wrexham council claims now is a " good time " for the town 's eagles meadow development to open its doors .
but retail specialist experian said the centre faced a " very challenging " economic climate which could be " as bad as the 1930s " .
centre managers claim the 400,000 sq ft complex will catapult the town into the uk 's top 80 retail destinations .
the opening of the complex , which stands on the site of the old cattle market , will be marked with a carnival procession through the town .
it brings opportunities and jobs to wrexham at a time when there is a general economic down-turn steve bayley , wrexham council but amid the celebrations , some financial experts are warning the centre could struggle .
bruno rost , of retail analysis specialists experian , said nobody could have predicted the economic gloom when construction started in 2006 .
he said three million square feet of retail space had been added in towns and cities across the uk so far in 2008 , at a time which some thought could be " as bad as the 1930s " .
he added : " it 's going to be very challenging .
" we have seen more retail space opened in this last year than any time since 1976 and we 're saying it could n't have come at a worse time .
workers were still adding the finishing touches an hour before opening " if they had the chance to open in better economic climes there would have been no argument about it , but unfortunately these things are pre-planned .
" it 's certainly not a good time .
it 's going to be very difficult . "
the complex - originally budgeted at £ 95m - will house more than 30 shops including jd sports , la senza , starbucks , debenhams and marks and spencer .
next , h & m and river island are also among those set to open stores .
the centre will boast restaurants , a bowling alley and there are plans for an eight-screen odeon multiplex in april 2009 .
despite concerns that customers will be forced to tighten their belts amid warnings of a looming recession , wrexham council said the opening came at a good time .
opportunities steve bayley , chief economic development officer , said : " this is a good time for this development to be opening as it brings opportunities and jobs to wrexham at a time when there is a general economic down-turn .
" as the economy recovers , wrexham will be in a position to offer further opportunities to other retail and leisure providers .
" the scheme was always planned to open in autumn 2008 and is opening on-schedule and on-budget . "
speaking last month , the centre 's manager simon pullen , admitted it was " a difficult time " to open .
" but if people see they can come to eagles meadow , i think they 'll spend their money here and maybe cut back on other things , " he added .
its opening will see the closure of some existing town centre stores , including marks and spencer .

rhys livsey , 29 , from cardiff , withdrew the money from kaupthing edge a day before it was taken over by ing direct after a financial crisis in iceland .
in an email the company told mr livsey his money " had been held up " .
a spokesman for ing direct said the administrators were working on clearing payments from prior to the takeover .
mr livsey , who works as a pa , told bbc news he had decided to move his money , a total of £ 24,067 , after reading some reports of problems with the bank on the internet .
he made the transfer to another account on 6 october , and the money cleared from his edge instant access savings account on 7 october , but has failed to arrive in his account .
kaupthing edge , an online uk subsidiary of iceland 's kaupthing bank , was taken over by ing direct on 8 october , and guaranteed all the deposits held in the bank . "
whenever i phone them , they 're just fobbing you off " rhys livsey mr livsey has telephoned the company at least twice a week to find out what is happening with the money , but says he has only been given a standard response , rather than one looking specifically at his situation .
he said : " i get the impression they know the money is n't going to get through .
i just feel there is n't much i can do .
" whenever i phone them , they 're just fobbing you off .
they say they 're trying to trace the money and they 'll get back to you in a couple of days .
" one girl did get back to me but she could n't tell me anything . "
delays after a further phone call on wednesday , mr livsey received an email which stated : " regrettably i have to inform you that the recent transaction from your kaupthing edge account to your nominated linked account has been identified as being held up . "
the company added they were working with a clearing bank to release the money , and stressed the money was " safe " , promising to refund the loss of interest caused by the delay .
however , mr livsey said he had had assurances before that the money would be released and it had not been .
he has also asked the bank to advance him a proportion of the money , but that has not happened .
" i would n't mind if i could just get a grand -lrb- £ 1,000 -rrb- on it , " he said .
" i pay for things on credit card and pay it off at the end of the month so there 's about a four-week delay , but i 'm starting to run short of money , " he added .
he also wanted to know if they would pay any charges if he ran into overdraft as a result of the delay , but the company said he could only send a complaint once the problem had been resolved and they would look at it then .
a statement on ing direct 's website posted on wednesday evening said : " there are still outstanding payments that need to be resolved and the majority involve payments originally requested between the 6-8 october .
" this was at the time when the company went into administration and before the transfer to ing direct happened .
" the administrator tells us that these payments are now being made and we will be working with them to clear these final payments . "
a spokesman for ing direct said he could not give an actual timescale for payment .

rhys livsey , 29 , from cardiff , withdrew the money from kaupthing edge a day before it was taken over by ing direct after a financial crisis in iceland .
in an email the company told mr livsey his money " had been held up " .
a spokesman for ing direct said the administrators were working on clearing payments from prior to the takeover .
mr livsey , who works as a pa , told bbc news he had decided to move his money , a total of £ 24,067 , after reading some reports of problems with the bank on the internet .
he made the transfer to another account on 6 october , and the money cleared from his edge instant access savings account on 7 october , but has failed to arrive in his account .
kaupthing edge , an online uk subsidiary of iceland 's kaupthing bank , was taken over by ing direct on 8 october , and guaranteed all the deposits held in the bank .
whenever i phone them , they 're just fobbing you off rhys livsey mr livsey has telephoned the company at least twice a week to find out what is happening with the money , but says he has only been given a standard response , rather than one looking specifically at his situation .
he said : " i get the impression they know the money is n't going to get through .
i just feel there is n't much i can do .
" whenever i phone them , they 're just fobbing you off .
they say they 're trying to trace the money and they 'll get back to you in a couple of days .
" one girl did get back to me but she could n't tell me anything . "
delays after a further phone call on wednesday , mr livsey received an email which stated : " regrettably i have to inform you that the recent transaction from your kaupthing edge account to your nominated linked account has been identified as being held up . "
the company added they were working with a clearing bank to release the money , and stressed the money was " safe " , promising to refund the loss of interest caused by the delay .
however , mr livsey said he had had assurances before that the money would be released and it had not been .
he has also asked the bank to advance him a proportion of the money , but that has not happened .
" i would n't mind if i could just get a grand -lrb- £ 1,000 -rrb- on it , " he said .
" i pay for things on credit card and pay it off at the end of the month so there 's about a four-week delay , but i 'm starting to run short of money , " he added .
he also wanted to know if they would pay any charges if he ran into overdraft as a result of the delay , but the company said he could only send a complaint once the problem had been resolved and they would look at it then .
a statement on ing direct 's website posted on wednesday evening said : " there are still outstanding payments that need to be resolved and the majority involve payments originally requested between the 6-8 october .
" this was at the time when the company went into administration and before the transfer to ing direct happened .
" the administrator tells us that these payments are now being made and we will be working with them to clear these final payments . "
a spokesman for ing direct said he could not give an actual timescale for payment .

the vulcan hotel in adamsdown , cardiff , is due to close next year to make way for a car park .
but the national history museum at st fagans near cardiff is keen to add a pub to its collection of buildings .
a museum spokesperson said it would " gladly consider " preserving the vulcan at st fagans and would be taking a " closer look " at the pub .
the vulcan , which still has some of its original features , is one of cardiff 's oldest pubs and has previously been voted the city 's pub of the year .
the characters that come here , they 're great , you have a laugh pub regular ray gates a spokesperson for the museum said : " we are actively looking to add a pub to our buildings collections at st fagans national history museum and we intend to take a closer look at the vulcan hotel in the near future .
" we would have to look at the suitability of the building and take into account various considerations such as if it has original fixtures and fittings for example .
" buildings are normally offered to us and if the owner was to donate it , we would gladly consider it . "
pub regulars said they were disappointed the vulcan was being demolished but liked the idea of preserving the pub at the museum .
student steve perry , 19 , said : " it would be better than seeing it knocked to the ground as rubble .
" it 's a shame it 's going to go because the atmosphere in the pub is brilliant .
it 's all about the atmosphere and the people . "
" it 's a welsh version of cheers ! " added fellow student gwilym pugh , 22 .
ray gates , 64 , of roath in cardiff , often visits the pub and will be sad to see it disappear .

" i probably would go to see it -lsb- at the museum -rsb- to see how similar it is to this , " he said .
" you ca n't beat this place .
the characters that come here , they 're great , you have a laugh . "
brian smart , whose wife elizabeth is landlady , would have mixed feelings if the pub was rebuilt at the museum but said it would be " better than seeing it go to dust " .
" it would n't be the same to see an empty pub there and for it to be locked up every night , " he said .
" they travel from all over cardiff to come here .
they keep coming back . "
sa brain , which runs the pub , has been served a compulsory purchase order but an exact closing date has not been fixed , although mr smart said the pub was due to close its doors next june .
isabelle whitehouse of sa brain said : " sa brain & co ltd have been served a compulsory purchase order and currently have an open-ended lease agreed for the vulcan with the developers .
" within this agreement the developers have to give notice for the termination of the lease .
to date we have not received a notice from the developers so we are unsure of a closing date . "
we asked you for your views on what should happen to the vulcan .
here is a selection .
as a regular and long time drinker in the vulc i feel a bit like the character mark e smith of the fall depicts in that band 's 1983 classic single ' the man whose head expanded ' , in that of late i have been heard to espouse the notion that the pub should be rebuilt brick by brick at st fagans .
more than that , it should be run as it is now on the new site .
it is a fabulous pub and in these days when all pubs are becoming identical - you know the score ; knocked into one big room , piped music that only a moron would want to suffer , massive sky screens - if there is n't room in a city as big as cardiff for several old style , what some would call ' proper ' , pubs like the vulcan then lets just give up and stay home and admit that the yahoos have won .
barrie francis , cardiff the vulcan is simply a great pub which must be saved and if that means moving it to st fagans then sobeit and it would certainly enhance the facilities at st fagans too !
nic browne , caerphilly , wales there are so few reminders of cardiff 's victorian past , it would be great if the museum - and brewery - could rebuild the vulcan at a city location as a working pub .
why not recreate it as it was in the 19th century , with bar staff in suitable costume ?
it might be too much to ask for the prices to go back in time , but the theme pub could be a tourist attraction and money-spinner for the museum .
steve -lrb- camra member -rrb- , cardiff as far as i am concerned the pub should stay where it is .
there is no excuse for this cultural vandalism .
if they want to build a car park make them build around the pub , enough of old cardiff has disappeared already !
lee gillum , sully , wales what would be even better than moving the vulcan to st fagans would be to leave it where it is and get the developers to incorporate it into their designs .
i 'm starting a proper campaign to preserve this part of cardiff 's history .
there is an online petition with over 250 signatures and rising .
look out for campaign stories in the echo and on bbc wales cos the vulcan 's not for demolishing !
too many historic cardiff pubs have been knocked down in recent years - the red house and the inn on the river to name but two .
the council has presided over the demolition of cardiff history .
they need to learn that not everything has to be shiny and new .
graham craig , cardiff once again cardiff lets itself down .
is it intent on removing all trace of character from the city ?
it seems any building with any history connected to it is demolished all in the name of progress / car parks / luxury apartments !
first the red house now the vulcan ... the list is endless .
are we destined to socialise in a city made up of soulless bars & wetherspoons ? !
mr jones , cardiff i have travelled the world and never drank in a more authentic , welcoming , classic british pub than the vulcan .
it is just madness to turn it into a car park - please do n't let this happen cardiff .
mike , cardiff , uk what is the council on ?
cardiff is becoming increasingly souless with the city reduced to chain bars and " luxury " one bed flat complexes .
the links between the developers and councillors should be more throughly investigated .
mogg , cardiff this on of the great classic pubs in cardiff if not the whole uk.it would be a great shame to lose it and every effort should be made to save it . but if it has to go then yes rebuild it in st fagans but run it as a proper pub again i 'm sure all the visitors would enjoy a drink in there .
martyn lewis , pontypridd it is always a difficult decision whether to keep a building in its location or to move it to a museum .
places are changing all the time and if the vulcan was kept where it is it would be part of another phase in the development of the area .
in a museum it would be out of context and ' fossilised ' .
who knows , when the vulcan was built perhaps someone said ' that modern pub is spoiling the look of our area ' !
whatever the outcome the pub should be preserved and hopefully if it does move to st. fagans will still serve a good pint of brains !
tim copeland , cheltenham england cardiff has no character or beauty , it pulls it all down for shopping centres and car parks , then pulls them down again and builds again .
it is pubs and buildings like the vulcan that make a city .
cardiff has no atmosphere of its own , no sense of its history , no charm .
the is very little pleasure to be gained from visiting beyond shopping .
i far prefer to go to bath or bristol .
if the vulcan was allowed to remain it would thrive with the new university building opposite .
it is such a shame , cardiff should be embarrassed sam , cardiff do we have to destroy all our heritage for the sake of the motor car .
this pub is a favourite pub with new zealand rugby supporters & friends of mine .
they like to see how cardiff was & but not in a museum. bill davies i 've recently left cardiff for a short while and it 's made me realise what cardiff is losing .
pubs like the vulcan are a plenty in other cities - somewhere you can go to without having dressed for the intention of a big night out .
they also bring groups of people together who would perhaps not meet otherwise - old and young , student and local -lrb- something that really suits the nature of cardiff -rrb- .
and what replaces them ?
shoddy clubs and pubs designed to last until the next financial year .
my fear is that in a few years time all the pubs with a sense of history and a community will have gone and , if drinking habits change , many of the new clubs will become derelict buildings .
emma , london how about applying for it to be listed then they 'd have to build around it !
jill , formerly of cardiff ; currently in northampton it would be very sad to see a lovely old pub like this close .
here in manchester they have moved two old pubs , not once , but twice , to accommodate new developments .
they are hugely successful businesses and have been sensitively integrated into a new urban setting .
it is time cardiff city planners and developers showed some imagination and did something to retain what is evidently a very popular local pub .
john beswick , manchester i agree with the comments made , i have lived in cardiff for 38 years and we do not seem to have much of our heritage buildings remaining , particularly one over 100 years old .
to demolish the vulcan in favour of a car park is nothing more than historic vandalism by the council and developers -lrb- who i doubt are from cardiff -rrb- .
why ca n't this pub be incorporated into the development of the new car park ?
i 'm sure today 's advancements in design and building can accommodate the vulcan within the design .
take a look at the atrium across the road from the vulcan , which looks amazing and has been built around the shell of an old cardiff office block .
the council should be the ones in the museum ! !
lee , cardiff i suggest the cardiff planners are taken to the vulcan on international day .
then they 'd know what they are doing to us .
unbelievable .
david rees , london come on , there is surely enough car parks in cardiff as it is ! !
why ca n't we keep part of our history going .
everything that has character is being demolished and replaced with souless pubs with no class ! !
let 's be proud of our historical buildings .
lee jefferies , cardiff , wales i 'm not cardiff born but have lived here for nearly 30 years .
in that time i have seen cardiff go from a city with real character and atmosphere to another characterless " design a city " lookalike .
to demolish a pub like this which is so evocative of old cardiff for yet another car park , is disgraceful .
is it not government policy to discourage inner city car usage ?
this pub was here long before the car was invented and could , with a degree of sense from city planners , be here long after the oil has run out .
this pub should be saved in it 's original location .
pete , cardiff i still ca n't believe that anyone would possibly have the notion of destroying a pub for a car park .
it 's going to cost £ 5 a day to park there , but the bus is £ 3 return from the edge of the city and there are park and ride schemes at many rail stations both in cardiff and the surrounding valleys , and fares for the closest stations -lrb- caerphilly , treforest etc -rrb- are cheaper than £ 5 return .
what is the council up to ?
matthew smith , cardiff the vulcan is a character pub next to the atrium and is getting very popular with students a cultural hive .
cardiff council must be mad to want to knock it down .
the best cities are a mix of old and new and this is how they thrive .
save the vulcan .
jacqueline jones , rhondda it 's a shame to see the vulcan under threat , but it does n't surprise me at all .
cardiff council want the city to be ' forward looking ' and competing with bristol , birmingham etc. commercially and to hell with history and sentiment -lrb- will they be bulldozing the castle next to put up a waitose ? -rrb-
cardiff is slowly becoming just ' another city ' - where is the hwyl now when we need it ?

martyn lewis , pontypridd it is always a difficult decision whether to keep a building in its location or to move it to a museum .

in a museum it would be out of context and ' fossilised ' .
who knows , when the vulcan was built perhaps someone said ' that modern pub is spoiling the look of our area ' !
whatever the outcome the pub should be preserved and hopefully if it does move to st. fagans will still serve a good pint of brains !

it is pubs and buildings like the vulcan that make a city .

this pub is a favourite pub with new zealand rugby supporters & friends of mine .

pubs like the vulcan are a plenty in other cities - somewhere you can go to without having dressed for the intention of a big night out .
they also bring groups of people together who would perhaps not meet otherwise - old and young , student and local -lrb- something that really suits the nature of cardiff -rrb- .
and what replaces them ?
shoddy clubs and pubs designed to last until the next financial year .
my fear is that in a few years time all the pubs with a sense of history and a community will have gone and , if drinking habits change , many of the new clubs will become derelict buildings .

here in manchester they have moved two old pubs , not once , but twice , to accommodate new developments .

it is time cardiff city planners and developers showed some imagination and did something to retain what is evidently a very popular local pub .
john beswick , manchester i agree with the comments made , i have lived in cardiff for 38 years and we do not seem to have much of our heritage buildings remaining , particularly one over 100 years old .
to demolish the vulcan in favour of a car park is nothing more than historic vandalism by the council and developers -lrb- who i doubt are from cardiff -rrb- .
why ca n't this pub be incorporated into the development of the new car park ?
i 'm sure today 's advancements in design and building can accommodate the vulcan within the design .
take a look at the atrium across the road from the vulcan , which looks amazing and has been built around the shell of an old cardiff office block .
the council should be the ones in the museum ! !

unbelievable .

this pub was here long before the car was invented and could , with a degree of sense from city planners , be here long after the oil has run out .
this pub should be saved in it 's original location .
pete , cardiff i still ca n't believe that anyone would possibly have the notion of destroying a pub for a car park .
it 's going to cost £ 5 a day to park there , but the bus is £ 3 return from the edge of the city and there are park and ride schemes at many rail stations both in cardiff and the surrounding valleys , and fares for the closest stations -lrb- caerphilly , treforest etc -rrb- are cheaper than £ 5 return .
what is the council up to ?
matthew smith , cardiff the vulcan is a character pub next to the atrium and is getting very popular with students a cultural hive .

the vulcan hotel in adamsdown , cardiff , is due to close next year to make way for a car park .
but the national history museum at st fagans near cardiff is keen to add a pub to its collection of buildings .
a museum spokesperson said it would " gladly consider " preserving the vulcan at st fagans and would be taking a " closer look " at the pub .
the vulcan , which still has some of its original features , is one of cardiff 's oldest pubs and has previously been voted the city 's pub of the year .
the characters that come here , they 're great , you have a laugh pub regular ray gates a spokesperson for the museum said : " we are actively looking to add a pub to our buildings collections at st fagans national history museum and we intend to take a closer look at the vulcan hotel in the near future .
" we would have to look at the suitability of the building and take into account various considerations such as if it has original fixtures and fittings for example .
" buildings are normally offered to us and if the owner was to donate it , we would gladly consider it . "
pub regulars said they were disappointed the vulcan was being demolished but liked the idea of preserving the pub at the museum .
student steve perry , 19 , said : " it would be better than seeing it knocked to the ground as rubble .
" it 's a shame it 's going to go because the atmosphere in the pub is brilliant .
it 's all about the atmosphere and the people . "
" it 's a welsh version of cheers ! " added fellow student gwilym pugh , 22 .
ray gates , 64 , of roath in cardiff , often visits the pub and will be sad to see it disappear .

brian smart , whose wife elizabeth is landlady , would have mixed feelings if the pub was rebuilt at the museum but said it would be " better than seeing it go to dust " .
" it would n't be the same to see an empty pub there and for it to be locked up every night , " he said .
" they travel from all over cardiff to come here .
they keep coming back . "
sa brain , which runs the pub , has been served a compulsory purchase order but an exact closing date has not been fixed , although mr smart said the pub was due to close its doors next june .
isabelle whitehouse of sa brain said : " sa brain & co ltd have been served a compulsory purchase order and currently have an open-ended lease agreed for the vulcan with the developers .
" within this agreement the developers have to give notice for the termination of the lease .
to date we have not received a notice from the developers so we are unsure of a closing date . "
we asked you for your views on what should happen to the vulcan .
here is a selection .
as a regular and long time drinker in the vulc i feel a bit like the character mark e smith of the fall depicts in that band 's 1983 classic single ' the man whose head expanded ' , in that of late i have been heard to espouse the notion that the pub should be rebuilt brick by brick at st fagans .
more than that , it should be run as it is now on the new site .
it is a fabulous pub and in these days when all pubs are becoming identical - you know the score ; knocked into one big room , piped music that only a moron would want to suffer , massive sky screens - if there is n't room in a city as big as cardiff for several old style , what some would call ' proper ' , pubs like the vulcan then lets just give up and stay home and admit that the yahoos have won .
barrie francis , cardiff the vulcan is simply a great pub which must be saved and if that means moving it to st fagans then sobeit and it would certainly enhance the facilities at st fagans too !
nic browne , caerphilly , wales there are so few reminders of cardiff 's victorian past , it would be great if the museum - and brewery - could rebuild the vulcan at a city location as a working pub .
why not recreate it as it was in the 19th century , with bar staff in suitable costume ?
it might be too much to ask for the prices to go back in time , but the theme pub could be a tourist attraction and money-spinner for the museum .
steve -lrb- camra member -rrb- , cardiff as far as i am concerned the pub should stay where it is .
there is no excuse for this cultural vandalism .
if they want to build a car park make them build around the pub , enough of old cardiff has disappeared already !
lee gillum , sully , wales what would be even better than moving the vulcan to st fagans would be to leave it where it is and get the developers to incorporate it into their designs .
i 'm starting a proper campaign to preserve this part of cardiff 's history .
there is an online petition with over 250 signatures and rising .
look out for campaign stories in the echo and on bbc wales cos the vulcan 's not for demolishing !
too many historic cardiff pubs have been knocked down in recent years - the red house and the inn on the river to name but two .
the council has presided over the demolition of cardiff history .
they need to learn that not everything has to be shiny and new .
graham craig , cardiff once again cardiff lets itself down .
is it intent on removing all trace of character from the city ?
it seems any building with any history connected to it is demolished all in the name of progress / car parks / luxury apartments !
first the red house now the vulcan ... the list is endless .
are we destined to socialise in a city made up of soulless bars & wetherspoons ? !

the vulcan hotel in adamsdown , cardiff , is due to close next year to make way for a car park .
but the national history museum at st fagans near cardiff is keen to add a pub to its collection of buildings .
a museum spokesperson said it would " gladly consider " preserving the vulcan at st fagans and would be taking a " closer look " at the pub .
the vulcan , which still has some of its original features , is one of cardiff 's oldest pubs and has previously been voted the city 's pub of the year . "
the characters that come here , they 're great , you have a laugh " pub regular ray gates a spokesperson for the museum said : " we are actively looking to add a pub to our buildings collections at st fagans national history museum and we intend to take a closer look at the vulcan hotel in the near future .
" we would have to look at the suitability of the building and take into account various considerations such as if it has original fixtures and fittings for example .
" buildings are normally offered to us and if the owner was to donate it , we would gladly consider it . "
pub regulars said they were disappointed the vulcan was being demolished but liked the idea of preserving the pub at the museum .
student steve perry , 19 , said : " it would be better than seeing it knocked to the ground as rubble .
" it 's a shame it 's going to go because the atmosphere in the pub is brilliant .
it 's all about the atmosphere and the people . "
" it 's a welsh version of cheers ! " added fellow student gwilym pugh , 22 .
ray gates , 64 , of roath in cardiff , often visits the pub and will be sad to see it disappear .
" i probably would go to see it -lsb- at the museum -rsb- to see how similar it is to this , " he said .
" you ca n't beat this place .
the characters that come here , they 're great , you have a laugh . "
brian smart , whose wife elizabeth is landlady , would have mixed feelings if the pub was rebuilt at the museum but said it would be " better than seeing it go to dust " .
" it would n't be the same to see an empty pub there and for it to be locked up every night , " he said .
" they travel from all over cardiff to come here .
they keep coming back . "
sa brain , which runs the pub , has been served a compulsory purchase order but an exact closing date has not been fixed , although mr smart said the pub was due to close its doors next june .
isabelle whitehouse of sa brain said : " sa brain & co ltd have been served a compulsory purchase order and currently have an open-ended lease agreed for the vulcan with the developers .
" within this agreement the developers have to give notice for the termination of the lease .
to date we have not received a notice from the developers so we are unsure of a closing date . "
we asked you for your views on what should happen to the vulcan .
here is a selection .
as a regular and long time drinker in the vulc i feel a bit like the character mark e smith of the fall depicts in that band 's 1983 classic single ' the man whose head expanded ' , in that of late i have been heard to espouse the notion that the pub should be rebuilt brick by brick at st fagans .
more than that , it should be run as it is now on the new site .
it is a fabulous pub and in these days when all pubs are becoming identical - you know the score ; knocked into one big room , piped music that only a moron would want to suffer , massive sky screens - if there is n't room in a city as big as cardiff for several old style , what some would call ' proper ' , pubs like the vulcan then lets just give up and stay home and admit that the yahoos have won .
barrie francis , cardiff the vulcan is simply a great pub which must be saved and if that means moving it to st fagans then sobeit and it would certainly enhance the facilities at st fagans too !
nic browne , caerphilly , wales there are so few reminders of cardiff 's victorian past , it would be great if the museum - and brewery - could rebuild the vulcan at a city location as a working pub .
why not recreate it as it was in the 19th century , with bar staff in suitable costume ?
it might be too much to ask for the prices to go back in time , but the theme pub could be a tourist attraction and money-spinner for the museum .
steve -lrb- camra member -rrb- , cardiff as far as i am concerned the pub should stay where it is .
there is no excuse for this cultural vandalism .
if they want to build a car park make them build around the pub , enough of old cardiff has disappeared already !
lee gillum , sully , wales what would be even better than moving the vulcan to st fagans would be to leave it where it is and get the developers to incorporate it into their designs .
i 'm starting a proper campaign to preserve this part of cardiff 's history .
there is an online petition with over 250 signatures and rising .
look out for campaign stories in the echo and on bbc wales cos the vulcan 's not for demolishing !
too many historic cardiff pubs have been knocked down in recent years - the red house and the inn on the river to name but two .
the council has presided over the demolition of cardiff history .
they need to learn that not everything has to be shiny and new .
graham craig , cardiff once again cardiff lets itself down .
is it intent on removing all trace of character from the city ?
it seems any building with any history connected to it is demolished all in the name of progress / car parks / luxury apartments !
first the red house now the vulcan ... the list is endless .
are we destined to socialise in a city made up of soulless bars & wetherspoons ? !
mr jones , cardiff i have travelled the world and never drank in a more authentic , welcoming , classic british pub than the vulcan .
it is just madness to turn it into a car park - please do n't let this happen cardiff .
mike , cardiff , uk what is the council on ?
cardiff is becoming increasingly souless with the city reduced to chain bars and " luxury " one bed flat complexes .
the links between the developers and councillors should be more throughly investigated .
mogg , cardiff this on of the great classic pubs in cardiff if not the whole uk.it would be a great shame to lose it and every effort should be made to save it . but if it has to go then yes rebuild it in st fagans but run it as a proper pub again i 'm sure all the visitors would enjoy a drink in there .
martyn lewis , pontypridd it is always a difficult decision whether to keep a building in its location or to move it to a museum .
places are changing all the time and if the vulcan was kept where it is it would be part of another phase in the development of the area .
in a museum it would be out of context and ' fossilised ' .
who knows , when the vulcan was built perhaps someone said ' that modern pub is spoiling the look of our area ' !
whatever the outcome the pub should be preserved and hopefully if it does move to st. fagans will still serve a good pint of brains !
tim copeland , cheltenham england cardiff has no character or beauty , it pulls it all down for shopping centres and car parks , then pulls them down again and builds again .
it is pubs and buildings like the vulcan that make a city .
cardiff has no atmosphere of its own , no sense of its history , no charm .
the is very little pleasure to be gained from visiting beyond shopping .
i far prefer to go to bath or bristol .
if the vulcan was allowed to remain it would thrive with the new university building opposite .
it is such a shame , cardiff should be embarrassed sam , cardiff do we have to destroy all our heritage for the sake of the motor car .
this pub is a favourite pub with new zealand rugby supporters & friends of mine .
they like to see how cardiff was & but not in a museum. bill davies i 've recently left cardiff for a short while and it 's made me realise what cardiff is losing .
pubs like the vulcan are a plenty in other cities - somewhere you can go to without having dressed for the intention of a big night out .

the attack is thought to be related to a recent wave of violence against migrant workers from northern india .
dharamdeo rai , 25 , who was from the northern state of uttar pradesh , was travelling with three friends when they were set upon by a larger group .
police said 17 people had been detained for questioning and that a murder investigation was under way .
among those being held were activists of the right-wing maharashtra navnirman sena -lrb- mns -rrb- party , which has been accused of several attacks on migrant workers in recent months .
msn claims migrant workers are taking jobs from local people .
the party chief , raj thackeray , was released on bail last week charged with inciting violence against migrants .
he denies the allegations .
inciting violence reports said that the victim had come to mumbai two months ago and was working in a local steel factory .
a senior police official said mr rai was travelling with three friends to his village in northern india .
" at the same time , a group of 10-12 people boarded the same compartment .
a clash began over seating , as the four occupied window seats , " said vasant koregaonkar .
" the four were beaten up after they were identified as north indians , " he told the indian express newspaper .
earlier this week , a migrant job seeker from bihar was shot dead by police in mumbai .
rahul raj , who was in his early 20s , allegedly shot and injured a passenger on a bus that he had tried to hijack , demanding to meet the politician raj thackeray .
some senior politicians have demanded an investigation , saying police could easily have disarmed the man .
there have been protests in the northern state of bihar , which borders uttar pradesh , over the violence in the mumbai area against migrants .
indian prime minister manmohan singh has reportedly spoken to the chief minister of maharashtra state , of which mumbai is the capital , to ensure the security of migrant workers .
some 37 % of mumbai 's 18m population are migrants drawn to the city in search of work .

they are suspected of being involved in the deaths of 11 young men from bogota , whose bodies were found in mass graves in the north-east of the country .
rights groups say they were kidnapped or lured with the promise of work , then killed in combat zones to inflate army statistics on rebels killed .
one of the sacked officers , gen jose joaquin cortes , denied the allegations .
he told colombian radio : " i still absolutely believe in the innocence of my men . "
the scandal broke last month , after the 11 civilians ' bodies were found in communal graves in north-eastern colombia .
the dismissed soldiers include three generals , 11 colonels , four majors , a captain , a lieutenant , and seven non-commissioned officers .
officials had initially said 25 people had been sacked .
the head of colombia 's armed forces , gen freddy padilla , read out their names at a news conference with president alvaro uribe and defense minister juan manuel santos .
colombia deaths 11 young men disappeared from poor bogota suburb in early 2008 their bodies were found in mass graves near venezuela border in august and september rights groups accuse the army of killing civilians to inflate successes mr uribe said a military inquiry had determined they had been guilty at least of negligence that included allowing " the collusion of members of the army with criminals " in " the murder of innocents " .
he added : " we can not allow any violation of human rights . "
no further details about the soldiers ' alleged role were given .
mr uribe said the cases would be turned over to prosecutors .
the 11 men disappeared from the poor bogota suburb of soacha early this year .
their bodies were found in mass graves near the venezuela border in august and september .

earlier this month the fed cut rates from 2 % to 1.5 % in an emergency move , which was co-ordinated with five other central banks .

the office of rail regulator -lrb- orr -rrb- has confirmed the work to double the track will not be included in network rail 's business plan for 2009-14 .
councillor julie girling of gloucestershire county council said the decision was " unwelcome " .
" this does nothing for improving rail services and encouraging commuters off the road , " said ms girling .
the announcement follows a campaign spearheaded by the county council and backed by commuters , businesses , mps and other local authorities .
the orr announcement said the case was not funded because it was judged to be outside the scope of what the government wanted for improving punctuality and capacity .
a spokesman for the orr said the work could still go ahead within the next five years if the case was resubmitted with funding coming from elsewhere .
kemble to swindon is part of the great western main line from gloucestershire to london paddington . "
it is a sad day for gloucestershire " barry king , gloucestershire county council ms girling said : " network rail identified the business case for this scheme to be a good one and ... the minister for transport tom harris confirmed his awareness of the underlying issues and invited the rail industry to re-submit its case . "
around two-thirds of the line is double track but it reduces to single track between kemble and swindon .
gloucestershire county council director of environment barry king said : " the business case was overwhelming .
" it would have provided the opportunity for a more frequent and reliable service between the county , london and the southeast , boosting gloucestershire 's economy and also providing a robust diversionary route between south wales and london , especially when there are problems with the severn tunnel route .
" the orr has ignored the 2,000 supporters that registered with our petition , our mps , local businesses and the many local authorities that supported our campaign .
