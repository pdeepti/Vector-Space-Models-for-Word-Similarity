program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.02.2008 commissioner says reform treaty vital for eu 's survival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding said there 's a tendency to blame the eu for everything in an interview with dw-tv , viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media , spoke about the reform treaty as a force for change , enlargement and the tendency to blame brussels when things go wrong . dw-tv : the lisbon reform treaty has been signed but has yet to be ratified . could it still fail ? viviane reding : i do n't think so and i hope not as it would not be in the interest of the 500 million people of europe who want to live together peacefully and be a force in a globalized world .
that will only possible if europe speaks with one voice and if we have an internal market .
but for that , we need institutions to work effectively .
the ratification process has begun and will go on .
i 'm sure that a new eu will be fully functional from january next year . how will the treaty of lisbon change the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu made history with the signing of the lisbon treaty last december the institutions will become more effective .
the big winner is the european parliament .
it will have a very strong voice in all decisions .
and i think that 's a good thing , because the european parliament is the democratic institution on this continent .
directly-elected members will have a say in the future of european life and politics .
that is real democracy , and that 's a good thing . many people are talking about where the eu 's borders lie .
what 's your position - should turkey and ukraine be admitted ? that 's something we have to debate in a democratic way with those already inside europe .
but i would like to point out that this discussion has been going on for quite a long time already , and that there was a lot of criticism of past eu expansions - huge criticism of those countries that went from communism to democracy .
but it was the most wonderful reunification project you could imagine in world history .
it was the first time that such a large number of people moved into freedom and self-determination ; and that , not through war , but on a voluntary , democratic basis . all the same , there 's a feeling the eu may have bitten off more than it can chew .
people say it does n't matter if they meet the criteria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enthusiasm for further eu enlargement has waned since the last big round of expansion the ability to absorb new member states is important .
you have to remember that wealthier nations have let in nations that were less well-off .
but we also have to remember that the internal market has expanded greatly , and that was a big boost for an exporter like germany .
this expansion had many plus points , particularly the historical aspect .
because that which history divided , has now been re-united .
i think that with this we set an example for many nations . french president nicolas sarkozy says he wants to establish a mediterranean union ; sceptics say it could tear the eu apart .
are they right ? we already have a mediterranean union with the barcelona process , where the eu formed a solidarity pact with countries south of the mediterranean .
the right thing is to build on that .
but we should n't just look at the mediterranean .
we also need to look to the east .
we have many new neighbors .
and that 's why it 's so important to have the right policies to engage with them . the eu is n't popular among its own citizens at the moment .
what can the commission do in real terms to make the mood a bit more pro-europe ? people have become used to the european union , and when something goes wrong at home , then they think europe is to blame , because national or regional politicians lay all the blame on europe .
and then of course it is difficult , when you have spent six days criticizing europe , to declare on the seventh day that europe has done something well . but take the financial crisis that has spread around the world .
if we did not have the eu , and if we did not have the euro , then all these states would be suffering badly from this crisis .
the union has shown it can maintain stability .
we should n't lose sight of very concrete things like that . a standard criticism you hear is that there 's too much bureaucracy , that the commission loves to centralize .
how do you respond ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is seen by many as a bureaucratic monster every day i meet politicians from member states and members of the european parliament who are always telling me " do this , do that . "
i 'm always being asked to do more .
you really have to put your foot down if you want to do less .
throughout my political career , i 've noticed that when you try to deregulate , you come in for a lot more criticism than when you create new rules . you 've come in for criticism in particular for wanting to set up an eu-wide regulatory body for the telecommunications market . we 're regulating in order to open up markets and introduce more competition .
once we have competition , we no longer need regulatory mechanisms , we can get rid of them .
so why do we need this regulatory authority ?
we have 27 national regulators who do n't always apply european law in a uniform way .
the european single market ca n't work like that .
so it 's vital that instead of having the commission regulating from the top down - we have a supervisory body which groups the 27 national regulators together so that they can regulate their markets in a way that makes sense for the whole of europe . you mean the eu body would have authority over the national bodies ? no , the 27 bodies would work together .
but they would no longer be against each other .
no more could one introduce measures that contradict what the neighbouring country does and which do n't allow our industry to draw on a pan-european market .
instead it 's about building this internal market , with its five hundred million people , attractive - not only for the consumer but also for europe-wide industries . those millions of people do n't all have the same access to media .
anyone wanting to watch dw-tv on the web , for example , needs broadband .
but that 's not available everywhere .
do you have a strategy for spreading broadband ? yes i do , in two ways .
first of all we want broadband for everyone in europe , including those who live in isolated areas .
and then we want european industry to have the opportunity to be involved in that investment .
so my goal is to modernize across the board - so that it 's no longer the select few who are out in front , but all 27 eu states together and everyone with access to a high-speed broadband service . interview : christian f trippe -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but we should n't just look at the mediterranean .
we also need to look to the east .
we have many new neighbors .
and that 's why it 's so important to have the right policies to engage with them . the eu is n't popular among its own citizens at the moment .
what can the commission do in real terms to make the mood a bit more pro-europe ? people have become used to the european union , and when something goes wrong at home , then they think europe is to blame , because national or regional politicians lay all the blame on europe .
and then of course it is difficult , when you have spent six days criticizing europe , to declare on the seventh day that europe has done something well . but take the financial crisis that has spread around the world .
if we did not have the eu , and if we did not have the euro , then all these states would be suffering badly from this crisis .
the union has shown it can maintain stability .
we should n't lose sight of very concrete things like that . a standard criticism you hear is that there 's too much bureaucracy , that the commission loves to centralize .
how do you respond ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is seen by many as a bureaucratic monster every day i meet politicians from member states and members of the european parliament who are always telling me " do this , do that . "
i 'm always being asked to do more .
you really have to put your foot down if you want to do less .
throughout my political career , i 've noticed that when you try to deregulate , you come in for a lot more criticism than when you create new rules . you 've come in for criticism in particular for wanting to set up an eu-wide regulatory body for the telecommunications market . we 're regulating in order to open up markets and introduce more competition .
once we have competition , we no longer need regulatory mechanisms , we can get rid of them .
so why do we need this regulatory authority ?
we have 27 national regulators who do n't always apply european law in a uniform way .
the european single market ca n't work like that .
so it 's vital that instead of having the commission regulating from the top down - we have a supervisory body which groups the 27 national regulators together so that they can regulate their markets in a way that makes sense for the whole of europe . you mean the eu body would have authority over the national bodies ? no , the 27 bodies would work together .
but they would no longer be against each other .
no more could one introduce measures that contradict what the neighbouring country does and which do n't allow our industry to draw on a pan-european market .
instead it 's about building this internal market , with its five hundred million people , attractive - not only for the consumer but also for europe-wide industries . those millions of people do n't all have the same access to media .
anyone wanting to watch dw-tv on the web , for example , needs broadband .
but that 's not available everywhere .
do you have a strategy for spreading broadband ? yes i do , in two ways .
first of all we want broadband for everyone in europe , including those who live in isolated areas .
and then we want european industry to have the opportunity to be involved in that investment .
so my goal is to modernize across the board - so that it 's no longer the select few who are out in front , but all 27 eu states together and everyone with access to a high-speed broadband service . interview : christian f trippe -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that will only possible if europe speaks with one voice and if we have an internal market .
but for that , we need institutions to work effectively .
the ratification process has begun and will go on .
i 'm sure that a new eu will be fully functional from january next year . how will the treaty of lisbon change the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu made history with the signing of the lisbon treaty last december the institutions will become more effective .
the big winner is the european parliament .
it will have a very strong voice in all decisions .
and i think that 's a good thing , because the european parliament is the democratic institution on this continent .
directly-elected members will have a say in the future of european life and politics .
that is real democracy , and that 's a good thing . many people are talking about where the eu 's borders lie .
what 's your position - should turkey and ukraine be admitted ? that 's something we have to debate in a democratic way with those already inside europe .
but i would like to point out that this discussion has been going on for quite a long time already , and that there was a lot of criticism of past eu expansions - huge criticism of those countries that went from communism to democracy .
but it was the most wonderful reunification project you could imagine in world history .
it was the first time that such a large number of people moved into freedom and self-determination ; and that , not through war , but on a voluntary , democratic basis . all the same , there 's a feeling the eu may have bitten off more than it can chew .
people say it does n't matter if they meet the criteria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enthusiasm for further eu enlargement has waned since the last big round of expansion the ability to absorb new member states is important .
you have to remember that wealthier nations have let in nations that were less well-off .
but we also have to remember that the internal market has expanded greatly , and that was a big boost for an exporter like germany .
this expansion had many plus points , particularly the historical aspect .
because that which history divided , has now been re-united .
i think that with this we set an example for many nations . french president nicolas sarkozy says he wants to establish a mediterranean union ; sceptics say it could tear the eu apart .
are they right ? we already have a mediterranean union with the barcelona process , where the eu formed a solidarity pact with countries south of the mediterranean .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.02.2008 commissioner says reform treaty vital for eu 's survival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding said there 's a tendency to blame the eu for everything in an interview with dw-tv , viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media , spoke about the reform treaty as a force for change , enlargement and the tendency to blame brussels when things go wrong . dw-tv : the lisbon reform treaty has been signed but has yet to be ratified . could it still fail ? viviane reding : i do n't think so and i hope not as it would not be in the interest of the 500 million people of europe who want to live together peacefully and be a force in a globalized world .
that will only possible if europe speaks with one voice and if we have an internal market .
but for that , we need institutions to work effectively .
the ratification process has begun and will go on .
i 'm sure that a new eu will be fully functional from january next year . how will the treaty of lisbon change the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu made history with the signing of the lisbon treaty last december the institutions will become more effective .
the big winner is the european parliament .
it will have a very strong voice in all decisions .
and i think that 's a good thing , because the european parliament is the democratic institution on this continent .
directly-elected members will have a say in the future of european life and politics .
that is real democracy , and that 's a good thing . many people are talking about where the eu 's borders lie .
what 's your position - should turkey and ukraine be admitted ? that 's something we have to debate in a democratic way with those already inside europe .
but i would like to point out that this discussion has been going on for quite a long time already , and that there was a lot of criticism of past eu expansions - huge criticism of those countries that went from communism to democracy .
but it was the most wonderful reunification project you could imagine in world history .
it was the first time that such a large number of people moved into freedom and self-determination ; and that , not through war , but on a voluntary , democratic basis . all the same , there 's a feeling the eu may have bitten off more than it can chew .
people say it does n't matter if they meet the criteria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enthusiasm for further eu enlargement has waned since the last big round of expansion the ability to absorb new member states is important .
you have to remember that wealthier nations have let in nations that were less well-off .
but we also have to remember that the internal market has expanded greatly , and that was a big boost for an exporter like germany .
this expansion had many plus points , particularly the historical aspect .
because that which history divided , has now been re-united .
i think that with this we set an example for many nations . french president nicolas sarkozy says he wants to establish a mediterranean union ; sceptics say it could tear the eu apart .
are they right ? we already have a mediterranean union with the barcelona process , where the eu formed a solidarity pact with countries south of the mediterranean .
the right thing is to build on that .
but we should n't just look at the mediterranean .
we also need to look to the east .
we have many new neighbors .
and that 's why it 's so important to have the right policies to engage with them . the eu is n't popular among its own citizens at the moment .
what can the commission do in real terms to make the mood a bit more pro-europe ? people have become used to the european union , and when something goes wrong at home , then they think europe is to blame , because national or regional politicians lay all the blame on europe .
and then of course it is difficult , when you have spent six days criticizing europe , to declare on the seventh day that europe has done something well . but take the financial crisis that has spread around the world .
if we did not have the eu , and if we did not have the euro , then all these states would be suffering badly from this crisis .
the union has shown it can maintain stability .
we should n't lose sight of very concrete things like that . a standard criticism you hear is that there 's too much bureaucracy , that the commission loves to centralize .
how do you respond ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is seen by many as a bureaucratic monster every day i meet politicians from member states and members of the european parliament who are always telling me " do this , do that . "
i 'm always being asked to do more .
you really have to put your foot down if you want to do less .
throughout my political career , i 've noticed that when you try to deregulate , you come in for a lot more criticism than when you create new rules . you 've come in for criticism in particular for wanting to set up an eu-wide regulatory body for the telecommunications market . we 're regulating in order to open up markets and introduce more competition .
once we have competition , we no longer need regulatory mechanisms , we can get rid of them .
so why do we need this regulatory authority ?
we have 27 national regulators who do n't always apply european law in a uniform way .
the european single market ca n't work like that .
so it 's vital that instead of having the commission regulating from the top down - we have a supervisory body which groups the 27 national regulators together so that they can regulate their markets in a way that makes sense for the whole of europe . you mean the eu body would have authority over the national bodies ? no , the 27 bodies would work together .
but they would no longer be against each other .
no more could one introduce measures that contradict what the neighbouring country does and which do n't allow our industry to draw on a pan-european market .
instead it 's about building this internal market , with its five hundred million people , attractive - not only for the consumer but also for europe-wide industries . those millions of people do n't all have the same access to media .
anyone wanting to watch dw-tv on the web , for example , needs broadband .
but that 's not available everywhere .
do you have a strategy for spreading broadband ? yes i do , in two ways .
first of all we want broadband for everyone in europe , including those who live in isolated areas .
and then we want european industry to have the opportunity to be involved in that investment .
so my goal is to modernize across the board - so that it 's no longer the select few who are out in front , but all 27 eu states together and everyone with access to a high-speed broadband service . interview : christian f trippe -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.02.2008 commissioner says reform treaty vital for eu 's survival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding said there 's a tendency to blame the eu for everything in an interview with dw-tv , viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media , spoke about the reform treaty as a force for change , enlargement and the tendency to blame brussels when things go wrong . dw-tv : the lisbon reform treaty has been signed but has yet to be ratified . could it still fail ? viviane reding : i do n't think so and i hope not as it would not be in the interest of the 500 million people of europe who want to live together peacefully and be a force in a globalized world .
that will only possible if europe speaks with one voice and if we have an internal market .
but for that , we need institutions to work effectively .
the ratification process has begun and will go on .
i 'm sure that a new eu will be fully functional from january next year . how will the treaty of lisbon change the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu made history with the signing of the lisbon treaty last december the institutions will become more effective .
the big winner is the european parliament .
it will have a very strong voice in all decisions .
and i think that 's a good thing , because the european parliament is the democratic institution on this continent .
directly-elected members will have a say in the future of european life and politics .
that is real democracy , and that 's a good thing . many people are talking about where the eu 's borders lie .
what 's your position - should turkey and ukraine be admitted ? that 's something we have to debate in a democratic way with those already inside europe .
but i would like to point out that this discussion has been going on for quite a long time already , and that there was a lot of criticism of past eu expansions - huge criticism of those countries that went from communism to democracy .
but it was the most wonderful reunification project you could imagine in world history .
it was the first time that such a large number of people moved into freedom and self-determination ; and that , not through war , but on a voluntary , democratic basis . all the same , there 's a feeling the eu may have bitten off more than it can chew .
people say it does n't matter if they meet the criteria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enthusiasm for further eu enlargement has waned since the last big round of expansion the ability to absorb new member states is important .
you have to remember that wealthier nations have let in nations that were less well-off .
but we also have to remember that the internal market has expanded greatly , and that was a big boost for an exporter like germany .
this expansion had many plus points , particularly the historical aspect .
because that which history divided , has now been re-united .
i think that with this we set an example for many nations . french president nicolas sarkozy says he wants to establish a mediterranean union ; sceptics say it could tear the eu apart .
are they right ? we already have a mediterranean union with the barcelona process , where the eu formed a solidarity pact with countries south of the mediterranean .
the right thing is to build on that .
but we should n't just look at the mediterranean .
we also need to look to the east .
we have many new neighbors .
and that 's why it 's so important to have the right policies to engage with them . the eu is n't popular among its own citizens at the moment .
what can the commission do in real terms to make the mood a bit more pro-europe ? people have become used to the european union , and when something goes wrong at home , then they think europe is to blame , because national or regional politicians lay all the blame on europe .
and then of course it is difficult , when you have spent six days criticizing europe , to declare on the seventh day that europe has done something well . but take the financial crisis that has spread around the world .
if we did not have the eu , and if we did not have the euro , then all these states would be suffering badly from this crisis .
the union has shown it can maintain stability .
we should n't lose sight of very concrete things like that . a standard criticism you hear is that there 's too much bureaucracy , that the commission loves to centralize .
how do you respond ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is seen by many as a bureaucratic monster every day i meet politicians from member states and members of the european parliament who are always telling me " do this , do that . "
i 'm always being asked to do more .
you really have to put your foot down if you want to do less .
throughout my political career , i 've noticed that when you try to deregulate , you come in for a lot more criticism than when you create new rules . you 've come in for criticism in particular for wanting to set up an eu-wide regulatory body for the telecommunications market . we 're regulating in order to open up markets and introduce more competition .
once we have competition , we no longer need regulatory mechanisms , we can get rid of them .
so why do we need this regulatory authority ?
we have 27 national regulators who do n't always apply european law in a uniform way .
the european single market ca n't work like that .
so it 's vital that instead of having the commission regulating from the top down - we have a supervisory body which groups the 27 national regulators together so that they can regulate their markets in a way that makes sense for the whole of europe . you mean the eu body would have authority over the national bodies ? no , the 27 bodies would work together .
but they would no longer be against each other .
no more could one introduce measures that contradict what the neighbouring country does and which do n't allow our industry to draw on a pan-european market .
instead it 's about building this internal market , with its five hundred million people , attractive - not only for the consumer but also for europe-wide industries . those millions of people do n't all have the same access to media .
anyone wanting to watch dw-tv on the web , for example , needs broadband .
but that 's not available everywhere .
do you have a strategy for spreading broadband ? yes i do , in two ways .
first of all we want broadband for everyone in europe , including those who live in isolated areas .
and then we want european industry to have the opportunity to be involved in that investment .
so my goal is to modernize across the board - so that it 's no longer the select few who are out in front , but all 27 eu states together and everyone with access to a high-speed broadband service . interview : christian f trippe -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

because that which history divided , has now been re-united .
i think that with this we set an example for many nations . french president nicolas sarkozy says he wants to establish a mediterranean union ; sceptics say it could tear the eu apart .
are they right ? we already have a mediterranean union with the barcelona process , where the eu formed a solidarity pact with countries south of the mediterranean .
the right thing is to build on that .
but we should n't just look at the mediterranean .
we also need to look to the east .
we have many new neighbors .
and that 's why it 's so important to have the right policies to engage with them . the eu is n't popular among its own citizens at the moment .
what can the commission do in real terms to make the mood a bit more pro-europe ? people have become used to the european union , and when something goes wrong at home , then they think europe is to blame , because national or regional politicians lay all the blame on europe .
and then of course it is difficult , when you have spent six days criticizing europe , to declare on the seventh day that europe has done something well . but take the financial crisis that has spread around the world .
if we did not have the eu , and if we did not have the euro , then all these states would be suffering badly from this crisis .
the union has shown it can maintain stability .
we should n't lose sight of very concrete things like that . a standard criticism you hear is that there 's too much bureaucracy , that the commission loves to centralize .
how do you respond ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is seen by many as a bureaucratic monster every day i meet politicians from member states and members of the european parliament who are always telling me " do this , do that . "
i 'm always being asked to do more .
you really have to put your foot down if you want to do less .
throughout my political career , i 've noticed that when you try to deregulate , you come in for a lot more criticism than when you create new rules . you 've come in for criticism in particular for wanting to set up an eu-wide regulatory body for the telecommunications market . we 're regulating in order to open up markets and introduce more competition .
once we have competition , we no longer need regulatory mechanisms , we can get rid of them .
so why do we need this regulatory authority ?
we have 27 national regulators who do n't always apply european law in a uniform way .
the european single market ca n't work like that .
so it 's vital that instead of having the commission regulating from the top down - we have a supervisory body which groups the 27 national regulators together so that they can regulate their markets in a way that makes sense for the whole of europe . you mean the eu body would have authority over the national bodies ? no , the 27 bodies would work together .
but they would no longer be against each other .
no more could one introduce measures that contradict what the neighbouring country does and which do n't allow our industry to draw on a pan-european market .
instead it 's about building this internal market , with its five hundred million people , attractive - not only for the consumer but also for europe-wide industries . those millions of people do n't all have the same access to media .
anyone wanting to watch dw-tv on the web , for example , needs broadband .
but that 's not available everywhere .
do you have a strategy for spreading broadband ? yes i do , in two ways .
first of all we want broadband for everyone in europe , including those who live in isolated areas .
and then we want european industry to have the opportunity to be involved in that investment .
so my goal is to modernize across the board - so that it 's no longer the select few who are out in front , but all 27 eu states together and everyone with access to a high-speed broadband service . interview : christian f trippe -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that will only possible if europe speaks with one voice and if we have an internal market .
but for that , we need institutions to work effectively .
the ratification process has begun and will go on .
i 'm sure that a new eu will be fully functional from january next year . how will the treaty of lisbon change the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu made history with the signing of the lisbon treaty last december the institutions will become more effective .
the big winner is the european parliament .
it will have a very strong voice in all decisions .
and i think that 's a good thing , because the european parliament is the democratic institution on this continent .
directly-elected members will have a say in the future of european life and politics .
that is real democracy , and that 's a good thing . many people are talking about where the eu 's borders lie .
what 's your position - should turkey and ukraine be admitted ? that 's something we have to debate in a democratic way with those already inside europe .
but i would like to point out that this discussion has been going on for quite a long time already , and that there was a lot of criticism of past eu expansions - huge criticism of those countries that went from communism to democracy .
but it was the most wonderful reunification project you could imagine in world history .
it was the first time that such a large number of people moved into freedom and self-determination ; and that , not through war , but on a voluntary , democratic basis . all the same , there 's a feeling the eu may have bitten off more than it can chew .
people say it does n't matter if they meet the criteria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enthusiasm for further eu enlargement has waned since the last big round of expansion the ability to absorb new member states is important .
you have to remember that wealthier nations have let in nations that were less well-off .
but we also have to remember that the internal market has expanded greatly , and that was a big boost for an exporter like germany .
this expansion had many plus points , particularly the historical aspect .
because that which history divided , has now been re-united .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.02.2008 commissioner says reform treaty vital for eu 's survival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding said there 's a tendency to blame the eu for everything in an interview with dw-tv , viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media , spoke about the reform treaty as a force for change , enlargement and the tendency to blame brussels when things go wrong . dw-tv : the lisbon reform treaty has been signed but has yet to be ratified . could it still fail ? viviane reding : i do n't think so and i hope not as it would not be in the interest of the 500 million people of europe who want to live together peacefully and be a force in a globalized world .
that will only possible if europe speaks with one voice and if we have an internal market .
but for that , we need institutions to work effectively .
the ratification process has begun and will go on .
i 'm sure that a new eu will be fully functional from january next year . how will the treaty of lisbon change the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu made history with the signing of the lisbon treaty last december the institutions will become more effective .
the big winner is the european parliament .
it will have a very strong voice in all decisions .
and i think that 's a good thing , because the european parliament is the democratic institution on this continent .
directly-elected members will have a say in the future of european life and politics .
that is real democracy , and that 's a good thing . many people are talking about where the eu 's borders lie .
what 's your position - should turkey and ukraine be admitted ? that 's something we have to debate in a democratic way with those already inside europe .
but i would like to point out that this discussion has been going on for quite a long time already , and that there was a lot of criticism of past eu expansions - huge criticism of those countries that went from communism to democracy .
but it was the most wonderful reunification project you could imagine in world history .
it was the first time that such a large number of people moved into freedom and self-determination ; and that , not through war , but on a voluntary , democratic basis . all the same , there 's a feeling the eu may have bitten off more than it can chew .
people say it does n't matter if they meet the criteria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enthusiasm for further eu enlargement has waned since the last big round of expansion the ability to absorb new member states is important .
you have to remember that wealthier nations have let in nations that were less well-off .
but we also have to remember that the internal market has expanded greatly , and that was a big boost for an exporter like germany .
this expansion had many plus points , particularly the historical aspect .
because that which history divided , has now been re-united .
i think that with this we set an example for many nations . french president nicolas sarkozy says he wants to establish a mediterranean union ; sceptics say it could tear the eu apart .
are they right ? we already have a mediterranean union with the barcelona process , where the eu formed a solidarity pact with countries south of the mediterranean .
the right thing is to build on that .
but we should n't just look at the mediterranean .
we also need to look to the east .
we have many new neighbors .
and that 's why it 's so important to have the right policies to engage with them . the eu is n't popular among its own citizens at the moment .
what can the commission do in real terms to make the mood a bit more pro-europe ? people have become used to the european union , and when something goes wrong at home , then they think europe is to blame , because national or regional politicians lay all the blame on europe .
and then of course it is difficult , when you have spent six days criticizing europe , to declare on the seventh day that europe has done something well . but take the financial crisis that has spread around the world .
if we did not have the eu , and if we did not have the euro , then all these states would be suffering badly from this crisis .
the union has shown it can maintain stability .
we should n't lose sight of very concrete things like that . a standard criticism you hear is that there 's too much bureaucracy , that the commission loves to centralize .
how do you respond ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is seen by many as a bureaucratic monster every day i meet politicians from member states and members of the european parliament who are always telling me " do this , do that . "
i 'm always being asked to do more .
you really have to put your foot down if you want to do less .
throughout my political career , i 've noticed that when you try to deregulate , you come in for a lot more criticism than when you create new rules . you 've come in for criticism in particular for wanting to set up an eu-wide regulatory body for the telecommunications market . we 're regulating in order to open up markets and introduce more competition .
once we have competition , we no longer need regulatory mechanisms , we can get rid of them .
so why do we need this regulatory authority ?
we have 27 national regulators who do n't always apply european law in a uniform way .
the european single market ca n't work like that .
so it 's vital that instead of having the commission regulating from the top down - we have a supervisory body which groups the 27 national regulators together so that they can regulate their markets in a way that makes sense for the whole of europe . you mean the eu body would have authority over the national bodies ? no , the 27 bodies would work together .
but they would no longer be against each other .
no more could one introduce measures that contradict what the neighbouring country does and which do n't allow our industry to draw on a pan-european market .
instead it 's about building this internal market , with its five hundred million people , attractive - not only for the consumer but also for europe-wide industries . those millions of people do n't all have the same access to media .
anyone wanting to watch dw-tv on the web , for example , needs broadband .
but that 's not available everywhere .
do you have a strategy for spreading broadband ? yes i do , in two ways .
first of all we want broadband for everyone in europe , including those who live in isolated areas .
and then we want european industry to have the opportunity to be involved in that investment .
so my goal is to modernize across the board - so that it 's no longer the select few who are out in front , but all 27 eu states together and everyone with access to a high-speed broadband service . interview : christian f trippe -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.02.2008 commissioner says reform treaty vital for eu 's survival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding said there 's a tendency to blame the eu for everything in an interview with dw-tv , viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media , spoke about the reform treaty as a force for change , enlargement and the tendency to blame brussels when things go wrong . dw-tv : the lisbon reform treaty has been signed but has yet to be ratified . could it still fail ? viviane reding : i do n't think so and i hope not as it would not be in the interest of the 500 million people of europe who want to live together peacefully and be a force in a globalized world .
that will only possible if europe speaks with one voice and if we have an internal market .
but for that , we need institutions to work effectively .
the ratification process has begun and will go on .
i 'm sure that a new eu will be fully functional from january next year . how will the treaty of lisbon change the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu made history with the signing of the lisbon treaty last december the institutions will become more effective .
the big winner is the european parliament .
it will have a very strong voice in all decisions .
and i think that 's a good thing , because the european parliament is the democratic institution on this continent .
directly-elected members will have a say in the future of european life and politics .
that is real democracy , and that 's a good thing . many people are talking about where the eu 's borders lie .
what 's your position - should turkey and ukraine be admitted ? that 's something we have to debate in a democratic way with those already inside europe .
but i would like to point out that this discussion has been going on for quite a long time already , and that there was a lot of criticism of past eu expansions - huge criticism of those countries that went from communism to democracy .
but it was the most wonderful reunification project you could imagine in world history .
it was the first time that such a large number of people moved into freedom and self-determination ; and that , not through war , but on a voluntary , democratic basis . all the same , there 's a feeling the eu may have bitten off more than it can chew .
people say it does n't matter if they meet the criteria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enthusiasm for further eu enlargement has waned since the last big round of expansion the ability to absorb new member states is important .
you have to remember that wealthier nations have let in nations that were less well-off .
but we also have to remember that the internal market has expanded greatly , and that was a big boost for an exporter like germany .
this expansion had many plus points , particularly the historical aspect .
because that which history divided , has now been re-united .
i think that with this we set an example for many nations . french president nicolas sarkozy says he wants to establish a mediterranean union ; sceptics say it could tear the eu apart .
are they right ? we already have a mediterranean union with the barcelona process , where the eu formed a solidarity pact with countries south of the mediterranean .
the right thing is to build on that .
but we should n't just look at the mediterranean .
we also need to look to the east .
we have many new neighbors .
and that 's why it 's so important to have the right policies to engage with them . the eu is n't popular among its own citizens at the moment .
what can the commission do in real terms to make the mood a bit more pro-europe ? people have become used to the european union , and when something goes wrong at home , then they think europe is to blame , because national or regional politicians lay all the blame on europe .
and then of course it is difficult , when you have spent six days criticizing europe , to declare on the seventh day that europe has done something well . but take the financial crisis that has spread around the world .
if we did not have the eu , and if we did not have the euro , then all these states would be suffering badly from this crisis .
the union has shown it can maintain stability .
we should n't lose sight of very concrete things like that . a standard criticism you hear is that there 's too much bureaucracy , that the commission loves to centralize .
how do you respond ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is seen by many as a bureaucratic monster every day i meet politicians from member states and members of the european parliament who are always telling me " do this , do that . "
i 'm always being asked to do more .
you really have to put your foot down if you want to do less .
throughout my political career , i 've noticed that when you try to deregulate , you come in for a lot more criticism than when you create new rules . you 've come in for criticism in particular for wanting to set up an eu-wide regulatory body for the telecommunications market . we 're regulating in order to open up markets and introduce more competition .
once we have competition , we no longer need regulatory mechanisms , we can get rid of them .
so why do we need this regulatory authority ?
we have 27 national regulators who do n't always apply european law in a uniform way .
the european single market ca n't work like that .
so it 's vital that instead of having the commission regulating from the top down - we have a supervisory body which groups the 27 national regulators together so that they can regulate their markets in a way that makes sense for the whole of europe . you mean the eu body would have authority over the national bodies ? no , the 27 bodies would work together .
but they would no longer be against each other .
no more could one introduce measures that contradict what the neighbouring country does and which do n't allow our industry to draw on a pan-european market .
instead it 's about building this internal market , with its five hundred million people , attractive - not only for the consumer but also for europe-wide industries . those millions of people do n't all have the same access to media .
anyone wanting to watch dw-tv on the web , for example , needs broadband .
but that 's not available everywhere .
do you have a strategy for spreading broadband ? yes i do , in two ways .
first of all we want broadband for everyone in europe , including those who live in isolated areas .
and then we want european industry to have the opportunity to be involved in that investment .
so my goal is to modernize across the board - so that it 's no longer the select few who are out in front , but all 27 eu states together and everyone with access to a high-speed broadband service . interview : christian f trippe -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

people say it does n't matter if they meet the criteria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enthusiasm for further eu enlargement has waned since the last big round of expansion the ability to absorb new member states is important .
you have to remember that wealthier nations have let in nations that were less well-off .
but we also have to remember that the internal market has expanded greatly , and that was a big boost for an exporter like germany .
this expansion had many plus points , particularly the historical aspect .
because that which history divided , has now been re-united .
i think that with this we set an example for many nations . french president nicolas sarkozy says he wants to establish a mediterranean union ; sceptics say it could tear the eu apart .
are they right ? we already have a mediterranean union with the barcelona process , where the eu formed a solidarity pact with countries south of the mediterranean .
the right thing is to build on that .
but we should n't just look at the mediterranean .
we also need to look to the east .
we have many new neighbors .
and that 's why it 's so important to have the right policies to engage with them . the eu is n't popular among its own citizens at the moment .
what can the commission do in real terms to make the mood a bit more pro-europe ? people have become used to the european union , and when something goes wrong at home , then they think europe is to blame , because national or regional politicians lay all the blame on europe .
and then of course it is difficult , when you have spent six days criticizing europe , to declare on the seventh day that europe has done something well . but take the financial crisis that has spread around the world .
if we did not have the eu , and if we did not have the euro , then all these states would be suffering badly from this crisis .
the union has shown it can maintain stability .
we should n't lose sight of very concrete things like that . a standard criticism you hear is that there 's too much bureaucracy , that the commission loves to centralize .
how do you respond ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is seen by many as a bureaucratic monster every day i meet politicians from member states and members of the european parliament who are always telling me " do this , do that . "
i 'm always being asked to do more .
you really have to put your foot down if you want to do less .
throughout my political career , i 've noticed that when you try to deregulate , you come in for a lot more criticism than when you create new rules . you 've come in for criticism in particular for wanting to set up an eu-wide regulatory body for the telecommunications market . we 're regulating in order to open up markets and introduce more competition .
once we have competition , we no longer need regulatory mechanisms , we can get rid of them .
so why do we need this regulatory authority ?
we have 27 national regulators who do n't always apply european law in a uniform way .
the european single market ca n't work like that .
so it 's vital that instead of having the commission regulating from the top down - we have a supervisory body which groups the 27 national regulators together so that they can regulate their markets in a way that makes sense for the whole of europe . you mean the eu body would have authority over the national bodies ? no , the 27 bodies would work together .
but they would no longer be against each other .
no more could one introduce measures that contradict what the neighbouring country does and which do n't allow our industry to draw on a pan-european market .
instead it 's about building this internal market , with its five hundred million people , attractive - not only for the consumer but also for europe-wide industries . those millions of people do n't all have the same access to media .
anyone wanting to watch dw-tv on the web , for example , needs broadband .
but that 's not available everywhere .
do you have a strategy for spreading broadband ? yes i do , in two ways .
first of all we want broadband for everyone in europe , including those who live in isolated areas .
and then we want european industry to have the opportunity to be involved in that investment .

that will only possible if europe speaks with one voice and if we have an internal market .
but for that , we need institutions to work effectively .
the ratification process has begun and will go on .
i 'm sure that a new eu will be fully functional from january next year . how will the treaty of lisbon change the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu made history with the signing of the lisbon treaty last december the institutions will become more effective .
the big winner is the european parliament .
it will have a very strong voice in all decisions .
and i think that 's a good thing , because the european parliament is the democratic institution on this continent .
directly-elected members will have a say in the future of european life and politics .
that is real democracy , and that 's a good thing . many people are talking about where the eu 's borders lie .
what 's your position - should turkey and ukraine be admitted ? that 's something we have to debate in a democratic way with those already inside europe .
but i would like to point out that this discussion has been going on for quite a long time already , and that there was a lot of criticism of past eu expansions - huge criticism of those countries that went from communism to democracy .
but it was the most wonderful reunification project you could imagine in world history .
it was the first time that such a large number of people moved into freedom and self-determination ; and that , not through war , but on a voluntary , democratic basis . all the same , there 's a feeling the eu may have bitten off more than it can chew .

no more could one introduce measures that contradict what the neighbouring country does and which do n't allow our industry to draw on a pan-european market .
instead it 's about building this internal market , with its five hundred million people , attractive - not only for the consumer but also for europe-wide industries . those millions of people do n't all have the same access to media .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.02.2008 commissioner says reform treaty vital for eu 's survival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding said there 's a tendency to blame the eu for everything in an interview with dw-tv , viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media , spoke about the reform treaty as a force for change , enlargement and the tendency to blame brussels when things go wrong . dw-tv : the lisbon reform treaty has been signed but has yet to be ratified . could it still fail ? viviane reding : i do n't think so and i hope not as it would not be in the interest of the 500 million people of europe who want to live together peacefully and be a force in a globalized world .
that will only possible if europe speaks with one voice and if we have an internal market .
but for that , we need institutions to work effectively .
the ratification process has begun and will go on .
i 'm sure that a new eu will be fully functional from january next year . how will the treaty of lisbon change the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu made history with the signing of the lisbon treaty last december the institutions will become more effective .
the big winner is the european parliament .
it will have a very strong voice in all decisions .
and i think that 's a good thing , because the european parliament is the democratic institution on this continent .
directly-elected members will have a say in the future of european life and politics .
that is real democracy , and that 's a good thing . many people are talking about where the eu 's borders lie .
what 's your position - should turkey and ukraine be admitted ? that 's something we have to debate in a democratic way with those already inside europe .
but i would like to point out that this discussion has been going on for quite a long time already , and that there was a lot of criticism of past eu expansions - huge criticism of those countries that went from communism to democracy .
but it was the most wonderful reunification project you could imagine in world history .
it was the first time that such a large number of people moved into freedom and self-determination ; and that , not through war , but on a voluntary , democratic basis . all the same , there 's a feeling the eu may have bitten off more than it can chew .
people say it does n't matter if they meet the criteria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enthusiasm for further eu enlargement has waned since the last big round of expansion the ability to absorb new member states is important .
you have to remember that wealthier nations have let in nations that were less well-off .
but we also have to remember that the internal market has expanded greatly , and that was a big boost for an exporter like germany .
this expansion had many plus points , particularly the historical aspect .
because that which history divided , has now been re-united .
i think that with this we set an example for many nations . french president nicolas sarkozy says he wants to establish a mediterranean union ; sceptics say it could tear the eu apart .
are they right ? we already have a mediterranean union with the barcelona process , where the eu formed a solidarity pact with countries south of the mediterranean .
the right thing is to build on that .
but we should n't just look at the mediterranean .
we also need to look to the east .
we have many new neighbors .
and that 's why it 's so important to have the right policies to engage with them . the eu is n't popular among its own citizens at the moment .
what can the commission do in real terms to make the mood a bit more pro-europe ? people have become used to the european union , and when something goes wrong at home , then they think europe is to blame , because national or regional politicians lay all the blame on europe .
and then of course it is difficult , when you have spent six days criticizing europe , to declare on the seventh day that europe has done something well . but take the financial crisis that has spread around the world .
if we did not have the eu , and if we did not have the euro , then all these states would be suffering badly from this crisis .
the union has shown it can maintain stability .
we should n't lose sight of very concrete things like that . a standard criticism you hear is that there 's too much bureaucracy , that the commission loves to centralize .
how do you respond ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is seen by many as a bureaucratic monster every day i meet politicians from member states and members of the european parliament who are always telling me " do this , do that . "
i 'm always being asked to do more .
you really have to put your foot down if you want to do less .
throughout my political career , i 've noticed that when you try to deregulate , you come in for a lot more criticism than when you create new rules . you 've come in for criticism in particular for wanting to set up an eu-wide regulatory body for the telecommunications market . we 're regulating in order to open up markets and introduce more competition .
once we have competition , we no longer need regulatory mechanisms , we can get rid of them .
so why do we need this regulatory authority ?
we have 27 national regulators who do n't always apply european law in a uniform way .
the european single market ca n't work like that .
so it 's vital that instead of having the commission regulating from the top down - we have a supervisory body which groups the 27 national regulators together so that they can regulate their markets in a way that makes sense for the whole of europe . you mean the eu body would have authority over the national bodies ? no , the 27 bodies would work together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.02.2008 commissioner says reform treaty vital for eu 's survival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding said there 's a tendency to blame the eu for everything in an interview with dw-tv , viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media , spoke about the reform treaty as a force for change , enlargement and the tendency to blame brussels when things go wrong . dw-tv : the lisbon reform treaty has been signed but has yet to be ratified . could it still fail ? viviane reding : i do n't think so and i hope not as it would not be in the interest of the 500 million people of europe who want to live together peacefully and be a force in a globalized world .
that will only possible if europe speaks with one voice and if we have an internal market .
but for that , we need institutions to work effectively .
the ratification process has begun and will go on .
i 'm sure that a new eu will be fully functional from january next year . how will the treaty of lisbon change the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu made history with the signing of the lisbon treaty last december the institutions will become more effective .
the big winner is the european parliament .
it will have a very strong voice in all decisions .
and i think that 's a good thing , because the european parliament is the democratic institution on this continent .
directly-elected members will have a say in the future of european life and politics .
that is real democracy , and that 's a good thing . many people are talking about where the eu 's borders lie .
what 's your position - should turkey and ukraine be admitted ? that 's something we have to debate in a democratic way with those already inside europe .
but i would like to point out that this discussion has been going on for quite a long time already , and that there was a lot of criticism of past eu expansions - huge criticism of those countries that went from communism to democracy .
but it was the most wonderful reunification project you could imagine in world history .
it was the first time that such a large number of people moved into freedom and self-determination ; and that , not through war , but on a voluntary , democratic basis . all the same , there 's a feeling the eu may have bitten off more than it can chew .
people say it does n't matter if they meet the criteria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enthusiasm for further eu enlargement has waned since the last big round of expansion the ability to absorb new member states is important .
you have to remember that wealthier nations have let in nations that were less well-off .
but we also have to remember that the internal market has expanded greatly , and that was a big boost for an exporter like germany .
this expansion had many plus points , particularly the historical aspect .
because that which history divided , has now been re-united .
i think that with this we set an example for many nations . french president nicolas sarkozy says he wants to establish a mediterranean union ; sceptics say it could tear the eu apart .
are they right ? we already have a mediterranean union with the barcelona process , where the eu formed a solidarity pact with countries south of the mediterranean .
the right thing is to build on that .
but we should n't just look at the mediterranean .
we also need to look to the east .
we have many new neighbors .
and that 's why it 's so important to have the right policies to engage with them . the eu is n't popular among its own citizens at the moment .
what can the commission do in real terms to make the mood a bit more pro-europe ? people have become used to the european union , and when something goes wrong at home , then they think europe is to blame , because national or regional politicians lay all the blame on europe .
and then of course it is difficult , when you have spent six days criticizing europe , to declare on the seventh day that europe has done something well . but take the financial crisis that has spread around the world .
if we did not have the eu , and if we did not have the euro , then all these states would be suffering badly from this crisis .
the union has shown it can maintain stability .
we should n't lose sight of very concrete things like that . a standard criticism you hear is that there 's too much bureaucracy , that the commission loves to centralize .
how do you respond ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is seen by many as a bureaucratic monster every day i meet politicians from member states and members of the european parliament who are always telling me " do this , do that . "
i 'm always being asked to do more .
you really have to put your foot down if you want to do less .
throughout my political career , i 've noticed that when you try to deregulate , you come in for a lot more criticism than when you create new rules . you 've come in for criticism in particular for wanting to set up an eu-wide regulatory body for the telecommunications market . we 're regulating in order to open up markets and introduce more competition .
once we have competition , we no longer need regulatory mechanisms , we can get rid of them .
so why do we need this regulatory authority ?
we have 27 national regulators who do n't always apply european law in a uniform way .
the european single market ca n't work like that .
so it 's vital that instead of having the commission regulating from the top down - we have a supervisory body which groups the 27 national regulators together so that they can regulate their markets in a way that makes sense for the whole of europe . you mean the eu body would have authority over the national bodies ? no , the 27 bodies would work together .
but they would no longer be against each other .
no more could one introduce measures that contradict what the neighbouring country does and which do n't allow our industry to draw on a pan-european market .
instead it 's about building this internal market , with its five hundred million people , attractive - not only for the consumer but also for europe-wide industries . those millions of people do n't all have the same access to media .
anyone wanting to watch dw-tv on the web , for example , needs broadband .
but that 's not available everywhere .
do you have a strategy for spreading broadband ? yes i do , in two ways .
first of all we want broadband for everyone in europe , including those who live in isolated areas .
and then we want european industry to have the opportunity to be involved in that investment .
so my goal is to modernize across the board - so that it 's no longer the select few who are out in front , but all 27 eu states together and everyone with access to a high-speed broadband service . interview : christian f trippe -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

people say it does n't matter if they meet the criteria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enthusiasm for further eu enlargement has waned since the last big round of expansion the ability to absorb new member states is important .
you have to remember that wealthier nations have let in nations that were less well-off .
but we also have to remember that the internal market has expanded greatly , and that was a big boost for an exporter like germany .
this expansion had many plus points , particularly the historical aspect .
because that which history divided , has now been re-united .
i think that with this we set an example for many nations . french president nicolas sarkozy says he wants to establish a mediterranean union ; sceptics say it could tear the eu apart .
are they right ? we already have a mediterranean union with the barcelona process , where the eu formed a solidarity pact with countries south of the mediterranean .
the right thing is to build on that .
but we should n't just look at the mediterranean .
we also need to look to the east .
we have many new neighbors .
and that 's why it 's so important to have the right policies to engage with them . the eu is n't popular among its own citizens at the moment .
what can the commission do in real terms to make the mood a bit more pro-europe ? people have become used to the european union , and when something goes wrong at home , then they think europe is to blame , because national or regional politicians lay all the blame on europe .
and then of course it is difficult , when you have spent six days criticizing europe , to declare on the seventh day that europe has done something well . but take the financial crisis that has spread around the world .
if we did not have the eu , and if we did not have the euro , then all these states would be suffering badly from this crisis .
the union has shown it can maintain stability .
we should n't lose sight of very concrete things like that . a standard criticism you hear is that there 's too much bureaucracy , that the commission loves to centralize .
how do you respond ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is seen by many as a bureaucratic monster every day i meet politicians from member states and members of the european parliament who are always telling me " do this , do that . "
i 'm always being asked to do more .
you really have to put your foot down if you want to do less .
throughout my political career , i 've noticed that when you try to deregulate , you come in for a lot more criticism than when you create new rules . you 've come in for criticism in particular for wanting to set up an eu-wide regulatory body for the telecommunications market . we 're regulating in order to open up markets and introduce more competition .
once we have competition , we no longer need regulatory mechanisms , we can get rid of them .
so why do we need this regulatory authority ?
we have 27 national regulators who do n't always apply european law in a uniform way .
the european single market ca n't work like that .
so it 's vital that instead of having the commission regulating from the top down - we have a supervisory body which groups the 27 national regulators together so that they can regulate their markets in a way that makes sense for the whole of europe . you mean the eu body would have authority over the national bodies ? no , the 27 bodies would work together .
but they would no longer be against each other .
no more could one introduce measures that contradict what the neighbouring country does and which do n't allow our industry to draw on a pan-european market .
instead it 's about building this internal market , with its five hundred million people , attractive - not only for the consumer but also for europe-wide industries . those millions of people do n't all have the same access to media .
anyone wanting to watch dw-tv on the web , for example , needs broadband .
but that 's not available everywhere .
do you have a strategy for spreading broadband ? yes i do , in two ways .
first of all we want broadband for everyone in europe , including those who live in isolated areas .
and then we want european industry to have the opportunity to be involved in that investment .
so my goal is to modernize across the board - so that it 's no longer the select few who are out in front , but all 27 eu states together and everyone with access to a high-speed broadband service . interview : christian f trippe -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

michelle morris , from port talbot , can have up to 15 ' blackout ' seizures a day but is frustrated with the nhs .
her parents have taken out a loan to pay for private treatment after she had to wait nearly a year for an mri scan .
it comes after the assembly government said it would improve epilepsy care to ensure prompt diagnosis and treatement .
michelle , who was diagnosed with epilepsy last april , said she feels frustrated in finding the right medication and treatment to control her condition .
she is unable to be left alone because of the number of fits she has - some in which she blacks out for a few seconds and others where she collapses and has convulsions .
we are at our wits end and do n't know where to turn colin morris , father plans to improve epilepsy care her stepfather , adrian downs , has to take time off work to constantly watch her in case she collapses because her mother , stephanie , is disabled .
" i ca n't do much , i have to have someone with me constantly , " said michelle , who worked as a hotel receptionist before her diagnosis .
" i 've had to give up my job and studying , i ca n't go out with my friends , i ca n't go swimming .
it 's completely taken over my life . "
the assembly government has announced plans to introduce measures to help people to self-manage their condition and ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment .
michelle 's father , colin morris , from swansea , said help was urgently needed .
" we are at our wits end and do n't know where to turn , " he said .
i think epilepsy does n't get as much money and attention because it 's not such a ' fashionable ' illness stephanie downs , mother mr morris and his ex-wife have also paid for a mri scan because they said she had been waiting so long for one on the nhs .
they are now taking out loans for michelle to be seen by a professor in london .
" we 're getting mixed messages and it 's all very confusing , " said mr morris .
" i do n't expect miracles .
all i want is for someone to see michelle and give her the correct information about medication so she can manage her condition and live a more normal life .
" my daughter 's very depressed .
she 's crying constantly and she thinks she 's a burden on her family . "
her mother stephanie downs added : " my other daughter was diagnosed as diabetic and she had wonderful support .
" but i think epilepsy does n't get as much money and attention because it 's not such a fashionable illness .
it 's crazy . "
under the assembly government plans , each local health board would be required to develop a local action plan for epilepsy by september 2008 and ensure multi-disciplinary teams are in place by march 2009 .
the proposals will be put out to consultation until 2 may .

measures to reduce the incidence of epilepsy , help people to self-manage their condition and ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment are included .
the all-wales epilepsy forum said it hoped the plan would be implemented .
it also includes measures to provide more care closer to peoples ' homes , reducing hospital admissions .
well-managed medication procedures can help around 70 % of people with epilepsy to be seizure-free - thereby reducing the risk of emergency admission , said the assembly government .
under the plans , each local health board would be required to develop a local action plan for epilepsy by september 2008 and ensure multi-disciplinary teams are in place by march 2009 .
epilepsy epilepsy is the most common neurological condition in wales it is estimated between 20,000 - 30,000 people live with the condition 1,500 more people every year develop epilepsy around 1,000 people die every year in the uk because of epilepsy the chance of premature death is two or three times more likely for people living with epilepsy compared to the general population it aims to develop methods to ensure people with epilepsy are treated in the right place , at the right time and by the right person .
the plans were developed in partnership with the all-wales epilepsy forum and groups such as health and social care professionals with expertise in epilepsy .
consultant neurologist dr phillip smith said a more joined-up approach was needed to help patients with the condition .
he said : " epilepsy is not a single condition , it presents to different specialists , .
" so physicians , or care-of-the elderly physicians , neurologists , primary care doctors , paediatricians , will all be dealing with epilepsy and at the moment all in their own sector , without any joined-up thinking across wales .
" this -lsb- assembly plan -rsb- will , i think , help to integrate things much better . "
ms hart said the assembly government was committed to providing better services that were more patient-centred , integrated across health , social care and voluntary sector organisations and delivered closer to people 's homes .
" i am pleased that the welsh assembly government is leading the way in improving the care and treatment for people living with epilepsy , " she added .
welcoming the strategy , ann reynolds , chair of the all-wales epilepsy forum , said : " if the plans are implemented fully we believe they should lead to real improvements in epilepsy services and have a positive impact for people with epilepsy in wales . "
the proposals will be put out to consultation until 2 may .

measures to reduce the incidence of epilepsy , help people to self-manage their condition and ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment are included .
the all-wales epilepsy forum said it hoped the plan would be implemented .
it also includes measures to provide more care closer to peoples ' homes , reducing hospital admissions .
well-managed medication procedures can help around 70 % of people with epilepsy to be seizure-free - thereby reducing the risk of emergency admission , said the assembly government .
under the plans , each local health board would be required to develop a local action plan for epilepsy by september 2008 and ensure multi-disciplinary teams are in place by march 2009 .
epilepsy epilepsy is the most common neurological condition in wales it is estimated between 20,000 - 30,000 people live with the condition 1,500 more people every year develop epilepsy around 1,000 people die every year in the uk because of epilepsy the chance of premature death is two or three times more likely for people living with epilepsy compared to the general population it aims to develop methods to ensure people with epilepsy are treated in the right place , at the right time and by the right person .
the plans were developed in partnership with the all-wales epilepsy forum and groups such as health and social care professionals with expertise in epilepsy .
consultant neurologist dr phillip smith said a more joined-up approach was needed to help patients with the condition .
he said : " epilepsy is not a single condition , it presents to different specialists , .
" so physicians , or care-of-the elderly physicians , neurologists , primary care doctors , paediatricians , will all be dealing with epilepsy and at the moment all in their own sector , without any joined-up thinking across wales .
" this -lsb- assembly plan -rsb- will , i think , help to integrate things much better . "
ms hart said the assembly government was committed to providing better services that were more patient-centred , integrated across health , social care and voluntary sector organisations and delivered closer to people 's homes .
" i am pleased that the welsh assembly government is leading the way in improving the care and treatment for people living with epilepsy , " she added .
welcoming the strategy , ann reynolds , chair of the all-wales epilepsy forum , said : " if the plans are implemented fully we believe they should lead to real improvements in epilepsy services and have a positive impact for people with epilepsy in wales . "

storage buildings for the market and the hawley arms pub were severely damaged , but no injuries were reported .
some 100 firefighters tackled the blaze , which began about 1920 gmt , and some are continuing to dampen down hotspots .
although camden council set up an emergency shelter in a sports hall with 100 beds available , only six people , including three children , spent the night there after their homes were evacuated .
about 20 others were given accommodation at hotels .
a scotland yard spokesman said : " chalk farm road and parts of camden high street , as well as surrounding one-way streets , are expected to be closed for the next three or four days . "
it 's very sad .
it 's a well-known party area billy reeves eyewitness accounts of blaze the closures are to allow structural engineers to assess the damage to buildings , including the hawley arms , a popular camden pub which is frequented by celebrities including singer amy winehouse .
landlady ruth charles-ridler said she was " devastated " .
" everyone i 've spoken to is in complete shock . "
the markets area is a major tourist attraction attracting up to 300,000 visitors each weekend to its six open-air and indoor markets and vibrant mix of bars , clubs , shops and restaurants .
london fire brigade station manager guy foster said there were no reports of any casualties , injuries or rescues .
" when firefighters arrived they found an intense fire and they have done incredibly well to get it under control so quickly .
" the decision was taken to clear a large area around the fire because we believed there were propane gas canisters in some of the market stalls .
" the police had to carry out a large operation to clear what is a very busy area on a saturday night and they have done an excellent job to enable us to fight the fire effectively . "
residents had also been evacuated from some houses and flats .
a spokeswoman for camden council said it would keep open a rest centre for evacuees at talacre sports centre " as long as it is needed " .
evacuees are being advised to call the council 's emergency line on 0207 974 4444 for the latest information on rehousing .
train services suspended camden council is also organising a meeting to help businesses affected by the fire on sunday but have yet to confirm a time .
details will be posted on the council 's website .
the meeting will be to provide advice , such as insurance and re-opening plans , to damaged businesses as well as those undamaged but within the cordon which remain closed , a spokeswoman said .

network rail said it would check if any damage was caused to the tracks by the fire .
ken livingstone , mayor of london , said : " our thoughts are with those people affected by the fire in camden market - one of the most thriving markets in london and of enormous importance for the economy of the local area and beyond . "
conservative mayoral candidate boris johnson said : " this will come as a terrible blow to their livelihoods and the area generally .
my thoughts are with the traders , local residents and the emergency services who are , as usual , performing brilliantly under pressure . "

democracy live last updated : sunday , 10 february 2008 , 10:12 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version brown now ' firmly in the saddle ' on sunday 10 february andrew marr interviewed peter mandelson , eu trade commissioner he is ' getting on top of what it takes to be prime minister ' , says peter mandelson .
peter mandelson , eu trade commissioner andrew marr : welcome , thank you for ..
peter mandelson : good morning .
andrew marr : good morning .
thank you for coming in .
it is a dangerous moment for the world economy is n't it ?
peter mandelson : yes we have started two thousand and eight in a rather grim mood .
there is nervousness and some fear about the course the global economy will take this year .
there is a threat of recession hanging over us .
but the point i was making in my lecture in cambridge on friday was that the very worst response we could make to that would be to try to withdraw , to shelter ourselves from the global economy , to sort of hang on to what we have .
if we started reducing trade the down side of the economy this year would be far , far worse than it would otherwise be .
andrew marr : you 've talked about an openness boom around the world .
peter mandelson : yeah .
andrew marr : but protectionism is a serious possibility , serious threat , as things ..
peter mandelson : yeah .
andrew marr : .. turn down .
peter mandelson : well we have been , and we are , living in an openness boom .
i spend as much time living in the world in my job as i do in brussels .
and i see just how integrated all our economies have become and how inter-dependent they are .
now the driver of globalisation or one of the principal drivers of globalisation , along with technology , is trade .
growing trade has brought us rising prosperity , living standards for us in the developed world but also amongst developing countries .
now we have to look to politicians , to national and international leaders to explain why that openness boom is important to maintain .
there are fears .
there , there is , there are real insecurities associated with it .
but that 's why we need a , as it were , a better globalisation , a better policy mix to sustain globalisation .
we 're not better off without globalisation .
andrew marr : are you a bit concerned about the tone in america at the moment , during this presidential - it 's been pretty anti-free trade actually .
peter mandelson : it has been , not amongst all the candidates .
i mean on , on the democrat side the most anti free trade candidate , john edwards has bombed out ¿ andrew marr : gone .
peter mandelson : .. of the race .
and of course on the republican side the most pro free trade candidate john mccain is leading and probably going to be the candidate for the republicans .
so that 's good news .
on the other hand ..
andrew marr : hillary and barack ..
peter mandelson : well barack less so than hilary clinton .
i mean hillary , you know she 's a very tried , tested , tough , robust politician .
and i would have , i would have put her into the sort of clintonite sort of free trade camp .
but now she 's started to question the very principles on which free trade takes place .
she 's said that she would take time out from future trade agreements and has even put a question mark over the world trade round .
now this is not what i would have expected from her ..
andrew marr : would you ..
peter mandelson : .. because , because she 's more an iso .. more an internationalist ..
andrew marr : yeah .
peter mandelson : .. than an isolationist .
andrew marr : would you prefer to see mccain in the white house therefore ?
peter mandelson : well if i had a vote i 'd be voting for the democrats .
andrew marr : right .
peter mandelson : whoever is the candidate .
andrew marr : i see .
peter mandelson : but i have to say about john mccain , he is a multilateralist .
obviously he would pursue a foreign policy that was rooted very much in america 's national interest , as you would expect from any president .
but he 's also , he 's also a , quite a straight talking , tough politician who is prepared to say things which are unpopular and i think that 's what makes him attractive .
andrew marr : let me ask you about tony blair because there 's an interesting debate as to whether he would be the right kind of candidate to become president of the council , assuming all the treaty goes through and so forth in the various bits , because some people say on the one hand too close to the americans over iraq , britain 's not in the euro , he 's not the right person .
on the other hand you talked in your lecture about europe wanting to project herself onto the world stage .
would you like to see him run for it ?
peter mandelson : well i certainly want to see a europe that projects its interests and values more effectively in the world .
i 'm a , in that sense i 'm a projectionist , not a protectionist pro european .
but i think in this particular job , which in my view would play a necessary role in making a europe more effective on the global stage , i would like to see it filled by somebody , you know , who would approach the job in that way .
but you know we are months and months and months , way too premature to start talking about individuals .
i know president sarkozy has put mr blair 's name out there .
but i think there 's a lot of discussion to take place first amongst european heads of government about precisely how they want to see that role fulfilled and therefore who would be most suitable to do the job .
and that conversation ..
andrew marr : has n't started .
peter mandelson : .. simply has not even started .
we have n't even got a treaty that 's ratified .
andrew marr : yeah .
and yet at a personal level presumably you 'd quite like to see him there would n't you ?
peter mandelson : well what 's more important is how other , you know , how european heads of government want to see that job being done .
and i think there 's going to be quite a debate about that .
i think there will be some ..
andrew marr : i thought you 'd just say absolutely , of course i 'd like to see him there .
i 'm interested that you know ..
peter mandelson : well ..
andrew marr : .. you 're not quite so ..
peter mandelson : look what i see him doing is fulfilling a role in the middle east which is very important to him .
he 's preparing for the launch of his faith , faith foundation .
he 's spending enjoyably much more time with his family .
i mean i , personally i want him to be happy doing what he 's doing .
andrew marr : right .
peter mandelson : now i ca n't speak for him and say what would bring him the greatest happiness or the greatest professional reward .
all i see is a man who is extremely focused on what he 's doing in the middle east and who 's terribly committed to preparing this faith foundation .
and , and i think it would be a difficult judgment for him as to , as to whether he suddenly made a , yet , you know another quite big change in his life , having started what he 's doing this year and since he left number ten .
andrew marr : what do you say to all of those people - and there 's a lot of them out there - who feel , from what they 've about the treaty and the constitution , they really are in effect the same thing and that the country 's being bilked of a referendum that was promised ?
peter mandelson : look the , the former constitutional treaty had all the trappings and tassels and thrills and consequences of , what to all intents and purposes was a constitution .
this treaty , a reform treaty has , does not have those constitutional implications .
what it 's about , in a rather more modest way , is to make the european union work more efficiently , to give it a more effective impact in the rest of the world .
and that , andrew , is needed .
you know europe per europe punches below its weight at the moment in the world .
we have strong interests .
we have very powerful values .
people in the rest of the world look to europe to give a lead because of what we stand for and because of what we put into the rest of the world .
but we 're not doing it as effectively and efficiently as we could and should be doing .
andrew marr : rather than the trappings and so forth would it help if britain joined the euro ?
peter mandelson : in what sense would it help ?
would it help europe ?
andrew marr : yes .
peter mandelson : i believe that ..
andrew marr : and britain of course , but i mean ..
peter mandelson : i , i personally think that our future , economic future will be more secure in the euro zone with that currency .
but i 've always accepted that the economic conditions have to be right .
andrew marr : and no chance really of gordon brown launching that at this moment i would have thought ?
peter mandelson : i do n't think there 's any early prospect .
andrew marr : right .
okay .
speaking of which what do you make of - i mean it 's been another rough few months .
charles clarke in the daily mail yesterday launched a pretty ferocious attack on the prime minister saying that he was basically a coward , he was dithering , he could n't take decisions , he did n't trust people .
peter mandelson : daily mail is not my newspaper of choice on a saturday morning so i did n't read ..
andrew marr : charles clarke 's an old mucker of yours .
peter mandelson : he is indeed an old mucker and he 's a good and senior politician .
i mean i do n't know what he said , i do n't know whether he was accurately reported .
andrew marr : so what do you think about gordon brown at the moment ?
peter mandelson : what i would - well , let me say what i 've said first of all about charles clarke .
i think he 's a very able politician who probably belongs sort of in the government rather than outside it and ..
andrew marr : i do n't think that was a way of getting in ..
peter mandelson : .. and , and ..
andrew marr : .. to any government i 've seen .
peter mandelson : and i suspect that was as much a cry of frustration as it , as it is anything else .
on the government , look the immediate transition from tony blair to gordon brown was handled really well .
i mean they both played their part in passing the baton from one to the other .
and it was a good transition from two individuals , from one generation of the cabinet to another .
and indeed i hope from one version of new labour to the other .
now they did n't have a brilliant run in the autumn .
i think they 've come back since the new year sort of having ..
peter mandelson : .. as it were looked at themselves in the face or in the mirror and said right we 've got to do things sort of slightly differently .
andrew marr : and do you think gordon brown is a thoroughly new labour as you would understand it ?
peter mandelson : and i think , and i think that 's what you 're seeing .
i think - look , i think during the autumn you would have been forgiven for wondering whether this was going to be you know a transition from one version of new labour to another .
i think that in what the prime minister has said since january , his interventions , his speeches and also what he 's paving the way to say and do during this year is a strong indicator of a man who has found his bearings , who has his sort of political compass now firmly in his grasp and is getting on top of what it takes to be prime minister .
that is not ...
andrew marr : and yet ¿ peter mandelson : .. that is , you know it 's a hard adjustment to make .
andrew marr : sure .
sure .
peter mandelson : and it has taken few months and i think he 's now very firmly in the saddle , in his stride and i think he 'll see the consequences of that for the government 's performance during this year .
andrew marr : but the other person who 's clearly in the saddle and in his stride is david cameron who i know you saw at davos .
he 's ..
peter mandelson : i ...
andrew marr : ... purely professionally he 's doing very well is n't he ?
as one professional looking at another ?
peter mandelson : well you know he 's not michael howard or william hague or iain duncan smith is he ?
andrew marr : no .
peter mandelson : i mean you know , i mean so enough said .
but i mean , i mean whether he has what it takes to be prime minister , what the depth of the man is , whether he has a really strong policy sense , i do n't know .
but he could not be doing any worse , could he , than his predecessors ?
andrew marr : indeed .
on that note peter mandelson for now thank you very much indeed for coming in .

democracy live last updated : sunday , 10 february 2008 , 10:12 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version brown now ' firmly in the saddle ' on sunday 10 february andrew marr interviewed peter mandelson , eu trade commissioner he is ' getting on top of what it takes to be prime minister ' , says peter mandelson .
peter mandelson , eu trade commissioner andrew marr : welcome , thank you for ..
peter mandelson : good morning .
andrew marr : good morning .
thank you for coming in .
it is a dangerous moment for the world economy is n't it ?
peter mandelson : yes we have started two thousand and eight in a rather grim mood .
there is nervousness and some fear about the course the global economy will take this year .
there is a threat of recession hanging over us .
but the point i was making in my lecture in cambridge on friday was that the very worst response we could make to that would be to try to withdraw , to shelter ourselves from the global economy , to sort of hang on to what we have .
if we started reducing trade the down side of the economy this year would be far , far worse than it would otherwise be .
andrew marr : you 've talked about an openness boom around the world .
peter mandelson : yeah .
andrew marr : but protectionism is a serious possibility , serious threat , as things ..
peter mandelson : yeah .
andrew marr : .. turn down .
peter mandelson : well we have been , and we are , living in an openness boom .
i spend as much time living in the world in my job as i do in brussels .
and i see just how integrated all our economies have become and how inter-dependent they are .
now the driver of globalisation or one of the principal drivers of globalisation , along with technology , is trade .
growing trade has brought us rising prosperity , living standards for us in the developed world but also amongst developing countries .
now we have to look to politicians , to national and international leaders to explain why that openness boom is important to maintain .
there are fears .
there , there is , there are real insecurities associated with it .
but that 's why we need a , as it were , a better globalisation , a better policy mix to sustain globalisation .
we 're not better off without globalisation .
andrew marr : are you a bit concerned about the tone in america at the moment , during this presidential - it 's been pretty anti-free trade actually .
peter mandelson : it has been , not amongst all the candidates .
i mean on , on the democrat side the most anti free trade candidate , john edwards has bombed out ¿ andrew marr : gone .
peter mandelson : .. of the race .
and of course on the republican side the most pro free trade candidate john mccain is leading and probably going to be the candidate for the republicans .
so that 's good news .
on the other hand ..
andrew marr : hillary and barack ..
peter mandelson : well barack less so than hilary clinton .
i mean hillary , you know she 's a very tried , tested , tough , robust politician .
and i would have , i would have put her into the sort of clintonite sort of free trade camp .
but now she 's started to question the very principles on which free trade takes place .
she 's said that she would take time out from future trade agreements and has even put a question mark over the world trade round .
now this is not what i would have expected from her ..
andrew marr : would you ..
peter mandelson : .. because , because she 's more an iso .. more an internationalist ..
andrew marr : yeah .
peter mandelson : .. than an isolationist .
andrew marr : would you prefer to see mccain in the white house therefore ?
peter mandelson : well if i had a vote i 'd be voting for the democrats .
andrew marr : right .
peter mandelson : whoever is the candidate .
andrew marr : i see .
peter mandelson : but i have to say about john mccain , he is a multilateralist .
obviously he would pursue a foreign policy that was rooted very much in america 's national interest , as you would expect from any president .
but he 's also , he 's also a , quite a straight talking , tough politician who is prepared to say things which are unpopular and i think that 's what makes him attractive .
andrew marr : let me ask you about tony blair because there 's an interesting debate as to whether he would be the right kind of candidate to become president of the council , assuming all the treaty goes through and so forth in the various bits , because some people say on the one hand too close to the americans over iraq , britain 's not in the euro , he 's not the right person .
on the other hand you talked in your lecture about europe wanting to project herself onto the world stage .
would you like to see him run for it ?
peter mandelson : well i certainly want to see a europe that projects its interests and values more effectively in the world .
i 'm a , in that sense i 'm a projectionist , not a protectionist pro european .
but i think in this particular job , which in my view would play a necessary role in making a europe more effective on the global stage , i would like to see it filled by somebody , you know , who would approach the job in that way .
but you know we are months and months and months , way too premature to start talking about individuals .
i know president sarkozy has put mr blair 's name out there .
but i think there 's a lot of discussion to take place first amongst european heads of government about precisely how they want to see that role fulfilled and therefore who would be most suitable to do the job .
and that conversation ..
andrew marr : has n't started .
peter mandelson : .. simply has not even started .
we have n't even got a treaty that 's ratified .
andrew marr : yeah .
and yet at a personal level presumably you 'd quite like to see him there would n't you ?
peter mandelson : well what 's more important is how other , you know , how european heads of government want to see that job being done .
and i think there 's going to be quite a debate about that .
i think there will be some ..
andrew marr : i thought you 'd just say absolutely , of course i 'd like to see him there .
i 'm interested that you know ..
peter mandelson : well ..
andrew marr : .. you 're not quite so ..
peter mandelson : look what i see him doing is fulfilling a role in the middle east which is very important to him .
he 's preparing for the launch of his faith , faith foundation .
he 's spending enjoyably much more time with his family .
i mean i , personally i want him to be happy doing what he 's doing .
andrew marr : right .
peter mandelson : now i ca n't speak for him and say what would bring him the greatest happiness or the greatest professional reward .
all i see is a man who is extremely focused on what he 's doing in the middle east and who 's terribly committed to preparing this faith foundation .
and , and i think it would be a difficult judgment for him as to , as to whether he suddenly made a , yet , you know another quite big change in his life , having started what he 's doing this year and since he left number ten .
andrew marr : what do you say to all of those people - and there 's a lot of them out there - who feel , from what they 've about the treaty and the constitution , they really are in effect the same thing and that the country 's being bilked of a referendum that was promised ?
peter mandelson : look the , the former constitutional treaty had all the trappings and tassels and thrills and consequences of , what to all intents and purposes was a constitution .
this treaty , a reform treaty has , does not have those constitutional implications .
what it 's about , in a rather more modest way , is to make the european union work more efficiently , to give it a more effective impact in the rest of the world .
and that , andrew , is needed .
you know europe per europe punches below its weight at the moment in the world .
we have strong interests .
we have very powerful values .
people in the rest of the world look to europe to give a lead because of what we stand for and because of what we put into the rest of the world .
but we 're not doing it as effectively and efficiently as we could and should be doing .
andrew marr : rather than the trappings and so forth would it help if britain joined the euro ?
peter mandelson : in what sense would it help ?
would it help europe ?
andrew marr : yes .
peter mandelson : i believe that ..
andrew marr : and britain of course , but i mean ..
peter mandelson : i , i personally think that our future , economic future will be more secure in the euro zone with that currency .
but i 've always accepted that the economic conditions have to be right .
andrew marr : and no chance really of gordon brown launching that at this moment i would have thought ?
peter mandelson : i do n't think there 's any early prospect .
andrew marr : right .
okay .
speaking of which what do you make of - i mean it 's been another rough few months .

democracy live last updated : sunday , 10 february 2008 , 10:12 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version brown now ' firmly in the saddle ' on sunday 10 february andrew marr interviewed peter mandelson , eu trade commissioner he is ' getting on top of what it takes to be prime minister ' , says peter mandelson .
peter mandelson , eu trade commissioner andrew marr : welcome , thank you for ..
peter mandelson : good morning .
andrew marr : good morning .
thank you for coming in .
it is a dangerous moment for the world economy is n't it ?
peter mandelson : yes we have started two thousand and eight in a rather grim mood .
there is nervousness and some fear about the course the global economy will take this year .
there is a threat of recession hanging over us .
but the point i was making in my lecture in cambridge on friday was that the very worst response we could make to that would be to try to withdraw , to shelter ourselves from the global economy , to sort of hang on to what we have .
if we started reducing trade the down side of the economy this year would be far , far worse than it would otherwise be .
andrew marr : you 've talked about an openness boom around the world .
peter mandelson : yeah .
andrew marr : but protectionism is a serious possibility , serious threat , as things ..
peter mandelson : yeah .
andrew marr : .. turn down .
peter mandelson : well we have been , and we are , living in an openness boom .
i spend as much time living in the world in my job as i do in brussels .
and i see just how integrated all our economies have become and how inter-dependent they are .
now the driver of globalisation or one of the principal drivers of globalisation , along with technology , is trade .
growing trade has brought us rising prosperity , living standards for us in the developed world but also amongst developing countries .
now we have to look to politicians , to national and international leaders to explain why that openness boom is important to maintain .
there are fears .
there , there is , there are real insecurities associated with it .
but that 's why we need a , as it were , a better globalisation , a better policy mix to sustain globalisation .
we 're not better off without globalisation .
andrew marr : are you a bit concerned about the tone in america at the moment , during this presidential - it 's been pretty anti-free trade actually .
peter mandelson : it has been , not amongst all the candidates .
i mean on , on the democrat side the most anti free trade candidate , john edwards has bombed out ¿ andrew marr : gone .
peter mandelson : .. of the race .
and of course on the republican side the most pro free trade candidate john mccain is leading and probably going to be the candidate for the republicans .
so that 's good news .
on the other hand ..
andrew marr : hillary and barack ..
peter mandelson : well barack less so than hilary clinton .
i mean hillary , you know she 's a very tried , tested , tough , robust politician .
and i would have , i would have put her into the sort of clintonite sort of free trade camp .
but now she 's started to question the very principles on which free trade takes place .
she 's said that she would take time out from future trade agreements and has even put a question mark over the world trade round .
now this is not what i would have expected from her ..
andrew marr : would you ..
peter mandelson : .. because , because she 's more an iso .. more an internationalist ..
andrew marr : yeah .
peter mandelson : .. than an isolationist .
andrew marr : would you prefer to see mccain in the white house therefore ?
peter mandelson : well if i had a vote i 'd be voting for the democrats .
andrew marr : right .
peter mandelson : whoever is the candidate .
andrew marr : i see .
peter mandelson : but i have to say about john mccain , he is a multilateralist .
obviously he would pursue a foreign policy that was rooted very much in america 's national interest , as you would expect from any president .
but he 's also , he 's also a , quite a straight talking , tough politician who is prepared to say things which are unpopular and i think that 's what makes him attractive .
andrew marr : let me ask you about tony blair because there 's an interesting debate as to whether he would be the right kind of candidate to become president of the council , assuming all the treaty goes through and so forth in the various bits , because some people say on the one hand too close to the americans over iraq , britain 's not in the euro , he 's not the right person .
on the other hand you talked in your lecture about europe wanting to project herself onto the world stage .
would you like to see him run for it ?
peter mandelson : well i certainly want to see a europe that projects its interests and values more effectively in the world .
i 'm a , in that sense i 'm a projectionist , not a protectionist pro european .
but i think in this particular job , which in my view would play a necessary role in making a europe more effective on the global stage , i would like to see it filled by somebody , you know , who would approach the job in that way .
but you know we are months and months and months , way too premature to start talking about individuals .
i know president sarkozy has put mr blair 's name out there .
but i think there 's a lot of discussion to take place first amongst european heads of government about precisely how they want to see that role fulfilled and therefore who would be most suitable to do the job .
and that conversation ..
andrew marr : has n't started .
peter mandelson : .. simply has not even started .
we have n't even got a treaty that 's ratified .
andrew marr : yeah .
and yet at a personal level presumably you 'd quite like to see him there would n't you ?
peter mandelson : well what 's more important is how other , you know , how european heads of government want to see that job being done .
and i think there 's going to be quite a debate about that .
i think there will be some ..
andrew marr : i thought you 'd just say absolutely , of course i 'd like to see him there .
i 'm interested that you know ..
peter mandelson : well ..
andrew marr : .. you 're not quite so ..
peter mandelson : look what i see him doing is fulfilling a role in the middle east which is very important to him .
he 's preparing for the launch of his faith , faith foundation .
he 's spending enjoyably much more time with his family .
i mean i , personally i want him to be happy doing what he 's doing .
andrew marr : right .
peter mandelson : now i ca n't speak for him and say what would bring him the greatest happiness or the greatest professional reward .
all i see is a man who is extremely focused on what he 's doing in the middle east and who 's terribly committed to preparing this faith foundation .
and , and i think it would be a difficult judgment for him as to , as to whether he suddenly made a , yet , you know another quite big change in his life , having started what he 's doing this year and since he left number ten .
andrew marr : what do you say to all of those people - and there 's a lot of them out there - who feel , from what they 've about the treaty and the constitution , they really are in effect the same thing and that the country 's being bilked of a referendum that was promised ?
peter mandelson : look the , the former constitutional treaty had all the trappings and tassels and thrills and consequences of , what to all intents and purposes was a constitution .
this treaty , a reform treaty has , does not have those constitutional implications .
what it 's about , in a rather more modest way , is to make the european union work more efficiently , to give it a more effective impact in the rest of the world .
and that , andrew , is needed .
you know europe per europe punches below its weight at the moment in the world .
we have strong interests .
we have very powerful values .
people in the rest of the world look to europe to give a lead because of what we stand for and because of what we put into the rest of the world .
but we 're not doing it as effectively and efficiently as we could and should be doing .
andrew marr : rather than the trappings and so forth would it help if britain joined the euro ?
peter mandelson : in what sense would it help ?
would it help europe ?
andrew marr : yes .
peter mandelson : i believe that ..
andrew marr : and britain of course , but i mean ..
peter mandelson : i , i personally think that our future , economic future will be more secure in the euro zone with that currency .
but i 've always accepted that the economic conditions have to be right .
andrew marr : and no chance really of gordon brown launching that at this moment i would have thought ?
peter mandelson : i do n't think there 's any early prospect .
andrew marr : right .
okay .
speaking of which what do you make of - i mean it 's been another rough few months .
charles clarke in the daily mail yesterday launched a pretty ferocious attack on the prime minister saying that he was basically a coward , he was dithering , he could n't take decisions , he did n't trust people .
peter mandelson : daily mail is not my newspaper of choice on a saturday morning so i did n't read ..
andrew marr : charles clarke 's an old mucker of yours .
peter mandelson : he is indeed an old mucker and he 's a good and senior politician .
i mean i do n't know what he said , i do n't know whether he was accurately reported .
andrew marr : so what do you think about gordon brown at the moment ?
peter mandelson : what i would - well , let me say what i 've said first of all about charles clarke .
i think he 's a very able politician who probably belongs sort of in the government rather than outside it and ..
andrew marr : i do n't think that was a way of getting in ..
peter mandelson : .. and , and ..
andrew marr : .. to any government i 've seen .
peter mandelson : and i suspect that was as much a cry of frustration as it , as it is anything else .
on the government , look the immediate transition from tony blair to gordon brown was handled really well .
i mean they both played their part in passing the baton from one to the other .
and it was a good transition from two individuals , from one generation of the cabinet to another .
and indeed i hope from one version of new labour to the other .
now they did n't have a brilliant run in the autumn .
i think they 've come back since the new year sort of having ..
peter mandelson : .. as it were looked at themselves in the face or in the mirror and said right we 've got to do things sort of slightly differently .
andrew marr : and do you think gordon brown is a thoroughly new labour as you would understand it ?
peter mandelson : and i think , and i think that 's what you 're seeing .
i think - look , i think during the autumn you would have been forgiven for wondering whether this was going to be you know a transition from one version of new labour to another .
i think that in what the prime minister has said since january , his interventions , his speeches and also what he 's paving the way to say and do during this year is a strong indicator of a man who has found his bearings , who has his sort of political compass now firmly in his grasp and is getting on top of what it takes to be prime minister .
that is not ...
andrew marr : and yet ¿ peter mandelson : .. that is , you know it 's a hard adjustment to make .
andrew marr : sure .
sure .
peter mandelson : and it has taken few months and i think he 's now very firmly in the saddle , in his stride and i think he 'll see the consequences of that for the government 's performance during this year .
andrew marr : but the other person who 's clearly in the saddle and in his stride is david cameron who i know you saw at davos .
he 's ..
peter mandelson : i ...
andrew marr : ... purely professionally he 's doing very well is n't he ?
as one professional looking at another ?
peter mandelson : well you know he 's not michael howard or william hague or iain duncan smith is he ?
andrew marr : no .
peter mandelson : i mean you know , i mean so enough said .
but i mean , i mean whether he has what it takes to be prime minister , what the depth of the man is , whether he has a really strong policy sense , i do n't know .
but he could not be doing any worse , could he , than his predecessors ?
andrew marr : indeed .
on that note peter mandelson for now thank you very much indeed for coming in .

it is a dangerous moment for the world economy is n't it ?

andrew marr : are you a bit concerned about the tone in america at the moment , during this presidential - it 's been pretty anti-free trade actually .
peter mandelson : it has been , not amongst all the candidates .
i mean on , on the democrat side the most anti free trade candidate , john edwards has bombed out ¿ andrew marr : gone .
peter mandelson : .. of the race .
and of course on the republican side the most pro free trade candidate john mccain is leading and probably going to be the candidate for the republicans .
so that 's good news .
on the other hand ..
andrew marr : hillary and barack ..
peter mandelson : well barack less so than hilary clinton .
i mean hillary , you know she 's a very tried , tested , tough , robust politician .
and i would have , i would have put her into the sort of clintonite sort of free trade camp .
but now she 's started to question the very principles on which free trade takes place .
she 's said that she would take time out from future trade agreements and has even put a question mark over the world trade round .
now this is not what i would have expected from her ..
andrew marr : would you ..
peter mandelson : .. because , because she 's more an iso .. more an internationalist ..
andrew marr : yeah .
peter mandelson : .. than an isolationist .
andrew marr : would you prefer to see mccain in the white house therefore ?
peter mandelson : well if i had a vote i 'd be voting for the democrats .
andrew marr : right .
peter mandelson : whoever is the candidate .
andrew marr : i see .
peter mandelson : but i have to say about john mccain , he is a multilateralist .
obviously he would pursue a foreign policy that was rooted very much in america 's national interest , as you would expect from any president .
but he 's also , he 's also a , quite a straight talking , tough politician who is prepared to say things which are unpopular and i think that 's what makes him attractive .
andrew marr : let me ask you about tony blair because there 's an interesting debate as to whether he would be the right kind of candidate to become president of the council , assuming all the treaty goes through and so forth in the various bits , because some people say on the one hand too close to the americans over iraq , britain 's not in the euro , he 's not the right person .
on the other hand you talked in your lecture about europe wanting to project herself onto the world stage .
would you like to see him run for it ?
peter mandelson : well i certainly want to see a europe that projects its interests and values more effectively in the world .
i 'm a , in that sense i 'm a projectionist , not a protectionist pro european .
but i think in this particular job , which in my view would play a necessary role in making a europe more effective on the global stage , i would like to see it filled by somebody , you know , who would approach the job in that way .
but you know we are months and months and months , way too premature to start talking about individuals .
i know president sarkozy has put mr blair 's name out there .
but i think there 's a lot of discussion to take place first amongst european heads of government about precisely how they want to see that role fulfilled and therefore who would be most suitable to do the job .
and that conversation ..
andrew marr : has n't started .
peter mandelson : .. simply has not even started .
we have n't even got a treaty that 's ratified .
andrew marr : yeah .
and yet at a personal level presumably you 'd quite like to see him there would n't you ?
peter mandelson : well what 's more important is how other , you know , how european heads of government want to see that job being done .
and i think there 's going to be quite a debate about that .
i think there will be some ..
andrew marr : i thought you 'd just say absolutely , of course i 'd like to see him there .
i 'm interested that you know ..
peter mandelson : well ..
andrew marr : .. you 're not quite so ..
peter mandelson : look what i see him doing is fulfilling a role in the middle east which is very important to him .
he 's preparing for the launch of his faith , faith foundation .
he 's spending enjoyably much more time with his family .
i mean i , personally i want him to be happy doing what he 's doing .
andrew marr : right .
peter mandelson : now i ca n't speak for him and say what would bring him the greatest happiness or the greatest professional reward .
all i see is a man who is extremely focused on what he 's doing in the middle east and who 's terribly committed to preparing this faith foundation .
and , and i think it would be a difficult judgment for him as to , as to whether he suddenly made a , yet , you know another quite big change in his life , having started what he 's doing this year and since he left number ten .
andrew marr : what do you say to all of those people - and there 's a lot of them out there - who feel , from what they 've about the treaty and the constitution , they really are in effect the same thing and that the country 's being bilked of a referendum that was promised ?
peter mandelson : look the , the former constitutional treaty had all the trappings and tassels and thrills and consequences of , what to all intents and purposes was a constitution .
this treaty , a reform treaty has , does not have those constitutional implications .
what it 's about , in a rather more modest way , is to make the european union work more efficiently , to give it a more effective impact in the rest of the world .
and that , andrew , is needed .
you know europe per europe punches below its weight at the moment in the world .
we have strong interests .
we have very powerful values .
people in the rest of the world look to europe to give a lead because of what we stand for and because of what we put into the rest of the world .
but we 're not doing it as effectively and efficiently as we could and should be doing .
andrew marr : rather than the trappings and so forth would it help if britain joined the euro ?
peter mandelson : in what sense would it help ?
would it help europe ?
andrew marr : yes .
peter mandelson : i believe that ..
andrew marr : and britain of course , but i mean ..
peter mandelson : i , i personally think that our future , economic future will be more secure in the euro zone with that currency .
but i 've always accepted that the economic conditions have to be right .
andrew marr : and no chance really of gordon brown launching that at this moment i would have thought ?
peter mandelson : i do n't think there 's any early prospect .
andrew marr : right .
okay .
speaking of which what do you make of - i mean it 's been another rough few months .
charles clarke in the daily mail yesterday launched a pretty ferocious attack on the prime minister saying that he was basically a coward , he was dithering , he could n't take decisions , he did n't trust people .
peter mandelson : daily mail is not my newspaper of choice on a saturday morning so i did n't read ..
andrew marr : charles clarke 's an old mucker of yours .
peter mandelson : he is indeed an old mucker and he 's a good and senior politician .
i mean i do n't know what he said , i do n't know whether he was accurately reported .
andrew marr : so what do you think about gordon brown at the moment ?
peter mandelson : what i would - well , let me say what i 've said first of all about charles clarke .
i think he 's a very able politician who probably belongs sort of in the government rather than outside it and ..
andrew marr : i do n't think that was a way of getting in ..
peter mandelson : .. and , and ..
andrew marr : .. to any government i 've seen .
peter mandelson : and i suspect that was as much a cry of frustration as it , as it is anything else .
on the government , look the immediate transition from tony blair to gordon brown was handled really well .
i mean they both played their part in passing the baton from one to the other .
and it was a good transition from two individuals , from one generation of the cabinet to another .
and indeed i hope from one version of new labour to the other .
now they did n't have a brilliant run in the autumn .
i think they 've come back since the new year sort of having ..
peter mandelson : .. as it were looked at themselves in the face or in the mirror and said right we 've got to do things sort of slightly differently .
andrew marr : and do you think gordon brown is a thoroughly new labour as you would understand it ?
peter mandelson : and i think , and i think that 's what you 're seeing .
i think - look , i think during the autumn you would have been forgiven for wondering whether this was going to be you know a transition from one version of new labour to another .
i think that in what the prime minister has said since january , his interventions , his speeches and also what he 's paving the way to say and do during this year is a strong indicator of a man who has found his bearings , who has his sort of political compass now firmly in his grasp and is getting on top of what it takes to be prime minister .
that is not ...
andrew marr : and yet ¿ peter mandelson : .. that is , you know it 's a hard adjustment to make .
andrew marr : sure .
sure .
peter mandelson : and it has taken few months and i think he 's now very firmly in the saddle , in his stride and i think he 'll see the consequences of that for the government 's performance during this year .
andrew marr : but the other person who 's clearly in the saddle and in his stride is david cameron who i know you saw at davos .
he 's ..
peter mandelson : i ...
andrew marr : ... purely professionally he 's doing very well is n't he ?
as one professional looking at another ?
peter mandelson : well you know he 's not michael howard or william hague or iain duncan smith is he ?
andrew marr : no .
peter mandelson : i mean you know , i mean so enough said .
but i mean , i mean whether he has what it takes to be prime minister , what the depth of the man is , whether he has a really strong policy sense , i do n't know .
but he could not be doing any worse , could he , than his predecessors ?
andrew marr : indeed .
