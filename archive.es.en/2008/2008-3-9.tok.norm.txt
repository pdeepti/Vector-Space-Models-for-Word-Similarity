he opened the antstore , a shop selling 60 species of the insect and all the accessories needed to set up a successful farm . now business is , if not booming , at least crawling along nicely . watching an ant colony can be a heady , even eerie , experience .
it offers a god 's-eye view ; a rare chance for a person to take in an entire , seething , struggling society at a glance . so it may be the philosophical-existential quality of ant-farming that attracts people to the antstore , which computer programmer martin sebesta opened some five years ago in berlin . or , it could be that people are increasingly looking for low-maintainance pets .
ants are easy to feed , suited to apartment life , and don ’ t shed or run up pricey vet bills . whatever the reason , anyone looking for a particular kind of ant has a good chance of finding it at the antstore .
the shop deals in over 60 types of the insect - mostly exotic breeds , from india , south america , australia and japan , among others . sebesta doesn ’ t only sell ant colonies and farms to walk-in customers .
he has a europe-wide internet mail-order business , and also provides creepy-crawlies for film and tv productions .
he even helped set up a zoo exhibit . for beginners , sebesta recommends weaver ants as being easy to care for .
a colony can live on in an apartment on an island set within a plastic tub of water - although “ you have to be careful that they don ’ t use their larvae to build a bridge over the water and crawl out , ” he warns . some breeds , like south american leaf cutters , may be more dramatic , but sebesta recomments them for experienced ant-farmers , as they need a lot of space .
likewise , bulldog ants – long , thin predatory insects that subsist only on living prey – are best kept by people experienced in the care of exotic animals . “ bulldog ants can see prey up to four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- away , ” sebesta said .
“ you can even see them turn their head to watch you when you walk by . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 09.03.2008 socialists celebrate election victory in spain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a high turnout helped zapatero prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has won re-election in spain .
the socialist party -lrb- psoe -rrb- is thought to have benefitted from high voter turnout two days after a basque politician 's murder shocked the country . socialists began celebrating their win soon after polls closed on sunday , march 9 .
" it is a great victory , " the socialist party 's secretary general , jose blanco , annnounced on television .
" it is a victory for all citizens . "
the party won 169 spots in the 350-seat lower house .
with nearly all votes from sunday 's election counted , zapatero 's socialist party had 44 percent , versus 40 percent for the conservative people 's party .
the result give the socialists a plurality , though they 're just shy of the outright 176-seat majority needed to govern alone .
zapatero had been hoping to end his reliance on the support of far-left and regionalist parties , which he has counted on during the past four years .
about 35 million people were eligible to elect the parliament as well as 208 of the 264 members of the senate .
conservatives sidelined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives had hoped for a comeback pio garcia escudero , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- campaign director , conceded defeat sunday night . " i congratulate the socialist party , " garcia escudero has told a press conference in madrid .
" it appears -lsb- their -rsb- victory is clear . "
the loss was a tough blow to the pp , lead by mariano rajoy .
the party seemed unsure during the campaign of how to best stop zapatero 's momentum .
since being elected in 2004 , the socialists have pushed through sweeping social changes , turning spain into one of europe 's most liberal countries on issues such as gay marriage .
zapatero has also sped up divorce , ended compulsory religious education and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants .
the economy was seen as the central theme in the elections , and the pp tried to convince voters it could best handle the economic challenges and keep the country prosperous .
spain 's economy has boomed in the past decade .
yet the annual growth rate could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
and spaniards have worried about unemployment as the country 's construction sector has stagnated .
economy , immigration do n't tip vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero will get four more years the pp had also attacked zapatero for giving 600,000 illegal immigrants the opportunity to have their status “ regularized . ”
rajoy suggested that immigrants should sign an " integration contract " where they promise to respect spain 's laws and customs .
rosa caballero , an insurance worker in madrid , told afp that she was angry after the train bombings in 2004 .
her vote then was “ born of fury and indignation ” over the train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people .
islamist terrorists were responsible , although the pp originally blamed the basque separatist group eta .
caballero told afp she voted for the scialists again on sunday , as did her 19-year-old son , ruben , who said he was n't convinced by the pp arguments on the economy and immigration .
" the slowing of the economy is widespread across europe , " he said .
" immigrants are not a problem here .
they live here happily and more of them should be regularized . ”
socialists get boost from high turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy was unable to convince voters rajoy 's party traditionally enjoys stronger voter turnout among supporters than the socialists , whose voters tend to stay home .
voter turnout was expected to be slightly below the 76 percent in the 2004 elections , when voters turned out en masse to get rid of the ruling conservatives .
the high turnout in 2004 was caused by anger over the pp 's insistence on blaming the basque separatist group eta for deadly train bombings in madrid a few days before the vote .
early indications showed islamist radicals were responsible .
many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused then-pp prime minister jose maria aznar of deliberately misleading them .
basques stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta was blamed for friday 's assassination while voter turnout this time was relatively high , many basques stayed home .
only 53 percent of eligible voters in the basque country cast ballots , according to preliminary election figures .
that was well below the 75 percent turnout that was expected in the rest of spain .
on friday , a former socialist town council member was killed near the coastal city of san sebastian .
all parties immediately blamed the violent separatist group eta , which has been blamed for more than 800 death in spain during the past four decades .
eta has not claimed responsibility for the killing , although police say that it was typical of an eta-style political assassination .
isaias carrasco , who gave up his body guard when he did n't win re-election last fall , was shot outside his home .
eta supporters urged basques to boycott the elections .
" we must vote to teach the terrorists a lesson , " jose angel , a childhood friend of carrasco 's , said as he went to cast his ballot sunday .
" i hope people turn out to vote against everything that has happened .
carrasco 's 19-year-old daughter made an emotional appeal saturday for voters to turn out in large numbers to honor her father and " defeat eta . ”
eta seen as weak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote against eta eta says it wants independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
many spanish commentators felt friday 's assassination showed the group 's weakness and desperation .
zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta , which many felt gave the group legitimacy .
he abandoned them after eta killed two people with a car bomb in december 2006 .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta , which is considered a terrorist group by spain , the european union and the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 09.03.2008 germany 's middle classes shrinking , study warns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's poor are n't just getting poorer , their numbers are rising too germany 's recent economic upswing is bypassing the middle classes , according to an economic research institute .
globalization and greater flexibility in the labor market are widening the gap between rich and poor . forbes magazine ranked 87-year-old karl albrecht , owner of the aldi discounter chain , as number 10 of the world 's richest people .
his wealth has been estimated at $ 27 billion -lrb- 17.7 billion euros -rrb- . albrecht has built his empire on providing food and clothing at knock-down prices to a chain of stores across europe .
but he might soon be losing most of his middle-income customers in germany as the country counts the cost of income inequality . joachim frick from the diw research institute blamed the hartz iv social benefit cutbacks and other social reforms introduced under former chancellor gerhard schröder as the main culprit . " long-term unemployment and more flexible and temporary working patterns have had an negative effect on the middle classes , " said frick . gap between rich and poor widening the german middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate according to a diw report , presenting a challenge to europe 's largest economy . the berlin-based diw research institute said the sharpest fall has been recorded in the number of " average earners " - that 's the group with an income of between 90 percent and 110 percent of the median income - who saw their income drop five percent .
the median income has been set at 16,200 euros , according to equivalized disposable income , and those under 11,340 euro are considered as living in poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can i afford this ?
in 1992 , more than 49 million belonged to the middle class and this figure , representing 62 percent of germany 's total population , remained constant until the end of the 20th century . by 2006 , the number of people in the middle class , dropped to 54 percent , or 44 million people , according to the study by the diw research institute . diw said the rich have become richer and the poor not only poorer but have also gained in size . " there is a bigger concentration on both ends of the scale , " the research institute said in a statement . " the incomes of those in the upper half of society grew faster than those in the lower half , which means that inequalities on the income scale grew , " it said . traditional families hard hit flexible labor patterns are also taking their toll : temporary jobs , part-time work , those self-employed who are dependent on one employer and so-called " one-euro jobs " for those receiving social security benefits . the study said that more than 11 percent had managed to move up to the upper income bracket .
at the other end of the scale , people on lower incomes - those with 70 percent less than the median - have increased significantly since 2000 to 25 percent of the german population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional families have been hard hit by the reforms one of the main casualties have been traditional families.the decline in the number of middle income families with children under the age of 16 has fallen by three million in 2006 .

globalization and greater flexibility in the labor market are widening the gap between rich and poor . forbes magazine ranked 87-year-old karl albrecht , owner of the aldi discounter chain , as number 10 of the world 's richest people .
his wealth has been estimated at $ 27 billion -lrb- 17.7 billion euros -rrb- . albrecht has built his empire on providing food and clothing at knock-down prices to a chain of stores across europe .
but he might soon be losing most of his middle-income customers in germany as the country counts the cost of income inequality . joachim frick from the diw research institute blamed the hartz iv social benefit cutbacks and other social reforms introduced under former chancellor gerhard schröder as the main culprit . " long-term unemployment and more flexible and temporary working patterns have had an negative effect on the middle classes , " said frick . gap between rich and poor widening the german middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate according to a diw report , presenting a challenge to europe 's largest economy . the berlin-based diw research institute said the sharpest fall has been recorded in the number of " average earners " - that 's the group with an income of between 90 percent and 110 percent of the median income - who saw their income drop five percent .
the median income has been set at 16,200 euros , according to equivalized disposable income , and those under 11,340 euro are considered as living in poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can i afford this ?

" there is a bigger concentration on both ends of the scale , " the research institute said in a statement . " the incomes of those in the upper half of society grew faster than those in the lower half , which means that inequalities on the income scale grew , " it said . traditional families hard hit flexible labor patterns are also taking their toll : temporary jobs , part-time work , those self-employed who are dependent on one employer and so-called " one-euro jobs " for those receiving social security benefits . the study said that more than 11 percent had managed to move up to the upper income bracket .
at the other end of the scale , people on lower incomes - those with 70 percent less than the median - have increased significantly since 2000 to 25 percent of the german population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional families have been hard hit by the reforms one of the main casualties have been traditional families.the decline in the number of middle income families with children under the age of 16 has fallen by three million in 2006 .

globalization and greater flexibility in the labor market are widening the gap between rich and poor . forbes magazine ranked 87-year-old karl albrecht , owner of the aldi discounter chain , as number 10 of the world 's richest people .
his wealth has been estimated at $ 27 billion -lrb- 17.7 billion euros -rrb- . albrecht has built his empire on providing food and clothing at knock-down prices to a chain of stores across europe .
but he might soon be losing most of his middle-income customers in germany as the country counts the cost of income inequality . joachim frick from the diw research institute blamed the hartz iv social benefit cutbacks and other social reforms introduced under former chancellor gerhard schröder as the main culprit . " long-term unemployment and more flexible and temporary working patterns have had an negative effect on the middle classes , " said frick . gap between rich and poor widening the german middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate according to a diw report , presenting a challenge to europe 's largest economy . the berlin-based diw research institute said the sharpest fall has been recorded in the number of " average earners " - that 's the group with an income of between 90 percent and 110 percent of the median income - who saw their income drop five percent .
the median income has been set at 16,200 euros , according to equivalized disposable income , and those under 11,340 euro are considered as living in poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can i afford this ?
in 1992 , more than 49 million belonged to the middle class and this figure , representing 62 percent of germany 's total population , remained constant until the end of the 20th century . by 2006 , the number of people in the middle class , dropped to 54 percent , or 44 million people , according to the study by the diw research institute . diw said the rich have become richer and the poor not only poorer but have also gained in size . " there is a bigger concentration on both ends of the scale , " the research institute said in a statement . " the incomes of those in the upper half of society grew faster than those in the lower half , which means that inequalities on the income scale grew , " it said . traditional families hard hit flexible labor patterns are also taking their toll : temporary jobs , part-time work , those self-employed who are dependent on one employer and so-called " one-euro jobs " for those receiving social security benefits . the study said that more than 11 percent had managed to move up to the upper income bracket .
at the other end of the scale , people on lower incomes - those with 70 percent less than the median - have increased significantly since 2000 to 25 percent of the german population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional families have been hard hit by the reforms one of the main casualties have been traditional families.the decline in the number of middle income families with children under the age of 16 has fallen by three million in 2006 .
but also one million people living in multi-generational households have seen their income fall into lower income bracket . economic upswing faltering germany has emerged from a period of stagnation to experience a mini-economic miracle over the last two years , largely thanks to stronger exports .
but a stronger euro , coupled with rising labor costs and energy prices have dented the economic upswing . the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast for the third time in less than a year to 1.7 percent from 2 percent .
economy minister michael glos said the revision amounted to an appeal to avoid excessive wage accords . corporate profits from 2002-2006 have increased by roughly a third , however , compared to workers ' salaries according to the federal statistics office . the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- said real take-home pay had declined 3.5 per cent for salaried employees since the upswing began in the last quarter of 2004 . the federal statistical office -lrb- destatis -rrb- in a recent study said that just under 13 percent of the population in germany were at risk of poverty .
according to the eu definition , the at-risk-of-poverty rate is the share of persons having to manage on less than 60 percent of their mean income of the entire population . that 's nearly 11 million , including 1.7 million children .
that 's less than most of the eu 's 27 member countries with only scandanavian countries achieving better results .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 09.03.2008 socialists celebrate election victory in spain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a high turnout helped zapatero prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has won re-election in spain .
the socialist party -lrb- psoe -rrb- is thought to have benefitted from high voter turnout two days after a basque politician 's murder shocked the country . socialists began celebrating their win soon after polls closed on sunday , march 9 .
" it is a great victory , " the socialist party 's secretary general , jose blanco , annnounced on television .
" it is a victory for all citizens . "
the party won 169 spots in the 350-seat lower house .
with nearly all votes from sunday 's election counted , zapatero 's socialist party had 44 percent , versus 40 percent for the conservative people 's party .
the result give the socialists a plurality , though they 're just shy of the outright 176-seat majority needed to govern alone .
zapatero had been hoping to end his reliance on the support of far-left and regionalist parties , which he has counted on during the past four years .
about 35 million people were eligible to elect the parliament as well as 208 of the 264 members of the senate .
conservatives sidelined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives had hoped for a comeback pio garcia escudero , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- campaign director , conceded defeat sunday night . " i congratulate the socialist party , " garcia escudero has told a press conference in madrid .
" it appears -lsb- their -rsb- victory is clear . "
the loss was a tough blow to the pp , lead by mariano rajoy .
the party seemed unsure during the campaign of how to best stop zapatero 's momentum .
since being elected in 2004 , the socialists have pushed through sweeping social changes , turning spain into one of europe 's most liberal countries on issues such as gay marriage .
zapatero has also sped up divorce , ended compulsory religious education and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants .
the economy was seen as the central theme in the elections , and the pp tried to convince voters it could best handle the economic challenges and keep the country prosperous .
spain 's economy has boomed in the past decade .
yet the annual growth rate could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
and spaniards have worried about unemployment as the country 's construction sector has stagnated .
economy , immigration do n't tip vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero will get four more years the pp had also attacked zapatero for giving 600,000 illegal immigrants the opportunity to have their status “ regularized . ”
rajoy suggested that immigrants should sign an " integration contract " where they promise to respect spain 's laws and customs .
rosa caballero , an insurance worker in madrid , told afp that she was angry after the train bombings in 2004 .
her vote then was “ born of fury and indignation ” over the train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people .
islamist terrorists were responsible , although the pp originally blamed the basque separatist group eta .
caballero told afp she voted for the scialists again on sunday , as did her 19-year-old son , ruben , who said he was n't convinced by the pp arguments on the economy and immigration .
" the slowing of the economy is widespread across europe , " he said .
" immigrants are not a problem here .
they live here happily and more of them should be regularized . ”
socialists get boost from high turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy was unable to convince voters rajoy 's party traditionally enjoys stronger voter turnout among supporters than the socialists , whose voters tend to stay home .
voter turnout was expected to be slightly below the 76 percent in the 2004 elections , when voters turned out en masse to get rid of the ruling conservatives .
the high turnout in 2004 was caused by anger over the pp 's insistence on blaming the basque separatist group eta for deadly train bombings in madrid a few days before the vote .
early indications showed islamist radicals were responsible .
many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused then-pp prime minister jose maria aznar of deliberately misleading them .
basques stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta was blamed for friday 's assassination while voter turnout this time was relatively high , many basques stayed home .
only 53 percent of eligible voters in the basque country cast ballots , according to preliminary election figures .
that was well below the 75 percent turnout that was expected in the rest of spain .
on friday , a former socialist town council member was killed near the coastal city of san sebastian .
all parties immediately blamed the violent separatist group eta , which has been blamed for more than 800 death in spain during the past four decades .
eta has not claimed responsibility for the killing , although police say that it was typical of an eta-style political assassination .
isaias carrasco , who gave up his body guard when he did n't win re-election last fall , was shot outside his home .
eta supporters urged basques to boycott the elections .
" we must vote to teach the terrorists a lesson , " jose angel , a childhood friend of carrasco 's , said as he went to cast his ballot sunday .
" i hope people turn out to vote against everything that has happened .
carrasco 's 19-year-old daughter made an emotional appeal saturday for voters to turn out in large numbers to honor her father and " defeat eta . ”
eta seen as weak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote against eta eta says it wants independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
many spanish commentators felt friday 's assassination showed the group 's weakness and desperation .
zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta , which many felt gave the group legitimacy .
he abandoned them after eta killed two people with a car bomb in december 2006 .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta , which is considered a terrorist group by spain , the european union and the united states .

caballero told afp she voted for the scialists again on sunday , as did her 19-year-old son , ruben , who said he was n't convinced by the pp arguments on the economy and immigration .
" the slowing of the economy is widespread across europe , " he said .

socialists get boost from high turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy was unable to convince voters rajoy 's party traditionally enjoys stronger voter turnout among supporters than the socialists , whose voters tend to stay home .
voter turnout was expected to be slightly below the 76 percent in the 2004 elections , when voters turned out en masse to get rid of the ruling conservatives .
the high turnout in 2004 was caused by anger over the pp 's insistence on blaming the basque separatist group eta for deadly train bombings in madrid a few days before the vote .
early indications showed islamist radicals were responsible .
many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused then-pp prime minister jose maria aznar of deliberately misleading them .
basques stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta was blamed for friday 's assassination while voter turnout this time was relatively high , many basques stayed home .
only 53 percent of eligible voters in the basque country cast ballots , according to preliminary election figures .
that was well below the 75 percent turnout that was expected in the rest of spain .
on friday , a former socialist town council member was killed near the coastal city of san sebastian .
all parties immediately blamed the violent separatist group eta , which has been blamed for more than 800 death in spain during the past four decades .
eta has not claimed responsibility for the killing , although police say that it was typical of an eta-style political assassination .
isaias carrasco , who gave up his body guard when he did n't win re-election last fall , was shot outside his home .
eta supporters urged basques to boycott the elections .
" we must vote to teach the terrorists a lesson , " jose angel , a childhood friend of carrasco 's , said as he went to cast his ballot sunday .
" i hope people turn out to vote against everything that has happened .
carrasco 's 19-year-old daughter made an emotional appeal saturday for voters to turn out in large numbers to honor her father and " defeat eta . ”
eta seen as weak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote against eta eta says it wants independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
many spanish commentators felt friday 's assassination showed the group 's weakness and desperation .
zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta , which many felt gave the group legitimacy .
he abandoned them after eta killed two people with a car bomb in december 2006 .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta , which is considered a terrorist group by spain , the european union and the united states .

the socialist party -lrb- psoe -rrb- is thought to have benefitted from high voter turnout two days after a basque politician 's murder shocked the country . socialists began celebrating their win soon after polls closed on sunday , march 9 .
" it is a great victory , " the socialist party 's secretary general , jose blanco , annnounced on television .
" it is a victory for all citizens . "
the party won 169 spots in the 350-seat lower house .
with nearly all votes from sunday 's election counted , zapatero 's socialist party had 44 percent , versus 40 percent for the conservative people 's party .
the result give the socialists a plurality , though they 're just shy of the outright 176-seat majority needed to govern alone .
zapatero had been hoping to end his reliance on the support of far-left and regionalist parties , which he has counted on during the past four years .
about 35 million people were eligible to elect the parliament as well as 208 of the 264 members of the senate .

" it appears -lsb- their -rsb- victory is clear . "
the loss was a tough blow to the pp , lead by mariano rajoy .
the party seemed unsure during the campaign of how to best stop zapatero 's momentum .
since being elected in 2004 , the socialists have pushed through sweeping social changes , turning spain into one of europe 's most liberal countries on issues such as gay marriage .
zapatero has also sped up divorce , ended compulsory religious education and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants .
the economy was seen as the central theme in the elections , and the pp tried to convince voters it could best handle the economic challenges and keep the country prosperous .
spain 's economy has boomed in the past decade .

he opened the antstore , a shop selling 60 species of the insect and all the accessories needed to set up a successful farm . now business is , if not booming , at least crawling along nicely . watching an ant colony can be a heady , even eerie , experience .
it offers a god 's-eye view ; a rare chance for a person to take in an entire , seething , struggling society at a glance . so it may be the philosophical-existential quality of ant-farming that attracts people to the antstore , which computer programmer martin sebesta opened some five years ago in berlin . or , it could be that people are increasingly looking for low-maintainance pets .
ants are easy to feed , suited to apartment life , and don ’ t shed or run up pricey vet bills . whatever the reason , anyone looking for a particular kind of ant has a good chance of finding it at the antstore .
the shop deals in over 60 types of the insect - mostly exotic breeds , from india , south america , australia and japan , among others . sebesta doesn ’ t only sell ant colonies and farms to walk-in customers .
he has a europe-wide internet mail-order business , and also provides creepy-crawlies for film and tv productions .
he even helped set up a zoo exhibit . for beginners , sebesta recommends weaver ants as being easy to care for .
a colony can live on in an apartment on an island set within a plastic tub of water - although “ you have to be careful that they don ’ t use their larvae to build a bridge over the water and crawl out , ” he warns . some breeds , like south american leaf cutters , may be more dramatic , but sebesta recomments them for experienced ant-farmers , as they need a lot of space .
likewise , bulldog ants – long , thin predatory insects that subsist only on living prey – are best kept by people experienced in the care of exotic animals . “ bulldog ants can see prey up to four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- away , ” sebesta said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carrasco was shot dead in front of his family the killing of a former socialist councillor in the basque country has cast a heavy pall on sunday 's voting .
the socialist government and conservative opposition have blamed basque guerrillas of eta for friday 's shooting of isaias carrasco who was assassinated in front of his wife and young daughter outside his house in a small town near the basque coastal city of san sebastian .
zapatero has said the shooting was an attempt by eta to interfere with the elections .
" but spanish democracy has demonstrated that it does not allow challenges from those who oppose its basic principles and its most essential values , " he said .
murder reminiscent of madrid bombings the timing of the latest killing has stirred memories of an election-eve massacre by islamic militants who killed 191 people in a string of bombings against commuter trains in madrid in march 2004 .
at the time , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- led by then prime minister jose maria aznar seemed almost certain to win for the third consecutive term during the last national elections in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's last general election was marked by carnage but anger at the conservative government 's attempts to blame those bombings on eta , despite mounting evidence that it was the work of islamists , helped opposition leader zapatero to come from behind to win the elections . many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused aznar of deliberately misleading them .
the latest murder is not expected by many to have a huge impact on the vote both of its small scale and the fact that the two main parties hold relatively similar positions on not negotiating with eta .
eta has killed 820 people in spain during the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero has been under fire for his approach to eta zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta .
in statement read on television friday , mariano rajoy of the conservative pp urged spaniards to " be united against eta , " which should now lose " all hope of achieving its political objectives . "
this time , voters remain more worried about the cooling economy as spaniards struggle with rising unemployment , currently at 2.3 million .
economy remains the key spain 's economy has had among the fastest growth rates in europe during recent years , with 500,000 jobs created annually .
yet indications show that the country 's building boom is coming to an end and growth slowed to 3.8 percent in 2007 .
while the government has a surplus to fall back on , many spaniards , fearing an economic crisis , have put off purchases .
that in turn has caused retail sales and industrial production to taper off .
the job market has shown signs of shrinking , food prices have increased and growth could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
yet many voters find the economic plans of the ruling socialist party , led by jose luis rodrigo zapatero , and his center-right challenger , mariano rajoy of the pp to be nearly indistinguishable .
bitter , populist campaign a bitterly fought campaign marked by nasty personal attacks between the ruling socialist party and the pp has turned off many voters . during their last televised debate , zapatero and rajoy clashed over anti- terrorism policy , immigration and the outlook for the spanish economy , continuously called each other " liars . "
populist rhetoric has dominated the campaign , with the socialists pledging social spending and the pp promising to make immigrants respect spanish customs and to fight juvenile crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy has lashed out at zapatero over his immigration policies rajoy has confronted zapatero 's decision to offer residence permits to more than half a million illegal immigrants who were working in spain when he came to power .
rajoy said the influx of foreigners was leaving many poorer spaniards worse off and jeopardizing public security .
he pledged to expel any immigrant convicted of a crime .
the parties have also fallen over themselves promising lower taxes , higher pensions , free dental care and cheaper mortgages .
both parties need to win not only the support of swing voters but also motivate their supporters to go to the polls in large numbers in order to win the elections .
with the parties close , the winner could have to rely on the support of smaller parties to form a government .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carrasco was shot dead in front of his family the killing of a former socialist councillor in the basque country has cast a heavy pall on sunday 's voting .
the socialist government and conservative opposition have blamed basque guerrillas of eta for friday 's shooting of isaias carrasco who was assassinated in front of his wife and young daughter outside his house in a small town near the basque coastal city of san sebastian .
zapatero has said the shooting was an attempt by eta to interfere with the elections .
" but spanish democracy has demonstrated that it does not allow challenges from those who oppose its basic principles and its most essential values , " he said .
murder reminiscent of madrid bombings the timing of the latest killing has stirred memories of an election-eve massacre by islamic militants who killed 191 people in a string of bombings against commuter trains in madrid in march 2004 .
at the time , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- led by then prime minister jose maria aznar seemed almost certain to win for the third consecutive term during the last national elections in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's last general election was marked by carnage but anger at the conservative government 's attempts to blame those bombings on eta , despite mounting evidence that it was the work of islamists , helped opposition leader zapatero to come from behind to win the elections . many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused aznar of deliberately misleading them .
the latest murder is not expected by many to have a huge impact on the vote both of its small scale and the fact that the two main parties hold relatively similar positions on not negotiating with eta .
eta has killed 820 people in spain during the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero has been under fire for his approach to eta zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta .
in statement read on television friday , mariano rajoy of the conservative pp urged spaniards to " be united against eta , " which should now lose " all hope of achieving its political objectives . "
this time , voters remain more worried about the cooling economy as spaniards struggle with rising unemployment , currently at 2.3 million .
economy remains the key spain 's economy has had among the fastest growth rates in europe during recent years , with 500,000 jobs created annually .
yet indications show that the country 's building boom is coming to an end and growth slowed to 3.8 percent in 2007 .
while the government has a surplus to fall back on , many spaniards , fearing an economic crisis , have put off purchases .
that in turn has caused retail sales and industrial production to taper off .
the job market has shown signs of shrinking , food prices have increased and growth could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
yet many voters find the economic plans of the ruling socialist party , led by jose luis rodrigo zapatero , and his center-right challenger , mariano rajoy of the pp to be nearly indistinguishable .
bitter , populist campaign a bitterly fought campaign marked by nasty personal attacks between the ruling socialist party and the pp has turned off many voters . during their last televised debate , zapatero and rajoy clashed over anti- terrorism policy , immigration and the outlook for the spanish economy , continuously called each other " liars . "
populist rhetoric has dominated the campaign , with the socialists pledging social spending and the pp promising to make immigrants respect spanish customs and to fight juvenile crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy has lashed out at zapatero over his immigration policies rajoy has confronted zapatero 's decision to offer residence permits to more than half a million illegal immigrants who were working in spain when he came to power .
rajoy said the influx of foreigners was leaving many poorer spaniards worse off and jeopardizing public security .
he pledged to expel any immigrant convicted of a crime .
the parties have also fallen over themselves promising lower taxes , higher pensions , free dental care and cheaper mortgages .
both parties need to win not only the support of swing voters but also motivate their supporters to go to the polls in large numbers in order to win the elections .
with the parties close , the winner could have to rely on the support of smaller parties to form a government .
zapatero has been in a thorny alliance with the separatist republican left of catalonia -lrb- erc -rrb- and the united left , a coalition of greens and communists .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carrasco was shot dead in front of his family the killing of a former socialist councillor in the basque country has cast a heavy pall on sunday 's voting .
the socialist government and conservative opposition have blamed basque guerrillas of eta for friday 's shooting of isaias carrasco who was assassinated in front of his wife and young daughter outside his house in a small town near the basque coastal city of san sebastian .
zapatero has said the shooting was an attempt by eta to interfere with the elections .
" but spanish democracy has demonstrated that it does not allow challenges from those who oppose its basic principles and its most essential values , " he said .
murder reminiscent of madrid bombings the timing of the latest killing has stirred memories of an election-eve massacre by islamic militants who killed 191 people in a string of bombings against commuter trains in madrid in march 2004 .
at the time , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- led by then prime minister jose maria aznar seemed almost certain to win for the third consecutive term during the last national elections in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's last general election was marked by carnage but anger at the conservative government 's attempts to blame those bombings on eta , despite mounting evidence that it was the work of islamists , helped opposition leader zapatero to come from behind to win the elections . many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused aznar of deliberately misleading them .
the latest murder is not expected by many to have a huge impact on the vote both of its small scale and the fact that the two main parties hold relatively similar positions on not negotiating with eta .
eta has killed 820 people in spain during the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero has been under fire for his approach to eta zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta .
in statement read on television friday , mariano rajoy of the conservative pp urged spaniards to " be united against eta , " which should now lose " all hope of achieving its political objectives . "
this time , voters remain more worried about the cooling economy as spaniards struggle with rising unemployment , currently at 2.3 million .
economy remains the key spain 's economy has had among the fastest growth rates in europe during recent years , with 500,000 jobs created annually .
yet indications show that the country 's building boom is coming to an end and growth slowed to 3.8 percent in 2007 .
while the government has a surplus to fall back on , many spaniards , fearing an economic crisis , have put off purchases .
that in turn has caused retail sales and industrial production to taper off .
the job market has shown signs of shrinking , food prices have increased and growth could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
yet many voters find the economic plans of the ruling socialist party , led by jose luis rodrigo zapatero , and his center-right challenger , mariano rajoy of the pp to be nearly indistinguishable .
bitter , populist campaign a bitterly fought campaign marked by nasty personal attacks between the ruling socialist party and the pp has turned off many voters . during their last televised debate , zapatero and rajoy clashed over anti- terrorism policy , immigration and the outlook for the spanish economy , continuously called each other " liars . "
populist rhetoric has dominated the campaign , with the socialists pledging social spending and the pp promising to make immigrants respect spanish customs and to fight juvenile crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy has lashed out at zapatero over his immigration policies rajoy has confronted zapatero 's decision to offer residence permits to more than half a million illegal immigrants who were working in spain when he came to power .
rajoy said the influx of foreigners was leaving many poorer spaniards worse off and jeopardizing public security .
he pledged to expel any immigrant convicted of a crime .
the parties have also fallen over themselves promising lower taxes , higher pensions , free dental care and cheaper mortgages .
both parties need to win not only the support of swing voters but also motivate their supporters to go to the polls in large numbers in order to win the elections .
with the parties close , the winner could have to rely on the support of smaller parties to form a government .
zapatero has been in a thorny alliance with the separatist republican left of catalonia -lrb- erc -rrb- and the united left , a coalition of greens and communists .
parties far apart on social issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a close race , differences on social issues may matter in a very close race , voters will likely take a look at the differences between social issues , experts say .
zapatero 's government pushed through fast-track divorces , legalized gay marriage and adoption , granted amnesty to many illegal immigrants and ended compulsory religious education in schools .
the people 's party fiercely opposed these initiatives , although it has been reluctant to make a big deal about them in the campaign , worried that doing so could backfire with swing voters . dw staff -lrb- th / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

globalization and greater flexibility in the labor market are widening the gap between rich and poor . forbes magazine ranked 87-year-old karl albrecht , owner of the aldi discounter chain , as number 10 of the world 's richest people .
his wealth has been estimated at $ 27 billion -lrb- 17.7 billion euros -rrb- . albrecht has built his empire on providing food and clothing at knock-down prices to a chain of stores across europe .
but he might soon be losing most of his middle-income customers in germany as the country counts the cost of income inequality . joachim frick from the diw research institute blamed the hartz iv social benefit cutbacks and other social reforms introduced under former chancellor gerhard schröder as the main culprit . " long-term unemployment and more flexible and temporary working patterns have had an negative effect on the middle classes , " said frick . gap between rich and poor widening the german middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate according to a diw report , presenting a challenge to europe 's largest economy . the berlin-based diw research institute said the sharpest fall has been recorded in the number of " average earners " - that 's the group with an income of between 90 percent and 110 percent of the median income - who saw their income drop five percent .
the median income has been set at 16,200 euros , according to equivalized disposable income , and those under 11,340 euro are considered as living in poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can i afford this ?
in 1992 , more than 49 million belonged to the middle class and this figure , representing 62 percent of germany 's total population , remained constant until the end of the 20th century . by 2006 , the number of people in the middle class , dropped to 54 percent , or 44 million people , according to the study by the diw research institute . diw said the rich have become richer and the poor not only poorer but have also gained in size . " there is a bigger concentration on both ends of the scale , " the research institute said in a statement . " the incomes of those in the upper half of society grew faster than those in the lower half , which means that inequalities on the income scale grew , " it said . traditional families hard hit flexible labor patterns are also taking their toll : temporary jobs , part-time work , those self-employed who are dependent on one employer and so-called " one-euro jobs " for those receiving social security benefits . the study said that more than 11 percent had managed to move up to the upper income bracket .
at the other end of the scale , people on lower incomes - those with 70 percent less than the median - have increased significantly since 2000 to 25 percent of the german population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional families have been hard hit by the reforms one of the main casualties have been traditional families.the decline in the number of middle income families with children under the age of 16 has fallen by three million in 2006 .
but also one million people living in multi-generational households have seen their income fall into lower income bracket . economic upswing faltering germany has emerged from a period of stagnation to experience a mini-economic miracle over the last two years , largely thanks to stronger exports .
but a stronger euro , coupled with rising labor costs and energy prices have dented the economic upswing . the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast for the third time in less than a year to 1.7 percent from 2 percent .
economy minister michael glos said the revision amounted to an appeal to avoid excessive wage accords . corporate profits from 2002-2006 have increased by roughly a third , however , compared to workers ' salaries according to the federal statistics office . the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- said real take-home pay had declined 3.5 per cent for salaried employees since the upswing began in the last quarter of 2004 . the federal statistical office -lrb- destatis -rrb- in a recent study said that just under 13 percent of the population in germany were at risk of poverty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 09.03.2008 spanish voters head to polls overshadowed by eta killing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero greets an election voter on sunday at a polling booth crammed with journalists spaniards vote sunday in a general election overshadowed by the killing of a politician in the basque country after a bitterly fought campaign dominated by concerns over a slowing economy and immigration . public opinion polls suggest a win by spain 's incumbent socialist party led by prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero although by a margin that would leave them short of an absolute majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carrasco was shot dead in front of his family the killing of a former socialist councillor in the basque country has cast a heavy pall on sunday 's voting .
the socialist government and conservative opposition have blamed basque guerrillas of eta for friday 's shooting of isaias carrasco who was assassinated in front of his wife and young daughter outside his house in a small town near the basque coastal city of san sebastian .
zapatero has said the shooting was an attempt by eta to interfere with the elections .
" but spanish democracy has demonstrated that it does not allow challenges from those who oppose its basic principles and its most essential values , " he said .
murder reminiscent of madrid bombings the timing of the latest killing has stirred memories of an election-eve massacre by islamic militants who killed 191 people in a string of bombings against commuter trains in madrid in march 2004 .
at the time , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- led by then prime minister jose maria aznar seemed almost certain to win for the third consecutive term during the last national elections in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's last general election was marked by carnage but anger at the conservative government 's attempts to blame those bombings on eta , despite mounting evidence that it was the work of islamists , helped opposition leader zapatero to come from behind to win the elections . many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused aznar of deliberately misleading them .
the latest murder is not expected by many to have a huge impact on the vote both of its small scale and the fact that the two main parties hold relatively similar positions on not negotiating with eta .
eta has killed 820 people in spain during the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero has been under fire for his approach to eta zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta .
in statement read on television friday , mariano rajoy of the conservative pp urged spaniards to " be united against eta , " which should now lose " all hope of achieving its political objectives . "
this time , voters remain more worried about the cooling economy as spaniards struggle with rising unemployment , currently at 2.3 million .
economy remains the key spain 's economy has had among the fastest growth rates in europe during recent years , with 500,000 jobs created annually .
yet indications show that the country 's building boom is coming to an end and growth slowed to 3.8 percent in 2007 .
while the government has a surplus to fall back on , many spaniards , fearing an economic crisis , have put off purchases .
that in turn has caused retail sales and industrial production to taper off .
the job market has shown signs of shrinking , food prices have increased and growth could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
yet many voters find the economic plans of the ruling socialist party , led by jose luis rodrigo zapatero , and his center-right challenger , mariano rajoy of the pp to be nearly indistinguishable .
bitter , populist campaign a bitterly fought campaign marked by nasty personal attacks between the ruling socialist party and the pp has turned off many voters . during their last televised debate , zapatero and rajoy clashed over anti- terrorism policy , immigration and the outlook for the spanish economy , continuously called each other " liars . "
populist rhetoric has dominated the campaign , with the socialists pledging social spending and the pp promising to make immigrants respect spanish customs and to fight juvenile crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy has lashed out at zapatero over his immigration policies rajoy has confronted zapatero 's decision to offer residence permits to more than half a million illegal immigrants who were working in spain when he came to power .
rajoy said the influx of foreigners was leaving many poorer spaniards worse off and jeopardizing public security .
he pledged to expel any immigrant convicted of a crime .
the parties have also fallen over themselves promising lower taxes , higher pensions , free dental care and cheaper mortgages .
both parties need to win not only the support of swing voters but also motivate their supporters to go to the polls in large numbers in order to win the elections .
with the parties close , the winner could have to rely on the support of smaller parties to form a government .
zapatero has been in a thorny alliance with the separatist republican left of catalonia -lrb- erc -rrb- and the united left , a coalition of greens and communists .
parties far apart on social issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a close race , differences on social issues may matter in a very close race , voters will likely take a look at the differences between social issues , experts say .
zapatero 's government pushed through fast-track divorces , legalized gay marriage and adoption , granted amnesty to many illegal immigrants and ended compulsory religious education in schools .
the people 's party fiercely opposed these initiatives , although it has been reluctant to make a big deal about them in the campaign , worried that doing so could backfire with swing voters . dw staff -lrb- th / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 09.03.2008 germany 's middle classes shrinking , study warns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's poor are n't just getting poorer , their numbers are rising too germany 's recent economic upswing is bypassing the middle classes , according to an economic research institute .
globalization and greater flexibility in the labor market are widening the gap between rich and poor . forbes magazine ranked 87-year-old karl albrecht , owner of the aldi discounter chain , as number 10 of the world 's richest people .
his wealth has been estimated at $ 27 billion -lrb- 17.7 billion euros -rrb- . albrecht has built his empire on providing food and clothing at knock-down prices to a chain of stores across europe .
but he might soon be losing most of his middle-income customers in germany as the country counts the cost of income inequality . joachim frick from the diw research institute blamed the hartz iv social benefit cutbacks and other social reforms introduced under former chancellor gerhard schröder as the main culprit . " long-term unemployment and more flexible and temporary working patterns have had an negative effect on the middle classes , " said frick . gap between rich and poor widening the german middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate according to a diw report , presenting a challenge to europe 's largest economy . the berlin-based diw research institute said the sharpest fall has been recorded in the number of " average earners " - that 's the group with an income of between 90 percent and 110 percent of the median income - who saw their income drop five percent .
the median income has been set at 16,200 euros , according to equivalized disposable income , and those under 11,340 euro are considered as living in poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can i afford this ?
in 1992 , more than 49 million belonged to the middle class and this figure , representing 62 percent of germany 's total population , remained constant until the end of the 20th century . by 2006 , the number of people in the middle class , dropped to 54 percent , or 44 million people , according to the study by the diw research institute . diw said the rich have become richer and the poor not only poorer but have also gained in size .

globalization and greater flexibility in the labor market are widening the gap between rich and poor . forbes magazine ranked 87-year-old karl albrecht , owner of the aldi discounter chain , as number 10 of the world 's richest people .
his wealth has been estimated at $ 27 billion -lrb- 17.7 billion euros -rrb- . albrecht has built his empire on providing food and clothing at knock-down prices to a chain of stores across europe .
but he might soon be losing most of his middle-income customers in germany as the country counts the cost of income inequality . joachim frick from the diw research institute blamed the hartz iv social benefit cutbacks and other social reforms introduced under former chancellor gerhard schröder as the main culprit . " long-term unemployment and more flexible and temporary working patterns have had an negative effect on the middle classes , " said frick . gap between rich and poor widening the german middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate according to a diw report , presenting a challenge to europe 's largest economy . the berlin-based diw research institute said the sharpest fall has been recorded in the number of " average earners " - that 's the group with an income of between 90 percent and 110 percent of the median income - who saw their income drop five percent .
the median income has been set at 16,200 euros , according to equivalized disposable income , and those under 11,340 euro are considered as living in poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can i afford this ?
in 1992 , more than 49 million belonged to the middle class and this figure , representing 62 percent of germany 's total population , remained constant until the end of the 20th century . by 2006 , the number of people in the middle class , dropped to 54 percent , or 44 million people , according to the study by the diw research institute . diw said the rich have become richer and the poor not only poorer but have also gained in size . " there is a bigger concentration on both ends of the scale , " the research institute said in a statement . " the incomes of those in the upper half of society grew faster than those in the lower half , which means that inequalities on the income scale grew , " it said . traditional families hard hit flexible labor patterns are also taking their toll : temporary jobs , part-time work , those self-employed who are dependent on one employer and so-called " one-euro jobs " for those receiving social security benefits . the study said that more than 11 percent had managed to move up to the upper income bracket .
at the other end of the scale , people on lower incomes - those with 70 percent less than the median - have increased significantly since 2000 to 25 percent of the german population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional families have been hard hit by the reforms one of the main casualties have been traditional families.the decline in the number of middle income families with children under the age of 16 has fallen by three million in 2006 .
but also one million people living in multi-generational households have seen their income fall into lower income bracket . economic upswing faltering germany has emerged from a period of stagnation to experience a mini-economic miracle over the last two years , largely thanks to stronger exports .
but a stronger euro , coupled with rising labor costs and energy prices have dented the economic upswing . the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast for the third time in less than a year to 1.7 percent from 2 percent .

he opened the antstore , a shop selling 60 species of the insect and all the accessories needed to set up a successful farm . now business is , if not booming , at least crawling along nicely . watching an ant colony can be a heady , even eerie , experience .
it offers a god 's-eye view ; a rare chance for a person to take in an entire , seething , struggling society at a glance . so it may be the philosophical-existential quality of ant-farming that attracts people to the antstore , which computer programmer martin sebesta opened some five years ago in berlin . or , it could be that people are increasingly looking for low-maintainance pets .
ants are easy to feed , suited to apartment life , and don ’ t shed or run up pricey vet bills . whatever the reason , anyone looking for a particular kind of ant has a good chance of finding it at the antstore .
the shop deals in over 60 types of the insect - mostly exotic breeds , from india , south america , australia and japan , among others . sebesta doesn ’ t only sell ant colonies and farms to walk-in customers .
he has a europe-wide internet mail-order business , and also provides creepy-crawlies for film and tv productions .
he even helped set up a zoo exhibit . for beginners , sebesta recommends weaver ants as being easy to care for .
a colony can live on in an apartment on an island set within a plastic tub of water - although “ you have to be careful that they don ’ t use their larvae to build a bridge over the water and crawl out , ” he warns . some breeds , like south american leaf cutters , may be more dramatic , but sebesta recomments them for experienced ant-farmers , as they need a lot of space .
likewise , bulldog ants – long , thin predatory insects that subsist only on living prey – are best kept by people experienced in the care of exotic animals . “ bulldog ants can see prey up to four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- away , ” sebesta said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 09.03.2008 socialists celebrate election victory in spain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a high turnout helped zapatero prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has won re-election in spain .
the socialist party -lrb- psoe -rrb- is thought to have benefitted from high voter turnout two days after a basque politician 's murder shocked the country . socialists began celebrating their win soon after polls closed on sunday , march 9 .
" it is a great victory , " the socialist party 's secretary general , jose blanco , annnounced on television .
" it is a victory for all citizens . "
the party won 169 spots in the 350-seat lower house .
with nearly all votes from sunday 's election counted , zapatero 's socialist party had 44 percent , versus 40 percent for the conservative people 's party .
the result give the socialists a plurality , though they 're just shy of the outright 176-seat majority needed to govern alone .
zapatero had been hoping to end his reliance on the support of far-left and regionalist parties , which he has counted on during the past four years .
about 35 million people were eligible to elect the parliament as well as 208 of the 264 members of the senate .
conservatives sidelined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives had hoped for a comeback pio garcia escudero , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- campaign director , conceded defeat sunday night . " i congratulate the socialist party , " garcia escudero has told a press conference in madrid .
" it appears -lsb- their -rsb- victory is clear . "
the loss was a tough blow to the pp , lead by mariano rajoy .
the party seemed unsure during the campaign of how to best stop zapatero 's momentum .
since being elected in 2004 , the socialists have pushed through sweeping social changes , turning spain into one of europe 's most liberal countries on issues such as gay marriage .
zapatero has also sped up divorce , ended compulsory religious education and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants .
the economy was seen as the central theme in the elections , and the pp tried to convince voters it could best handle the economic challenges and keep the country prosperous .
spain 's economy has boomed in the past decade .
yet the annual growth rate could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
and spaniards have worried about unemployment as the country 's construction sector has stagnated .
economy , immigration do n't tip vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero will get four more years the pp had also attacked zapatero for giving 600,000 illegal immigrants the opportunity to have their status “ regularized . ”
rajoy suggested that immigrants should sign an " integration contract " where they promise to respect spain 's laws and customs .
rosa caballero , an insurance worker in madrid , told afp that she was angry after the train bombings in 2004 .
her vote then was “ born of fury and indignation ” over the train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people .
islamist terrorists were responsible , although the pp originally blamed the basque separatist group eta .
caballero told afp she voted for the scialists again on sunday , as did her 19-year-old son , ruben , who said he was n't convinced by the pp arguments on the economy and immigration .
" the slowing of the economy is widespread across europe , " he said .
" immigrants are not a problem here .
they live here happily and more of them should be regularized . ”
socialists get boost from high turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy was unable to convince voters rajoy 's party traditionally enjoys stronger voter turnout among supporters than the socialists , whose voters tend to stay home .
voter turnout was expected to be slightly below the 76 percent in the 2004 elections , when voters turned out en masse to get rid of the ruling conservatives .
the high turnout in 2004 was caused by anger over the pp 's insistence on blaming the basque separatist group eta for deadly train bombings in madrid a few days before the vote .
early indications showed islamist radicals were responsible .
many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused then-pp prime minister jose maria aznar of deliberately misleading them .
basques stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta was blamed for friday 's assassination while voter turnout this time was relatively high , many basques stayed home .
only 53 percent of eligible voters in the basque country cast ballots , according to preliminary election figures .
that was well below the 75 percent turnout that was expected in the rest of spain .
on friday , a former socialist town council member was killed near the coastal city of san sebastian .
all parties immediately blamed the violent separatist group eta , which has been blamed for more than 800 death in spain during the past four decades .
eta has not claimed responsibility for the killing , although police say that it was typical of an eta-style political assassination .
isaias carrasco , who gave up his body guard when he did n't win re-election last fall , was shot outside his home .
eta supporters urged basques to boycott the elections .
" we must vote to teach the terrorists a lesson , " jose angel , a childhood friend of carrasco 's , said as he went to cast his ballot sunday .
" i hope people turn out to vote against everything that has happened .
carrasco 's 19-year-old daughter made an emotional appeal saturday for voters to turn out in large numbers to honor her father and " defeat eta . ”
eta seen as weak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote against eta eta says it wants independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
many spanish commentators felt friday 's assassination showed the group 's weakness and desperation .
zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta , which many felt gave the group legitimacy .
he abandoned them after eta killed two people with a car bomb in december 2006 .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta , which is considered a terrorist group by spain , the european union and the united states .
both parties have promised not to negotiate with eta . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the socialist party -lrb- psoe -rrb- is thought to have benefitted from high voter turnout two days after a basque politician 's murder shocked the country . socialists began celebrating their win soon after polls closed on sunday , march 9 .
" it is a great victory , " the socialist party 's secretary general , jose blanco , annnounced on television .
" it is a victory for all citizens . "
the party won 169 spots in the 350-seat lower house .
with nearly all votes from sunday 's election counted , zapatero 's socialist party had 44 percent , versus 40 percent for the conservative people 's party .
the result give the socialists a plurality , though they 're just shy of the outright 176-seat majority needed to govern alone .
zapatero had been hoping to end his reliance on the support of far-left and regionalist parties , which he has counted on during the past four years .
about 35 million people were eligible to elect the parliament as well as 208 of the 264 members of the senate .
conservatives sidelined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives had hoped for a comeback pio garcia escudero , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- campaign director , conceded defeat sunday night . " i congratulate the socialist party , " garcia escudero has told a press conference in madrid .
" it appears -lsb- their -rsb- victory is clear . "
the loss was a tough blow to the pp , lead by mariano rajoy .
the party seemed unsure during the campaign of how to best stop zapatero 's momentum .
since being elected in 2004 , the socialists have pushed through sweeping social changes , turning spain into one of europe 's most liberal countries on issues such as gay marriage .
zapatero has also sped up divorce , ended compulsory religious education and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants .
the economy was seen as the central theme in the elections , and the pp tried to convince voters it could best handle the economic challenges and keep the country prosperous .
spain 's economy has boomed in the past decade .
yet the annual growth rate could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
and spaniards have worried about unemployment as the country 's construction sector has stagnated .
economy , immigration do n't tip vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero will get four more years the pp had also attacked zapatero for giving 600,000 illegal immigrants the opportunity to have their status “ regularized . ”
rajoy suggested that immigrants should sign an " integration contract " where they promise to respect spain 's laws and customs .
rosa caballero , an insurance worker in madrid , told afp that she was angry after the train bombings in 2004 .
her vote then was “ born of fury and indignation ” over the train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people .
islamist terrorists were responsible , although the pp originally blamed the basque separatist group eta .
caballero told afp she voted for the scialists again on sunday , as did her 19-year-old son , ruben , who said he was n't convinced by the pp arguments on the economy and immigration .
" the slowing of the economy is widespread across europe , " he said .
" immigrants are not a problem here .
they live here happily and more of them should be regularized . ”
socialists get boost from high turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy was unable to convince voters rajoy 's party traditionally enjoys stronger voter turnout among supporters than the socialists , whose voters tend to stay home .
voter turnout was expected to be slightly below the 76 percent in the 2004 elections , when voters turned out en masse to get rid of the ruling conservatives .
the high turnout in 2004 was caused by anger over the pp 's insistence on blaming the basque separatist group eta for deadly train bombings in madrid a few days before the vote .
early indications showed islamist radicals were responsible .
many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused then-pp prime minister jose maria aznar of deliberately misleading them .
basques stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta was blamed for friday 's assassination while voter turnout this time was relatively high , many basques stayed home .
only 53 percent of eligible voters in the basque country cast ballots , according to preliminary election figures .
that was well below the 75 percent turnout that was expected in the rest of spain .
on friday , a former socialist town council member was killed near the coastal city of san sebastian .
all parties immediately blamed the violent separatist group eta , which has been blamed for more than 800 death in spain during the past four decades .
eta has not claimed responsibility for the killing , although police say that it was typical of an eta-style political assassination .
isaias carrasco , who gave up his body guard when he did n't win re-election last fall , was shot outside his home .
eta supporters urged basques to boycott the elections .
" we must vote to teach the terrorists a lesson , " jose angel , a childhood friend of carrasco 's , said as he went to cast his ballot sunday .
" i hope people turn out to vote against everything that has happened .

the socialist party -lrb- psoe -rrb- is thought to have benefitted from high voter turnout two days after a basque politician 's murder shocked the country . socialists began celebrating their win soon after polls closed on sunday , march 9 .
" it is a great victory , " the socialist party 's secretary general , jose blanco , annnounced on television .
" it is a victory for all citizens . "
the party won 169 spots in the 350-seat lower house .
with nearly all votes from sunday 's election counted , zapatero 's socialist party had 44 percent , versus 40 percent for the conservative people 's party .
the result give the socialists a plurality , though they 're just shy of the outright 176-seat majority needed to govern alone .
zapatero had been hoping to end his reliance on the support of far-left and regionalist parties , which he has counted on during the past four years .
about 35 million people were eligible to elect the parliament as well as 208 of the 264 members of the senate .
conservatives sidelined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives had hoped for a comeback pio garcia escudero , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- campaign director , conceded defeat sunday night . " i congratulate the socialist party , " garcia escudero has told a press conference in madrid .
" it appears -lsb- their -rsb- victory is clear . "
the loss was a tough blow to the pp , lead by mariano rajoy .
the party seemed unsure during the campaign of how to best stop zapatero 's momentum .
since being elected in 2004 , the socialists have pushed through sweeping social changes , turning spain into one of europe 's most liberal countries on issues such as gay marriage .
zapatero has also sped up divorce , ended compulsory religious education and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants .
the economy was seen as the central theme in the elections , and the pp tried to convince voters it could best handle the economic challenges and keep the country prosperous .
spain 's economy has boomed in the past decade .
yet the annual growth rate could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
and spaniards have worried about unemployment as the country 's construction sector has stagnated .
economy , immigration do n't tip vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero will get four more years the pp had also attacked zapatero for giving 600,000 illegal immigrants the opportunity to have their status “ regularized . ”
rajoy suggested that immigrants should sign an " integration contract " where they promise to respect spain 's laws and customs .
rosa caballero , an insurance worker in madrid , told afp that she was angry after the train bombings in 2004 .
her vote then was “ born of fury and indignation ” over the train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people .
islamist terrorists were responsible , although the pp originally blamed the basque separatist group eta .
caballero told afp she voted for the scialists again on sunday , as did her 19-year-old son , ruben , who said he was n't convinced by the pp arguments on the economy and immigration .
" the slowing of the economy is widespread across europe , " he said .
" immigrants are not a problem here .
they live here happily and more of them should be regularized . ”
socialists get boost from high turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy was unable to convince voters rajoy 's party traditionally enjoys stronger voter turnout among supporters than the socialists , whose voters tend to stay home .
voter turnout was expected to be slightly below the 76 percent in the 2004 elections , when voters turned out en masse to get rid of the ruling conservatives .
the high turnout in 2004 was caused by anger over the pp 's insistence on blaming the basque separatist group eta for deadly train bombings in madrid a few days before the vote .
early indications showed islamist radicals were responsible .
many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused then-pp prime minister jose maria aznar of deliberately misleading them .
basques stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta was blamed for friday 's assassination while voter turnout this time was relatively high , many basques stayed home .
only 53 percent of eligible voters in the basque country cast ballots , according to preliminary election figures .
that was well below the 75 percent turnout that was expected in the rest of spain .
on friday , a former socialist town council member was killed near the coastal city of san sebastian .
all parties immediately blamed the violent separatist group eta , which has been blamed for more than 800 death in spain during the past four decades .
eta has not claimed responsibility for the killing , although police say that it was typical of an eta-style political assassination .
isaias carrasco , who gave up his body guard when he did n't win re-election last fall , was shot outside his home .
eta supporters urged basques to boycott the elections .
" we must vote to teach the terrorists a lesson , " jose angel , a childhood friend of carrasco 's , said as he went to cast his ballot sunday .
" i hope people turn out to vote against everything that has happened .
carrasco 's 19-year-old daughter made an emotional appeal saturday for voters to turn out in large numbers to honor her father and " defeat eta . ”
eta seen as weak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote against eta eta says it wants independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
many spanish commentators felt friday 's assassination showed the group 's weakness and desperation .
zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta , which many felt gave the group legitimacy .
he abandoned them after eta killed two people with a car bomb in december 2006 .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta , which is considered a terrorist group by spain , the european union and the united states .
both parties have promised not to negotiate with eta . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

zapatero has said the shooting was an attempt by eta to interfere with the elections .
" but spanish democracy has demonstrated that it does not allow challenges from those who oppose its basic principles and its most essential values , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carrasco was shot dead in front of his family the killing of a former socialist councillor in the basque country has cast a heavy pall on sunday 's voting .
the socialist government and conservative opposition have blamed basque guerrillas of eta for friday 's shooting of isaias carrasco who was assassinated in front of his wife and young daughter outside his house in a small town near the basque coastal city of san sebastian .
zapatero has said the shooting was an attempt by eta to interfere with the elections .
" but spanish democracy has demonstrated that it does not allow challenges from those who oppose its basic principles and its most essential values , " he said .
murder reminiscent of madrid bombings the timing of the latest killing has stirred memories of an election-eve massacre by islamic militants who killed 191 people in a string of bombings against commuter trains in madrid in march 2004 .
at the time , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- led by then prime minister jose maria aznar seemed almost certain to win for the third consecutive term during the last national elections in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's last general election was marked by carnage but anger at the conservative government 's attempts to blame those bombings on eta , despite mounting evidence that it was the work of islamists , helped opposition leader zapatero to come from behind to win the elections . many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused aznar of deliberately misleading them .
the latest murder is not expected by many to have a huge impact on the vote both of its small scale and the fact that the two main parties hold relatively similar positions on not negotiating with eta .
eta has killed 820 people in spain during the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero has been under fire for his approach to eta zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .

economy remains the key spain 's economy has had among the fastest growth rates in europe during recent years , with 500,000 jobs created annually .

the socialist party -lrb- psoe -rrb- is thought to have benefitted from high voter turnout two days after a basque politician 's murder shocked the country . socialists began celebrating their win soon after polls closed on sunday , march 9 .
" it is a great victory , " the socialist party 's secretary general , jose blanco , annnounced on television .
" it is a victory for all citizens . "
the party won 169 spots in the 350-seat lower house .
with nearly all votes from sunday 's election counted , zapatero 's socialist party had 44 percent , versus 40 percent for the conservative people 's party .
the result give the socialists a plurality , though they 're just shy of the outright 176-seat majority needed to govern alone .
zapatero had been hoping to end his reliance on the support of far-left and regionalist parties , which he has counted on during the past four years .
about 35 million people were eligible to elect the parliament as well as 208 of the 264 members of the senate .
conservatives sidelined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives had hoped for a comeback pio garcia escudero , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- campaign director , conceded defeat sunday night . " i congratulate the socialist party , " garcia escudero has told a press conference in madrid .
" it appears -lsb- their -rsb- victory is clear . "
the loss was a tough blow to the pp , lead by mariano rajoy .
the party seemed unsure during the campaign of how to best stop zapatero 's momentum .
since being elected in 2004 , the socialists have pushed through sweeping social changes , turning spain into one of europe 's most liberal countries on issues such as gay marriage .
zapatero has also sped up divorce , ended compulsory religious education and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants .
the economy was seen as the central theme in the elections , and the pp tried to convince voters it could best handle the economic challenges and keep the country prosperous .
spain 's economy has boomed in the past decade .
yet the annual growth rate could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
and spaniards have worried about unemployment as the country 's construction sector has stagnated .
economy , immigration do n't tip vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero will get four more years the pp had also attacked zapatero for giving 600,000 illegal immigrants the opportunity to have their status “ regularized . ”
rajoy suggested that immigrants should sign an " integration contract " where they promise to respect spain 's laws and customs .
rosa caballero , an insurance worker in madrid , told afp that she was angry after the train bombings in 2004 .
her vote then was “ born of fury and indignation ” over the train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people .
islamist terrorists were responsible , although the pp originally blamed the basque separatist group eta .
caballero told afp she voted for the scialists again on sunday , as did her 19-year-old son , ruben , who said he was n't convinced by the pp arguments on the economy and immigration .
" the slowing of the economy is widespread across europe , " he said .
" immigrants are not a problem here .
they live here happily and more of them should be regularized . ”
socialists get boost from high turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy was unable to convince voters rajoy 's party traditionally enjoys stronger voter turnout among supporters than the socialists , whose voters tend to stay home .
voter turnout was expected to be slightly below the 76 percent in the 2004 elections , when voters turned out en masse to get rid of the ruling conservatives .
the high turnout in 2004 was caused by anger over the pp 's insistence on blaming the basque separatist group eta for deadly train bombings in madrid a few days before the vote .
early indications showed islamist radicals were responsible .
many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused then-pp prime minister jose maria aznar of deliberately misleading them .
basques stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta was blamed for friday 's assassination while voter turnout this time was relatively high , many basques stayed home .
only 53 percent of eligible voters in the basque country cast ballots , according to preliminary election figures .
that was well below the 75 percent turnout that was expected in the rest of spain .
on friday , a former socialist town council member was killed near the coastal city of san sebastian .
all parties immediately blamed the violent separatist group eta , which has been blamed for more than 800 death in spain during the past four decades .
eta has not claimed responsibility for the killing , although police say that it was typical of an eta-style political assassination .
isaias carrasco , who gave up his body guard when he did n't win re-election last fall , was shot outside his home .
eta supporters urged basques to boycott the elections .
" we must vote to teach the terrorists a lesson , " jose angel , a childhood friend of carrasco 's , said as he went to cast his ballot sunday .
" i hope people turn out to vote against everything that has happened .
carrasco 's 19-year-old daughter made an emotional appeal saturday for voters to turn out in large numbers to honor her father and " defeat eta . ”
eta seen as weak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote against eta eta says it wants independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
many spanish commentators felt friday 's assassination showed the group 's weakness and desperation .
zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta , which many felt gave the group legitimacy .
he abandoned them after eta killed two people with a car bomb in december 2006 .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta , which is considered a terrorist group by spain , the european union and the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 09.03.2008 germany 's middle classes shrinking , study warns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's poor are n't just getting poorer , their numbers are rising too germany 's recent economic upswing is bypassing the middle classes , according to an economic research institute .
globalization and greater flexibility in the labor market are widening the gap between rich and poor . forbes magazine ranked 87-year-old karl albrecht , owner of the aldi discounter chain , as number 10 of the world 's richest people .
his wealth has been estimated at $ 27 billion -lrb- 17.7 billion euros -rrb- . albrecht has built his empire on providing food and clothing at knock-down prices to a chain of stores across europe .
but he might soon be losing most of his middle-income customers in germany as the country counts the cost of income inequality . joachim frick from the diw research institute blamed the hartz iv social benefit cutbacks and other social reforms introduced under former chancellor gerhard schröder as the main culprit . " long-term unemployment and more flexible and temporary working patterns have had an negative effect on the middle classes , " said frick . gap between rich and poor widening the german middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate according to a diw report , presenting a challenge to europe 's largest economy . the berlin-based diw research institute said the sharpest fall has been recorded in the number of " average earners " - that 's the group with an income of between 90 percent and 110 percent of the median income - who saw their income drop five percent .
the median income has been set at 16,200 euros , according to equivalized disposable income , and those under 11,340 euro are considered as living in poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can i afford this ?
in 1992 , more than 49 million belonged to the middle class and this figure , representing 62 percent of germany 's total population , remained constant until the end of the 20th century . by 2006 , the number of people in the middle class , dropped to 54 percent , or 44 million people , according to the study by the diw research institute . diw said the rich have become richer and the poor not only poorer but have also gained in size . " there is a bigger concentration on both ends of the scale , " the research institute said in a statement . " the incomes of those in the upper half of society grew faster than those in the lower half , which means that inequalities on the income scale grew , " it said . traditional families hard hit flexible labor patterns are also taking their toll : temporary jobs , part-time work , those self-employed who are dependent on one employer and so-called " one-euro jobs " for those receiving social security benefits . the study said that more than 11 percent had managed to move up to the upper income bracket .
at the other end of the scale , people on lower incomes - those with 70 percent less than the median - have increased significantly since 2000 to 25 percent of the german population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional families have been hard hit by the reforms one of the main casualties have been traditional families.the decline in the number of middle income families with children under the age of 16 has fallen by three million in 2006 .
but also one million people living in multi-generational households have seen their income fall into lower income bracket . economic upswing faltering germany has emerged from a period of stagnation to experience a mini-economic miracle over the last two years , largely thanks to stronger exports .
but a stronger euro , coupled with rising labor costs and energy prices have dented the economic upswing . the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast for the third time in less than a year to 1.7 percent from 2 percent .
economy minister michael glos said the revision amounted to an appeal to avoid excessive wage accords . corporate profits from 2002-2006 have increased by roughly a third , however , compared to workers ' salaries according to the federal statistics office . the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- said real take-home pay had declined 3.5 per cent for salaried employees since the upswing began in the last quarter of 2004 . the federal statistical office -lrb- destatis -rrb- in a recent study said that just under 13 percent of the population in germany were at risk of poverty .
according to the eu definition , the at-risk-of-poverty rate is the share of persons having to manage on less than 60 percent of their mean income of the entire population . that 's nearly 11 million , including 1.7 million children .
that 's less than most of the eu 's 27 member countries with only scandanavian countries achieving better results .

globalization and greater flexibility in the labor market are widening the gap between rich and poor . forbes magazine ranked 87-year-old karl albrecht , owner of the aldi discounter chain , as number 10 of the world 's richest people .
his wealth has been estimated at $ 27 billion -lrb- 17.7 billion euros -rrb- . albrecht has built his empire on providing food and clothing at knock-down prices to a chain of stores across europe .
but he might soon be losing most of his middle-income customers in germany as the country counts the cost of income inequality . joachim frick from the diw research institute blamed the hartz iv social benefit cutbacks and other social reforms introduced under former chancellor gerhard schröder as the main culprit . " long-term unemployment and more flexible and temporary working patterns have had an negative effect on the middle classes , " said frick . gap between rich and poor widening the german middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate according to a diw report , presenting a challenge to europe 's largest economy . the berlin-based diw research institute said the sharpest fall has been recorded in the number of " average earners " - that 's the group with an income of between 90 percent and 110 percent of the median income - who saw their income drop five percent .
the median income has been set at 16,200 euros , according to equivalized disposable income , and those under 11,340 euro are considered as living in poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can i afford this ?
in 1992 , more than 49 million belonged to the middle class and this figure , representing 62 percent of germany 's total population , remained constant until the end of the 20th century . by 2006 , the number of people in the middle class , dropped to 54 percent , or 44 million people , according to the study by the diw research institute . diw said the rich have become richer and the poor not only poorer but have also gained in size . " there is a bigger concentration on both ends of the scale , " the research institute said in a statement . " the incomes of those in the upper half of society grew faster than those in the lower half , which means that inequalities on the income scale grew , " it said . traditional families hard hit flexible labor patterns are also taking their toll : temporary jobs , part-time work , those self-employed who are dependent on one employer and so-called " one-euro jobs " for those receiving social security benefits . the study said that more than 11 percent had managed to move up to the upper income bracket .
at the other end of the scale , people on lower incomes - those with 70 percent less than the median - have increased significantly since 2000 to 25 percent of the german population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional families have been hard hit by the reforms one of the main casualties have been traditional families.the decline in the number of middle income families with children under the age of 16 has fallen by three million in 2006 .
but also one million people living in multi-generational households have seen their income fall into lower income bracket . economic upswing faltering germany has emerged from a period of stagnation to experience a mini-economic miracle over the last two years , largely thanks to stronger exports .
but a stronger euro , coupled with rising labor costs and energy prices have dented the economic upswing . the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast for the third time in less than a year to 1.7 percent from 2 percent .
economy minister michael glos said the revision amounted to an appeal to avoid excessive wage accords . corporate profits from 2002-2006 have increased by roughly a third , however , compared to workers ' salaries according to the federal statistics office . the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- said real take-home pay had declined 3.5 per cent for salaried employees since the upswing began in the last quarter of 2004 . the federal statistical office -lrb- destatis -rrb- in a recent study said that just under 13 percent of the population in germany were at risk of poverty .
according to the eu definition , the at-risk-of-poverty rate is the share of persons having to manage on less than 60 percent of their mean income of the entire population . that 's nearly 11 million , including 1.7 million children .

the socialist party -lrb- psoe -rrb- is thought to have benefitted from high voter turnout two days after a basque politician 's murder shocked the country . socialists began celebrating their win soon after polls closed on sunday , march 9 .
" it is a great victory , " the socialist party 's secretary general , jose blanco , annnounced on television .
" it is a victory for all citizens . "
the party won 169 spots in the 350-seat lower house .
with nearly all votes from sunday 's election counted , zapatero 's socialist party had 44 percent , versus 40 percent for the conservative people 's party .
the result give the socialists a plurality , though they 're just shy of the outright 176-seat majority needed to govern alone .
zapatero had been hoping to end his reliance on the support of far-left and regionalist parties , which he has counted on during the past four years .
about 35 million people were eligible to elect the parliament as well as 208 of the 264 members of the senate .
conservatives sidelined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives had hoped for a comeback pio garcia escudero , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- campaign director , conceded defeat sunday night . " i congratulate the socialist party , " garcia escudero has told a press conference in madrid .
" it appears -lsb- their -rsb- victory is clear . "
the loss was a tough blow to the pp , lead by mariano rajoy .
the party seemed unsure during the campaign of how to best stop zapatero 's momentum .
since being elected in 2004 , the socialists have pushed through sweeping social changes , turning spain into one of europe 's most liberal countries on issues such as gay marriage .
zapatero has also sped up divorce , ended compulsory religious education and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants .
the economy was seen as the central theme in the elections , and the pp tried to convince voters it could best handle the economic challenges and keep the country prosperous .
spain 's economy has boomed in the past decade .
yet the annual growth rate could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
and spaniards have worried about unemployment as the country 's construction sector has stagnated .
economy , immigration do n't tip vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero will get four more years the pp had also attacked zapatero for giving 600,000 illegal immigrants the opportunity to have their status “ regularized . ”
rajoy suggested that immigrants should sign an " integration contract " where they promise to respect spain 's laws and customs .
rosa caballero , an insurance worker in madrid , told afp that she was angry after the train bombings in 2004 .
her vote then was “ born of fury and indignation ” over the train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people .
islamist terrorists were responsible , although the pp originally blamed the basque separatist group eta .
caballero told afp she voted for the scialists again on sunday , as did her 19-year-old son , ruben , who said he was n't convinced by the pp arguments on the economy and immigration .
" the slowing of the economy is widespread across europe , " he said .
" immigrants are not a problem here .
they live here happily and more of them should be regularized . ”
socialists get boost from high turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy was unable to convince voters rajoy 's party traditionally enjoys stronger voter turnout among supporters than the socialists , whose voters tend to stay home .
voter turnout was expected to be slightly below the 76 percent in the 2004 elections , when voters turned out en masse to get rid of the ruling conservatives .
the high turnout in 2004 was caused by anger over the pp 's insistence on blaming the basque separatist group eta for deadly train bombings in madrid a few days before the vote .
early indications showed islamist radicals were responsible .
many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused then-pp prime minister jose maria aznar of deliberately misleading them .
basques stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta was blamed for friday 's assassination while voter turnout this time was relatively high , many basques stayed home .
only 53 percent of eligible voters in the basque country cast ballots , according to preliminary election figures .
that was well below the 75 percent turnout that was expected in the rest of spain .
on friday , a former socialist town council member was killed near the coastal city of san sebastian .
all parties immediately blamed the violent separatist group eta , which has been blamed for more than 800 death in spain during the past four decades .
eta has not claimed responsibility for the killing , although police say that it was typical of an eta-style political assassination .
isaias carrasco , who gave up his body guard when he did n't win re-election last fall , was shot outside his home .
eta supporters urged basques to boycott the elections .
" we must vote to teach the terrorists a lesson , " jose angel , a childhood friend of carrasco 's , said as he went to cast his ballot sunday .
" i hope people turn out to vote against everything that has happened .
carrasco 's 19-year-old daughter made an emotional appeal saturday for voters to turn out in large numbers to honor her father and " defeat eta . ”
eta seen as weak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote against eta eta says it wants independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
many spanish commentators felt friday 's assassination showed the group 's weakness and desperation .
zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta , which many felt gave the group legitimacy .
he abandoned them after eta killed two people with a car bomb in december 2006 .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta , which is considered a terrorist group by spain , the european union and the united states .

he opened the antstore , a shop selling 60 species of the insect and all the accessories needed to set up a successful farm . now business is , if not booming , at least crawling along nicely . watching an ant colony can be a heady , even eerie , experience .
it offers a god 's-eye view ; a rare chance for a person to take in an entire , seething , struggling society at a glance . so it may be the philosophical-existential quality of ant-farming that attracts people to the antstore , which computer programmer martin sebesta opened some five years ago in berlin . or , it could be that people are increasingly looking for low-maintainance pets .
ants are easy to feed , suited to apartment life , and don ’ t shed or run up pricey vet bills . whatever the reason , anyone looking for a particular kind of ant has a good chance of finding it at the antstore .
the shop deals in over 60 types of the insect - mostly exotic breeds , from india , south america , australia and japan , among others . sebesta doesn ’ t only sell ant colonies and farms to walk-in customers .
he has a europe-wide internet mail-order business , and also provides creepy-crawlies for film and tv productions .
he even helped set up a zoo exhibit . for beginners , sebesta recommends weaver ants as being easy to care for .
a colony can live on in an apartment on an island set within a plastic tub of water - although “ you have to be careful that they don ’ t use their larvae to build a bridge over the water and crawl out , ” he warns . some breeds , like south american leaf cutters , may be more dramatic , but sebesta recomments them for experienced ant-farmers , as they need a lot of space .
likewise , bulldog ants – long , thin predatory insects that subsist only on living prey – are best kept by people experienced in the care of exotic animals . “ bulldog ants can see prey up to four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- away , ” sebesta said .

he opened the antstore , a shop selling 60 species of the insect and all the accessories needed to set up a successful farm . now business is , if not booming , at least crawling along nicely . watching an ant colony can be a heady , even eerie , experience .
it offers a god 's-eye view ; a rare chance for a person to take in an entire , seething , struggling society at a glance . so it may be the philosophical-existential quality of ant-farming that attracts people to the antstore , which computer programmer martin sebesta opened some five years ago in berlin . or , it could be that people are increasingly looking for low-maintainance pets .
ants are easy to feed , suited to apartment life , and don ’ t shed or run up pricey vet bills . whatever the reason , anyone looking for a particular kind of ant has a good chance of finding it at the antstore .
the shop deals in over 60 types of the insect - mostly exotic breeds , from india , south america , australia and japan , among others . sebesta doesn ’ t only sell ant colonies and farms to walk-in customers .
he has a europe-wide internet mail-order business , and also provides creepy-crawlies for film and tv productions .
he even helped set up a zoo exhibit . for beginners , sebesta recommends weaver ants as being easy to care for .
a colony can live on in an apartment on an island set within a plastic tub of water - although “ you have to be careful that they don ’ t use their larvae to build a bridge over the water and crawl out , ” he warns . some breeds , like south american leaf cutters , may be more dramatic , but sebesta recomments them for experienced ant-farmers , as they need a lot of space .
likewise , bulldog ants – long , thin predatory insects that subsist only on living prey – are best kept by people experienced in the care of exotic animals . “ bulldog ants can see prey up to four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- away , ” sebesta said .
“ you can even see them turn their head to watch you when you walk by . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carrasco was shot dead in front of his family the killing of a former socialist councillor in the basque country has cast a heavy pall on sunday 's voting .
the socialist government and conservative opposition have blamed basque guerrillas of eta for friday 's shooting of isaias carrasco who was assassinated in front of his wife and young daughter outside his house in a small town near the basque coastal city of san sebastian .
zapatero has said the shooting was an attempt by eta to interfere with the elections .
" but spanish democracy has demonstrated that it does not allow challenges from those who oppose its basic principles and its most essential values , " he said .
murder reminiscent of madrid bombings the timing of the latest killing has stirred memories of an election-eve massacre by islamic militants who killed 191 people in a string of bombings against commuter trains in madrid in march 2004 .
at the time , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- led by then prime minister jose maria aznar seemed almost certain to win for the third consecutive term during the last national elections in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's last general election was marked by carnage but anger at the conservative government 's attempts to blame those bombings on eta , despite mounting evidence that it was the work of islamists , helped opposition leader zapatero to come from behind to win the elections . many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused aznar of deliberately misleading them .
the latest murder is not expected by many to have a huge impact on the vote both of its small scale and the fact that the two main parties hold relatively similar positions on not negotiating with eta .
eta has killed 820 people in spain during the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero has been under fire for his approach to eta zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta .
in statement read on television friday , mariano rajoy of the conservative pp urged spaniards to " be united against eta , " which should now lose " all hope of achieving its political objectives . "
this time , voters remain more worried about the cooling economy as spaniards struggle with rising unemployment , currently at 2.3 million .
economy remains the key spain 's economy has had among the fastest growth rates in europe during recent years , with 500,000 jobs created annually .
yet indications show that the country 's building boom is coming to an end and growth slowed to 3.8 percent in 2007 .
while the government has a surplus to fall back on , many spaniards , fearing an economic crisis , have put off purchases .
that in turn has caused retail sales and industrial production to taper off .
the job market has shown signs of shrinking , food prices have increased and growth could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
yet many voters find the economic plans of the ruling socialist party , led by jose luis rodrigo zapatero , and his center-right challenger , mariano rajoy of the pp to be nearly indistinguishable .
bitter , populist campaign a bitterly fought campaign marked by nasty personal attacks between the ruling socialist party and the pp has turned off many voters . during their last televised debate , zapatero and rajoy clashed over anti- terrorism policy , immigration and the outlook for the spanish economy , continuously called each other " liars . "
populist rhetoric has dominated the campaign , with the socialists pledging social spending and the pp promising to make immigrants respect spanish customs and to fight juvenile crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy has lashed out at zapatero over his immigration policies rajoy has confronted zapatero 's decision to offer residence permits to more than half a million illegal immigrants who were working in spain when he came to power .
rajoy said the influx of foreigners was leaving many poorer spaniards worse off and jeopardizing public security .
he pledged to expel any immigrant convicted of a crime .
the parties have also fallen over themselves promising lower taxes , higher pensions , free dental care and cheaper mortgages .
both parties need to win not only the support of swing voters but also motivate their supporters to go to the polls in large numbers in order to win the elections .
with the parties close , the winner could have to rely on the support of smaller parties to form a government .
zapatero has been in a thorny alliance with the separatist republican left of catalonia -lrb- erc -rrb- and the united left , a coalition of greens and communists .

zapatero 's government pushed through fast-track divorces , legalized gay marriage and adoption , granted amnesty to many illegal immigrants and ended compulsory religious education in schools .

the socialist party -lrb- psoe -rrb- is thought to have benefitted from high voter turnout two days after a basque politician 's murder shocked the country . socialists began celebrating their win soon after polls closed on sunday , march 9 .
" it is a great victory , " the socialist party 's secretary general , jose blanco , annnounced on television .
" it is a victory for all citizens . "
the party won 169 spots in the 350-seat lower house .
with nearly all votes from sunday 's election counted , zapatero 's socialist party had 44 percent , versus 40 percent for the conservative people 's party .
the result give the socialists a plurality , though they 're just shy of the outright 176-seat majority needed to govern alone .
zapatero had been hoping to end his reliance on the support of far-left and regionalist parties , which he has counted on during the past four years .
about 35 million people were eligible to elect the parliament as well as 208 of the 264 members of the senate .
conservatives sidelined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives had hoped for a comeback pio garcia escudero , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- campaign director , conceded defeat sunday night . " i congratulate the socialist party , " garcia escudero has told a press conference in madrid .
" it appears -lsb- their -rsb- victory is clear . "
the loss was a tough blow to the pp , lead by mariano rajoy .
the party seemed unsure during the campaign of how to best stop zapatero 's momentum .
since being elected in 2004 , the socialists have pushed through sweeping social changes , turning spain into one of europe 's most liberal countries on issues such as gay marriage .
zapatero has also sped up divorce , ended compulsory religious education and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants .
the economy was seen as the central theme in the elections , and the pp tried to convince voters it could best handle the economic challenges and keep the country prosperous .
spain 's economy has boomed in the past decade .
yet the annual growth rate could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
and spaniards have worried about unemployment as the country 's construction sector has stagnated .
economy , immigration do n't tip vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero will get four more years the pp had also attacked zapatero for giving 600,000 illegal immigrants the opportunity to have their status “ regularized . ”
rajoy suggested that immigrants should sign an " integration contract " where they promise to respect spain 's laws and customs .
rosa caballero , an insurance worker in madrid , told afp that she was angry after the train bombings in 2004 .
her vote then was “ born of fury and indignation ” over the train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people .
islamist terrorists were responsible , although the pp originally blamed the basque separatist group eta .
caballero told afp she voted for the scialists again on sunday , as did her 19-year-old son , ruben , who said he was n't convinced by the pp arguments on the economy and immigration .
" the slowing of the economy is widespread across europe , " he said .
" immigrants are not a problem here .
they live here happily and more of them should be regularized . ”
socialists get boost from high turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy was unable to convince voters rajoy 's party traditionally enjoys stronger voter turnout among supporters than the socialists , whose voters tend to stay home .
voter turnout was expected to be slightly below the 76 percent in the 2004 elections , when voters turned out en masse to get rid of the ruling conservatives .
the high turnout in 2004 was caused by anger over the pp 's insistence on blaming the basque separatist group eta for deadly train bombings in madrid a few days before the vote .
early indications showed islamist radicals were responsible .
many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused then-pp prime minister jose maria aznar of deliberately misleading them .
basques stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta was blamed for friday 's assassination while voter turnout this time was relatively high , many basques stayed home .
only 53 percent of eligible voters in the basque country cast ballots , according to preliminary election figures .
that was well below the 75 percent turnout that was expected in the rest of spain .
on friday , a former socialist town council member was killed near the coastal city of san sebastian .
all parties immediately blamed the violent separatist group eta , which has been blamed for more than 800 death in spain during the past four decades .
eta has not claimed responsibility for the killing , although police say that it was typical of an eta-style political assassination .
isaias carrasco , who gave up his body guard when he did n't win re-election last fall , was shot outside his home .
eta supporters urged basques to boycott the elections .
" we must vote to teach the terrorists a lesson , " jose angel , a childhood friend of carrasco 's , said as he went to cast his ballot sunday .
" i hope people turn out to vote against everything that has happened .
carrasco 's 19-year-old daughter made an emotional appeal saturday for voters to turn out in large numbers to honor her father and " defeat eta . ”
eta seen as weak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote against eta eta says it wants independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
many spanish commentators felt friday 's assassination showed the group 's weakness and desperation .
zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta , which many felt gave the group legitimacy .

the socialist party -lrb- psoe -rrb- is thought to have benefitted from high voter turnout two days after a basque politician 's murder shocked the country . socialists began celebrating their win soon after polls closed on sunday , march 9 .
" it is a great victory , " the socialist party 's secretary general , jose blanco , annnounced on television .
" it is a victory for all citizens . "
the party won 169 spots in the 350-seat lower house .
with nearly all votes from sunday 's election counted , zapatero 's socialist party had 44 percent , versus 40 percent for the conservative people 's party .
the result give the socialists a plurality , though they 're just shy of the outright 176-seat majority needed to govern alone .
zapatero had been hoping to end his reliance on the support of far-left and regionalist parties , which he has counted on during the past four years .
about 35 million people were eligible to elect the parliament as well as 208 of the 264 members of the senate .
conservatives sidelined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives had hoped for a comeback pio garcia escudero , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- campaign director , conceded defeat sunday night . " i congratulate the socialist party , " garcia escudero has told a press conference in madrid .
" it appears -lsb- their -rsb- victory is clear . "
the loss was a tough blow to the pp , lead by mariano rajoy .
the party seemed unsure during the campaign of how to best stop zapatero 's momentum .
since being elected in 2004 , the socialists have pushed through sweeping social changes , turning spain into one of europe 's most liberal countries on issues such as gay marriage .
zapatero has also sped up divorce , ended compulsory religious education and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants .
the economy was seen as the central theme in the elections , and the pp tried to convince voters it could best handle the economic challenges and keep the country prosperous .
spain 's economy has boomed in the past decade .
yet the annual growth rate could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
and spaniards have worried about unemployment as the country 's construction sector has stagnated .
economy , immigration do n't tip vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero will get four more years the pp had also attacked zapatero for giving 600,000 illegal immigrants the opportunity to have their status “ regularized . ”
rajoy suggested that immigrants should sign an " integration contract " where they promise to respect spain 's laws and customs .
rosa caballero , an insurance worker in madrid , told afp that she was angry after the train bombings in 2004 .
her vote then was “ born of fury and indignation ” over the train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people .
islamist terrorists were responsible , although the pp originally blamed the basque separatist group eta .
caballero told afp she voted for the scialists again on sunday , as did her 19-year-old son , ruben , who said he was n't convinced by the pp arguments on the economy and immigration .
" the slowing of the economy is widespread across europe , " he said .
" immigrants are not a problem here .
they live here happily and more of them should be regularized . ”
socialists get boost from high turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy was unable to convince voters rajoy 's party traditionally enjoys stronger voter turnout among supporters than the socialists , whose voters tend to stay home .
voter turnout was expected to be slightly below the 76 percent in the 2004 elections , when voters turned out en masse to get rid of the ruling conservatives .
the high turnout in 2004 was caused by anger over the pp 's insistence on blaming the basque separatist group eta for deadly train bombings in madrid a few days before the vote .
early indications showed islamist radicals were responsible .
many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused then-pp prime minister jose maria aznar of deliberately misleading them .
basques stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta was blamed for friday 's assassination while voter turnout this time was relatively high , many basques stayed home .
only 53 percent of eligible voters in the basque country cast ballots , according to preliminary election figures .
that was well below the 75 percent turnout that was expected in the rest of spain .
on friday , a former socialist town council member was killed near the coastal city of san sebastian .
all parties immediately blamed the violent separatist group eta , which has been blamed for more than 800 death in spain during the past four decades .
eta has not claimed responsibility for the killing , although police say that it was typical of an eta-style political assassination .
isaias carrasco , who gave up his body guard when he did n't win re-election last fall , was shot outside his home .
eta supporters urged basques to boycott the elections .
" we must vote to teach the terrorists a lesson , " jose angel , a childhood friend of carrasco 's , said as he went to cast his ballot sunday .
" i hope people turn out to vote against everything that has happened .
carrasco 's 19-year-old daughter made an emotional appeal saturday for voters to turn out in large numbers to honor her father and " defeat eta . ”
eta seen as weak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote against eta eta says it wants independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
many spanish commentators felt friday 's assassination showed the group 's weakness and desperation .
zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta , which many felt gave the group legitimacy .
he abandoned them after eta killed two people with a car bomb in december 2006 .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta , which is considered a terrorist group by spain , the european union and the united states .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carrasco was shot dead in front of his family the killing of a former socialist councillor in the basque country has cast a heavy pall on sunday 's voting .
the socialist government and conservative opposition have blamed basque guerrillas of eta for friday 's shooting of isaias carrasco who was assassinated in front of his wife and young daughter outside his house in a small town near the basque coastal city of san sebastian .
zapatero has said the shooting was an attempt by eta to interfere with the elections .
" but spanish democracy has demonstrated that it does not allow challenges from those who oppose its basic principles and its most essential values , " he said .
murder reminiscent of madrid bombings the timing of the latest killing has stirred memories of an election-eve massacre by islamic militants who killed 191 people in a string of bombings against commuter trains in madrid in march 2004 .
at the time , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- led by then prime minister jose maria aznar seemed almost certain to win for the third consecutive term during the last national elections in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's last general election was marked by carnage but anger at the conservative government 's attempts to blame those bombings on eta , despite mounting evidence that it was the work of islamists , helped opposition leader zapatero to come from behind to win the elections . many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused aznar of deliberately misleading them .
the latest murder is not expected by many to have a huge impact on the vote both of its small scale and the fact that the two main parties hold relatively similar positions on not negotiating with eta .
eta has killed 820 people in spain during the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .

he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta .
in statement read on television friday , mariano rajoy of the conservative pp urged spaniards to " be united against eta , " which should now lose " all hope of achieving its political objectives . "
this time , voters remain more worried about the cooling economy as spaniards struggle with rising unemployment , currently at 2.3 million .
economy remains the key spain 's economy has had among the fastest growth rates in europe during recent years , with 500,000 jobs created annually .
yet indications show that the country 's building boom is coming to an end and growth slowed to 3.8 percent in 2007 .
while the government has a surplus to fall back on , many spaniards , fearing an economic crisis , have put off purchases .
that in turn has caused retail sales and industrial production to taper off .
the job market has shown signs of shrinking , food prices have increased and growth could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
yet many voters find the economic plans of the ruling socialist party , led by jose luis rodrigo zapatero , and his center-right challenger , mariano rajoy of the pp to be nearly indistinguishable .
bitter , populist campaign a bitterly fought campaign marked by nasty personal attacks between the ruling socialist party and the pp has turned off many voters . during their last televised debate , zapatero and rajoy clashed over anti- terrorism policy , immigration and the outlook for the spanish economy , continuously called each other " liars . "
populist rhetoric has dominated the campaign , with the socialists pledging social spending and the pp promising to make immigrants respect spanish customs and to fight juvenile crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy has lashed out at zapatero over his immigration policies rajoy has confronted zapatero 's decision to offer residence permits to more than half a million illegal immigrants who were working in spain when he came to power .
rajoy said the influx of foreigners was leaving many poorer spaniards worse off and jeopardizing public security .
he pledged to expel any immigrant convicted of a crime .
the parties have also fallen over themselves promising lower taxes , higher pensions , free dental care and cheaper mortgages .
both parties need to win not only the support of swing voters but also motivate their supporters to go to the polls in large numbers in order to win the elections .

he opened the antstore , a shop selling 60 species of the insect and all the accessories needed to set up a successful farm . now business is , if not booming , at least crawling along nicely . watching an ant colony can be a heady , even eerie , experience .
it offers a god 's-eye view ; a rare chance for a person to take in an entire , seething , struggling society at a glance . so it may be the philosophical-existential quality of ant-farming that attracts people to the antstore , which computer programmer martin sebesta opened some five years ago in berlin . or , it could be that people are increasingly looking for low-maintainance pets .
ants are easy to feed , suited to apartment life , and don ’ t shed or run up pricey vet bills . whatever the reason , anyone looking for a particular kind of ant has a good chance of finding it at the antstore .
the shop deals in over 60 types of the insect - mostly exotic breeds , from india , south america , australia and japan , among others . sebesta doesn ’ t only sell ant colonies and farms to walk-in customers .
he has a europe-wide internet mail-order business , and also provides creepy-crawlies for film and tv productions .
he even helped set up a zoo exhibit . for beginners , sebesta recommends weaver ants as being easy to care for .
a colony can live on in an apartment on an island set within a plastic tub of water - although “ you have to be careful that they don ’ t use their larvae to build a bridge over the water and crawl out , ” he warns . some breeds , like south american leaf cutters , may be more dramatic , but sebesta recomments them for experienced ant-farmers , as they need a lot of space .
likewise , bulldog ants – long , thin predatory insects that subsist only on living prey – are best kept by people experienced in the care of exotic animals . “ bulldog ants can see prey up to four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- away , ” sebesta said .

murder reminiscent of madrid bombings the timing of the latest killing has stirred memories of an election-eve massacre by islamic militants who killed 191 people in a string of bombings against commuter trains in madrid in march 2004 .
at the time , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- led by then prime minister jose maria aznar seemed almost certain to win for the third consecutive term during the last national elections in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's last general election was marked by carnage but anger at the conservative government 's attempts to blame those bombings on eta , despite mounting evidence that it was the work of islamists , helped opposition leader zapatero to come from behind to win the elections . many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused aznar of deliberately misleading them .
the latest murder is not expected by many to have a huge impact on the vote both of its small scale and the fact that the two main parties hold relatively similar positions on not negotiating with eta .
eta has killed 820 people in spain during the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero has been under fire for his approach to eta zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta .
in statement read on television friday , mariano rajoy of the conservative pp urged spaniards to " be united against eta , " which should now lose " all hope of achieving its political objectives . "
this time , voters remain more worried about the cooling economy as spaniards struggle with rising unemployment , currently at 2.3 million .
economy remains the key spain 's economy has had among the fastest growth rates in europe during recent years , with 500,000 jobs created annually .
yet indications show that the country 's building boom is coming to an end and growth slowed to 3.8 percent in 2007 .
while the government has a surplus to fall back on , many spaniards , fearing an economic crisis , have put off purchases .
that in turn has caused retail sales and industrial production to taper off .
the job market has shown signs of shrinking , food prices have increased and growth could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
yet many voters find the economic plans of the ruling socialist party , led by jose luis rodrigo zapatero , and his center-right challenger , mariano rajoy of the pp to be nearly indistinguishable .
bitter , populist campaign a bitterly fought campaign marked by nasty personal attacks between the ruling socialist party and the pp has turned off many voters . during their last televised debate , zapatero and rajoy clashed over anti- terrorism policy , immigration and the outlook for the spanish economy , continuously called each other " liars . "
populist rhetoric has dominated the campaign , with the socialists pledging social spending and the pp promising to make immigrants respect spanish customs and to fight juvenile crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy has lashed out at zapatero over his immigration policies rajoy has confronted zapatero 's decision to offer residence permits to more than half a million illegal immigrants who were working in spain when he came to power .
rajoy said the influx of foreigners was leaving many poorer spaniards worse off and jeopardizing public security .
he pledged to expel any immigrant convicted of a crime .
the parties have also fallen over themselves promising lower taxes , higher pensions , free dental care and cheaper mortgages .
both parties need to win not only the support of swing voters but also motivate their supporters to go to the polls in large numbers in order to win the elections .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carrasco was shot dead in front of his family the killing of a former socialist councillor in the basque country has cast a heavy pall on sunday 's voting .
the socialist government and conservative opposition have blamed basque guerrillas of eta for friday 's shooting of isaias carrasco who was assassinated in front of his wife and young daughter outside his house in a small town near the basque coastal city of san sebastian .
zapatero has said the shooting was an attempt by eta to interfere with the elections .
" but spanish democracy has demonstrated that it does not allow challenges from those who oppose its basic principles and its most essential values , " he said .
murder reminiscent of madrid bombings the timing of the latest killing has stirred memories of an election-eve massacre by islamic militants who killed 191 people in a string of bombings against commuter trains in madrid in march 2004 .
at the time , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- led by then prime minister jose maria aznar seemed almost certain to win for the third consecutive term during the last national elections in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's last general election was marked by carnage but anger at the conservative government 's attempts to blame those bombings on eta , despite mounting evidence that it was the work of islamists , helped opposition leader zapatero to come from behind to win the elections . many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused aznar of deliberately misleading them .
the latest murder is not expected by many to have a huge impact on the vote both of its small scale and the fact that the two main parties hold relatively similar positions on not negotiating with eta .
eta has killed 820 people in spain during the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero has been under fire for his approach to eta zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta .
in statement read on television friday , mariano rajoy of the conservative pp urged spaniards to " be united against eta , " which should now lose " all hope of achieving its political objectives . "
this time , voters remain more worried about the cooling economy as spaniards struggle with rising unemployment , currently at 2.3 million .
economy remains the key spain 's economy has had among the fastest growth rates in europe during recent years , with 500,000 jobs created annually .
yet indications show that the country 's building boom is coming to an end and growth slowed to 3.8 percent in 2007 .
while the government has a surplus to fall back on , many spaniards , fearing an economic crisis , have put off purchases .
that in turn has caused retail sales and industrial production to taper off .
the job market has shown signs of shrinking , food prices have increased and growth could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
yet many voters find the economic plans of the ruling socialist party , led by jose luis rodrigo zapatero , and his center-right challenger , mariano rajoy of the pp to be nearly indistinguishable .
bitter , populist campaign a bitterly fought campaign marked by nasty personal attacks between the ruling socialist party and the pp has turned off many voters . during their last televised debate , zapatero and rajoy clashed over anti- terrorism policy , immigration and the outlook for the spanish economy , continuously called each other " liars . "
populist rhetoric has dominated the campaign , with the socialists pledging social spending and the pp promising to make immigrants respect spanish customs and to fight juvenile crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy has lashed out at zapatero over his immigration policies rajoy has confronted zapatero 's decision to offer residence permits to more than half a million illegal immigrants who were working in spain when he came to power .
rajoy said the influx of foreigners was leaving many poorer spaniards worse off and jeopardizing public security .
he pledged to expel any immigrant convicted of a crime .
the parties have also fallen over themselves promising lower taxes , higher pensions , free dental care and cheaper mortgages .
both parties need to win not only the support of swing voters but also motivate their supporters to go to the polls in large numbers in order to win the elections .
with the parties close , the winner could have to rely on the support of smaller parties to form a government .

he opened the antstore , a shop selling 60 species of the insect and all the accessories needed to set up a successful farm . now business is , if not booming , at least crawling along nicely . watching an ant colony can be a heady , even eerie , experience .
it offers a god 's-eye view ; a rare chance for a person to take in an entire , seething , struggling society at a glance . so it may be the philosophical-existential quality of ant-farming that attracts people to the antstore , which computer programmer martin sebesta opened some five years ago in berlin . or , it could be that people are increasingly looking for low-maintainance pets .
ants are easy to feed , suited to apartment life , and don ’ t shed or run up pricey vet bills . whatever the reason , anyone looking for a particular kind of ant has a good chance of finding it at the antstore .
the shop deals in over 60 types of the insect - mostly exotic breeds , from india , south america , australia and japan , among others . sebesta doesn ’ t only sell ant colonies and farms to walk-in customers .
he has a europe-wide internet mail-order business , and also provides creepy-crawlies for film and tv productions .
he even helped set up a zoo exhibit . for beginners , sebesta recommends weaver ants as being easy to care for .
a colony can live on in an apartment on an island set within a plastic tub of water - although “ you have to be careful that they don ’ t use their larvae to build a bridge over the water and crawl out , ” he warns . some breeds , like south american leaf cutters , may be more dramatic , but sebesta recomments them for experienced ant-farmers , as they need a lot of space .
likewise , bulldog ants – long , thin predatory insects that subsist only on living prey – are best kept by people experienced in the care of exotic animals . “ bulldog ants can see prey up to four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- away , ” sebesta said .

globalization and greater flexibility in the labor market are widening the gap between rich and poor . forbes magazine ranked 87-year-old karl albrecht , owner of the aldi discounter chain , as number 10 of the world 's richest people .
his wealth has been estimated at $ 27 billion -lrb- 17.7 billion euros -rrb- . albrecht has built his empire on providing food and clothing at knock-down prices to a chain of stores across europe .
but he might soon be losing most of his middle-income customers in germany as the country counts the cost of income inequality . joachim frick from the diw research institute blamed the hartz iv social benefit cutbacks and other social reforms introduced under former chancellor gerhard schröder as the main culprit . " long-term unemployment and more flexible and temporary working patterns have had an negative effect on the middle classes , " said frick . gap between rich and poor widening the german middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate according to a diw report , presenting a challenge to europe 's largest economy . the berlin-based diw research institute said the sharpest fall has been recorded in the number of " average earners " - that 's the group with an income of between 90 percent and 110 percent of the median income - who saw their income drop five percent .
the median income has been set at 16,200 euros , according to equivalized disposable income , and those under 11,340 euro are considered as living in poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can i afford this ?
in 1992 , more than 49 million belonged to the middle class and this figure , representing 62 percent of germany 's total population , remained constant until the end of the 20th century . by 2006 , the number of people in the middle class , dropped to 54 percent , or 44 million people , according to the study by the diw research institute . diw said the rich have become richer and the poor not only poorer but have also gained in size . " there is a bigger concentration on both ends of the scale , " the research institute said in a statement . " the incomes of those in the upper half of society grew faster than those in the lower half , which means that inequalities on the income scale grew , " it said . traditional families hard hit flexible labor patterns are also taking their toll : temporary jobs , part-time work , those self-employed who are dependent on one employer and so-called " one-euro jobs " for those receiving social security benefits . the study said that more than 11 percent had managed to move up to the upper income bracket .
at the other end of the scale , people on lower incomes - those with 70 percent less than the median - have increased significantly since 2000 to 25 percent of the german population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional families have been hard hit by the reforms one of the main casualties have been traditional families.the decline in the number of middle income families with children under the age of 16 has fallen by three million in 2006 .
but also one million people living in multi-generational households have seen their income fall into lower income bracket . economic upswing faltering germany has emerged from a period of stagnation to experience a mini-economic miracle over the last two years , largely thanks to stronger exports .
but a stronger euro , coupled with rising labor costs and energy prices have dented the economic upswing . the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast for the third time in less than a year to 1.7 percent from 2 percent .
economy minister michael glos said the revision amounted to an appeal to avoid excessive wage accords . corporate profits from 2002-2006 have increased by roughly a third , however , compared to workers ' salaries according to the federal statistics office . the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- said real take-home pay had declined 3.5 per cent for salaried employees since the upswing began in the last quarter of 2004 . the federal statistical office -lrb- destatis -rrb- in a recent study said that just under 13 percent of the population in germany were at risk of poverty .
according to the eu definition , the at-risk-of-poverty rate is the share of persons having to manage on less than 60 percent of their mean income of the entire population . that 's nearly 11 million , including 1.7 million children .
that 's less than most of the eu 's 27 member countries with only scandanavian countries achieving better results .

globalization and greater flexibility in the labor market are widening the gap between rich and poor . forbes magazine ranked 87-year-old karl albrecht , owner of the aldi discounter chain , as number 10 of the world 's richest people .
his wealth has been estimated at $ 27 billion -lrb- 17.7 billion euros -rrb- . albrecht has built his empire on providing food and clothing at knock-down prices to a chain of stores across europe .
but he might soon be losing most of his middle-income customers in germany as the country counts the cost of income inequality . joachim frick from the diw research institute blamed the hartz iv social benefit cutbacks and other social reforms introduced under former chancellor gerhard schröder as the main culprit . " long-term unemployment and more flexible and temporary working patterns have had an negative effect on the middle classes , " said frick . gap between rich and poor widening the german middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate according to a diw report , presenting a challenge to europe 's largest economy . the berlin-based diw research institute said the sharpest fall has been recorded in the number of " average earners " - that 's the group with an income of between 90 percent and 110 percent of the median income - who saw their income drop five percent .
the median income has been set at 16,200 euros , according to equivalized disposable income , and those under 11,340 euro are considered as living in poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can i afford this ?
in 1992 , more than 49 million belonged to the middle class and this figure , representing 62 percent of germany 's total population , remained constant until the end of the 20th century . by 2006 , the number of people in the middle class , dropped to 54 percent , or 44 million people , according to the study by the diw research institute . diw said the rich have become richer and the poor not only poorer but have also gained in size . " there is a bigger concentration on both ends of the scale , " the research institute said in a statement . " the incomes of those in the upper half of society grew faster than those in the lower half , which means that inequalities on the income scale grew , " it said . traditional families hard hit flexible labor patterns are also taking their toll : temporary jobs , part-time work , those self-employed who are dependent on one employer and so-called " one-euro jobs " for those receiving social security benefits . the study said that more than 11 percent had managed to move up to the upper income bracket .
at the other end of the scale , people on lower incomes - those with 70 percent less than the median - have increased significantly since 2000 to 25 percent of the german population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional families have been hard hit by the reforms one of the main casualties have been traditional families.the decline in the number of middle income families with children under the age of 16 has fallen by three million in 2006 .
but also one million people living in multi-generational households have seen their income fall into lower income bracket . economic upswing faltering germany has emerged from a period of stagnation to experience a mini-economic miracle over the last two years , largely thanks to stronger exports .
but a stronger euro , coupled with rising labor costs and energy prices have dented the economic upswing . the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast for the third time in less than a year to 1.7 percent from 2 percent .
economy minister michael glos said the revision amounted to an appeal to avoid excessive wage accords . corporate profits from 2002-2006 have increased by roughly a third , however , compared to workers ' salaries according to the federal statistics office . the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- said real take-home pay had declined 3.5 per cent for salaried employees since the upswing began in the last quarter of 2004 . the federal statistical office -lrb- destatis -rrb- in a recent study said that just under 13 percent of the population in germany were at risk of poverty .
according to the eu definition , the at-risk-of-poverty rate is the share of persons having to manage on less than 60 percent of their mean income of the entire population . that 's nearly 11 million , including 1.7 million children .
that 's less than most of the eu 's 27 member countries with only scandanavian countries achieving better results .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 09.03.2008 socialists celebrate election victory in spain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a high turnout helped zapatero prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has won re-election in spain .
the socialist party -lrb- psoe -rrb- is thought to have benefitted from high voter turnout two days after a basque politician 's murder shocked the country . socialists began celebrating their win soon after polls closed on sunday , march 9 .
" it is a great victory , " the socialist party 's secretary general , jose blanco , annnounced on television .
" it is a victory for all citizens . "
the party won 169 spots in the 350-seat lower house .
with nearly all votes from sunday 's election counted , zapatero 's socialist party had 44 percent , versus 40 percent for the conservative people 's party .
the result give the socialists a plurality , though they 're just shy of the outright 176-seat majority needed to govern alone .
zapatero had been hoping to end his reliance on the support of far-left and regionalist parties , which he has counted on during the past four years .
about 35 million people were eligible to elect the parliament as well as 208 of the 264 members of the senate .
conservatives sidelined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives had hoped for a comeback pio garcia escudero , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- campaign director , conceded defeat sunday night . " i congratulate the socialist party , " garcia escudero has told a press conference in madrid .
" it appears -lsb- their -rsb- victory is clear . "
the loss was a tough blow to the pp , lead by mariano rajoy .
the party seemed unsure during the campaign of how to best stop zapatero 's momentum .
since being elected in 2004 , the socialists have pushed through sweeping social changes , turning spain into one of europe 's most liberal countries on issues such as gay marriage .
zapatero has also sped up divorce , ended compulsory religious education and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants .
the economy was seen as the central theme in the elections , and the pp tried to convince voters it could best handle the economic challenges and keep the country prosperous .
spain 's economy has boomed in the past decade .
yet the annual growth rate could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
and spaniards have worried about unemployment as the country 's construction sector has stagnated .
economy , immigration do n't tip vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero will get four more years the pp had also attacked zapatero for giving 600,000 illegal immigrants the opportunity to have their status “ regularized . ”
rajoy suggested that immigrants should sign an " integration contract " where they promise to respect spain 's laws and customs .
rosa caballero , an insurance worker in madrid , told afp that she was angry after the train bombings in 2004 .
her vote then was “ born of fury and indignation ” over the train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people .
islamist terrorists were responsible , although the pp originally blamed the basque separatist group eta .
caballero told afp she voted for the scialists again on sunday , as did her 19-year-old son , ruben , who said he was n't convinced by the pp arguments on the economy and immigration .
" the slowing of the economy is widespread across europe , " he said .
" immigrants are not a problem here .
they live here happily and more of them should be regularized . ”
socialists get boost from high turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy was unable to convince voters rajoy 's party traditionally enjoys stronger voter turnout among supporters than the socialists , whose voters tend to stay home .
voter turnout was expected to be slightly below the 76 percent in the 2004 elections , when voters turned out en masse to get rid of the ruling conservatives .
the high turnout in 2004 was caused by anger over the pp 's insistence on blaming the basque separatist group eta for deadly train bombings in madrid a few days before the vote .
early indications showed islamist radicals were responsible .
many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused then-pp prime minister jose maria aznar of deliberately misleading them .
basques stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta was blamed for friday 's assassination while voter turnout this time was relatively high , many basques stayed home .
only 53 percent of eligible voters in the basque country cast ballots , according to preliminary election figures .
that was well below the 75 percent turnout that was expected in the rest of spain .
on friday , a former socialist town council member was killed near the coastal city of san sebastian .
all parties immediately blamed the violent separatist group eta , which has been blamed for more than 800 death in spain during the past four decades .
eta has not claimed responsibility for the killing , although police say that it was typical of an eta-style political assassination .
isaias carrasco , who gave up his body guard when he did n't win re-election last fall , was shot outside his home .
eta supporters urged basques to boycott the elections .
" we must vote to teach the terrorists a lesson , " jose angel , a childhood friend of carrasco 's , said as he went to cast his ballot sunday .
" i hope people turn out to vote against everything that has happened .
carrasco 's 19-year-old daughter made an emotional appeal saturday for voters to turn out in large numbers to honor her father and " defeat eta . ”
eta seen as weak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote against eta eta says it wants independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
many spanish commentators felt friday 's assassination showed the group 's weakness and desperation .
zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta , which many felt gave the group legitimacy .
he abandoned them after eta killed two people with a car bomb in december 2006 .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta , which is considered a terrorist group by spain , the european union and the united states .

socialists get boost from high turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy was unable to convince voters rajoy 's party traditionally enjoys stronger voter turnout among supporters than the socialists , whose voters tend to stay home .
voter turnout was expected to be slightly below the 76 percent in the 2004 elections , when voters turned out en masse to get rid of the ruling conservatives .
the high turnout in 2004 was caused by anger over the pp 's insistence on blaming the basque separatist group eta for deadly train bombings in madrid a few days before the vote .
early indications showed islamist radicals were responsible .
many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused then-pp prime minister jose maria aznar of deliberately misleading them .
basques stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta was blamed for friday 's assassination while voter turnout this time was relatively high , many basques stayed home .
only 53 percent of eligible voters in the basque country cast ballots , according to preliminary election figures .
that was well below the 75 percent turnout that was expected in the rest of spain .
on friday , a former socialist town council member was killed near the coastal city of san sebastian .
all parties immediately blamed the violent separatist group eta , which has been blamed for more than 800 death in spain during the past four decades .
eta has not claimed responsibility for the killing , although police say that it was typical of an eta-style political assassination .
isaias carrasco , who gave up his body guard when he did n't win re-election last fall , was shot outside his home .
eta supporters urged basques to boycott the elections .
" we must vote to teach the terrorists a lesson , " jose angel , a childhood friend of carrasco 's , said as he went to cast his ballot sunday .
" i hope people turn out to vote against everything that has happened .
carrasco 's 19-year-old daughter made an emotional appeal saturday for voters to turn out in large numbers to honor her father and " defeat eta . ”
eta seen as weak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote against eta eta says it wants independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
many spanish commentators felt friday 's assassination showed the group 's weakness and desperation .
zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta , which many felt gave the group legitimacy .
he abandoned them after eta killed two people with a car bomb in december 2006 .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta , which is considered a terrorist group by spain , the european union and the united states .

the socialist party -lrb- psoe -rrb- is thought to have benefitted from high voter turnout two days after a basque politician 's murder shocked the country . socialists began celebrating their win soon after polls closed on sunday , march 9 .
" it is a great victory , " the socialist party 's secretary general , jose blanco , annnounced on television .
" it is a victory for all citizens . "
the party won 169 spots in the 350-seat lower house .
with nearly all votes from sunday 's election counted , zapatero 's socialist party had 44 percent , versus 40 percent for the conservative people 's party .
the result give the socialists a plurality , though they 're just shy of the outright 176-seat majority needed to govern alone .
zapatero had been hoping to end his reliance on the support of far-left and regionalist parties , which he has counted on during the past four years .
about 35 million people were eligible to elect the parliament as well as 208 of the 264 members of the senate .
conservatives sidelined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives had hoped for a comeback pio garcia escudero , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- campaign director , conceded defeat sunday night . " i congratulate the socialist party , " garcia escudero has told a press conference in madrid .
" it appears -lsb- their -rsb- victory is clear . "
the loss was a tough blow to the pp , lead by mariano rajoy .
the party seemed unsure during the campaign of how to best stop zapatero 's momentum .
since being elected in 2004 , the socialists have pushed through sweeping social changes , turning spain into one of europe 's most liberal countries on issues such as gay marriage .
zapatero has also sped up divorce , ended compulsory religious education and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants .
the economy was seen as the central theme in the elections , and the pp tried to convince voters it could best handle the economic challenges and keep the country prosperous .
spain 's economy has boomed in the past decade .
yet the annual growth rate could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
and spaniards have worried about unemployment as the country 's construction sector has stagnated .
economy , immigration do n't tip vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero will get four more years the pp had also attacked zapatero for giving 600,000 illegal immigrants the opportunity to have their status “ regularized . ”
rajoy suggested that immigrants should sign an " integration contract " where they promise to respect spain 's laws and customs .
rosa caballero , an insurance worker in madrid , told afp that she was angry after the train bombings in 2004 .
her vote then was “ born of fury and indignation ” over the train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people .
islamist terrorists were responsible , although the pp originally blamed the basque separatist group eta .
caballero told afp she voted for the scialists again on sunday , as did her 19-year-old son , ruben , who said he was n't convinced by the pp arguments on the economy and immigration .
" the slowing of the economy is widespread across europe , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 09.03.2008 socialists celebrate election victory in spain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a high turnout helped zapatero prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has won re-election in spain .
the socialist party -lrb- psoe -rrb- is thought to have benefitted from high voter turnout two days after a basque politician 's murder shocked the country . socialists began celebrating their win soon after polls closed on sunday , march 9 .
" it is a great victory , " the socialist party 's secretary general , jose blanco , annnounced on television .
" it is a victory for all citizens . "
the party won 169 spots in the 350-seat lower house .
with nearly all votes from sunday 's election counted , zapatero 's socialist party had 44 percent , versus 40 percent for the conservative people 's party .
the result give the socialists a plurality , though they 're just shy of the outright 176-seat majority needed to govern alone .
zapatero had been hoping to end his reliance on the support of far-left and regionalist parties , which he has counted on during the past four years .
about 35 million people were eligible to elect the parliament as well as 208 of the 264 members of the senate .
conservatives sidelined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives had hoped for a comeback pio garcia escudero , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- campaign director , conceded defeat sunday night . " i congratulate the socialist party , " garcia escudero has told a press conference in madrid .
" it appears -lsb- their -rsb- victory is clear . "
the loss was a tough blow to the pp , lead by mariano rajoy .
the party seemed unsure during the campaign of how to best stop zapatero 's momentum .
since being elected in 2004 , the socialists have pushed through sweeping social changes , turning spain into one of europe 's most liberal countries on issues such as gay marriage .
zapatero has also sped up divorce , ended compulsory religious education and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants .
the economy was seen as the central theme in the elections , and the pp tried to convince voters it could best handle the economic challenges and keep the country prosperous .
spain 's economy has boomed in the past decade .
yet the annual growth rate could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
and spaniards have worried about unemployment as the country 's construction sector has stagnated .
economy , immigration do n't tip vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero will get four more years the pp had also attacked zapatero for giving 600,000 illegal immigrants the opportunity to have their status “ regularized . ”
rajoy suggested that immigrants should sign an " integration contract " where they promise to respect spain 's laws and customs .
rosa caballero , an insurance worker in madrid , told afp that she was angry after the train bombings in 2004 .
her vote then was “ born of fury and indignation ” over the train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people .
islamist terrorists were responsible , although the pp originally blamed the basque separatist group eta .
caballero told afp she voted for the scialists again on sunday , as did her 19-year-old son , ruben , who said he was n't convinced by the pp arguments on the economy and immigration .
" the slowing of the economy is widespread across europe , " he said .
" immigrants are not a problem here .
they live here happily and more of them should be regularized . ”
socialists get boost from high turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy was unable to convince voters rajoy 's party traditionally enjoys stronger voter turnout among supporters than the socialists , whose voters tend to stay home .
voter turnout was expected to be slightly below the 76 percent in the 2004 elections , when voters turned out en masse to get rid of the ruling conservatives .
the high turnout in 2004 was caused by anger over the pp 's insistence on blaming the basque separatist group eta for deadly train bombings in madrid a few days before the vote .
early indications showed islamist radicals were responsible .
many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused then-pp prime minister jose maria aznar of deliberately misleading them .
basques stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta was blamed for friday 's assassination while voter turnout this time was relatively high , many basques stayed home .
only 53 percent of eligible voters in the basque country cast ballots , according to preliminary election figures .
that was well below the 75 percent turnout that was expected in the rest of spain .
on friday , a former socialist town council member was killed near the coastal city of san sebastian .
all parties immediately blamed the violent separatist group eta , which has been blamed for more than 800 death in spain during the past four decades .
eta has not claimed responsibility for the killing , although police say that it was typical of an eta-style political assassination .
isaias carrasco , who gave up his body guard when he did n't win re-election last fall , was shot outside his home .
eta supporters urged basques to boycott the elections .
" we must vote to teach the terrorists a lesson , " jose angel , a childhood friend of carrasco 's , said as he went to cast his ballot sunday .
" i hope people turn out to vote against everything that has happened .
carrasco 's 19-year-old daughter made an emotional appeal saturday for voters to turn out in large numbers to honor her father and " defeat eta . ”
eta seen as weak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote against eta eta says it wants independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
many spanish commentators felt friday 's assassination showed the group 's weakness and desperation .
zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta , which many felt gave the group legitimacy .
he abandoned them after eta killed two people with a car bomb in december 2006 .

globalization and greater flexibility in the labor market are widening the gap between rich and poor . forbes magazine ranked 87-year-old karl albrecht , owner of the aldi discounter chain , as number 10 of the world 's richest people .
his wealth has been estimated at $ 27 billion -lrb- 17.7 billion euros -rrb- . albrecht has built his empire on providing food and clothing at knock-down prices to a chain of stores across europe .
but he might soon be losing most of his middle-income customers in germany as the country counts the cost of income inequality . joachim frick from the diw research institute blamed the hartz iv social benefit cutbacks and other social reforms introduced under former chancellor gerhard schröder as the main culprit . " long-term unemployment and more flexible and temporary working patterns have had an negative effect on the middle classes , " said frick . gap between rich and poor widening the german middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate according to a diw report , presenting a challenge to europe 's largest economy . the berlin-based diw research institute said the sharpest fall has been recorded in the number of " average earners " - that 's the group with an income of between 90 percent and 110 percent of the median income - who saw their income drop five percent .
the median income has been set at 16,200 euros , according to equivalized disposable income , and those under 11,340 euro are considered as living in poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can i afford this ?
in 1992 , more than 49 million belonged to the middle class and this figure , representing 62 percent of germany 's total population , remained constant until the end of the 20th century . by 2006 , the number of people in the middle class , dropped to 54 percent , or 44 million people , according to the study by the diw research institute . diw said the rich have become richer and the poor not only poorer but have also gained in size . " there is a bigger concentration on both ends of the scale , " the research institute said in a statement . " the incomes of those in the upper half of society grew faster than those in the lower half , which means that inequalities on the income scale grew , " it said . traditional families hard hit flexible labor patterns are also taking their toll : temporary jobs , part-time work , those self-employed who are dependent on one employer and so-called " one-euro jobs " for those receiving social security benefits . the study said that more than 11 percent had managed to move up to the upper income bracket .
at the other end of the scale , people on lower incomes - those with 70 percent less than the median - have increased significantly since 2000 to 25 percent of the german population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional families have been hard hit by the reforms one of the main casualties have been traditional families.the decline in the number of middle income families with children under the age of 16 has fallen by three million in 2006 .
but also one million people living in multi-generational households have seen their income fall into lower income bracket . economic upswing faltering germany has emerged from a period of stagnation to experience a mini-economic miracle over the last two years , largely thanks to stronger exports .
but a stronger euro , coupled with rising labor costs and energy prices have dented the economic upswing . the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast for the third time in less than a year to 1.7 percent from 2 percent .
economy minister michael glos said the revision amounted to an appeal to avoid excessive wage accords . corporate profits from 2002-2006 have increased by roughly a third , however , compared to workers ' salaries according to the federal statistics office . the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- said real take-home pay had declined 3.5 per cent for salaried employees since the upswing began in the last quarter of 2004 . the federal statistical office -lrb- destatis -rrb- in a recent study said that just under 13 percent of the population in germany were at risk of poverty .

globalization and greater flexibility in the labor market are widening the gap between rich and poor . forbes magazine ranked 87-year-old karl albrecht , owner of the aldi discounter chain , as number 10 of the world 's richest people .
his wealth has been estimated at $ 27 billion -lrb- 17.7 billion euros -rrb- . albrecht has built his empire on providing food and clothing at knock-down prices to a chain of stores across europe .
but he might soon be losing most of his middle-income customers in germany as the country counts the cost of income inequality . joachim frick from the diw research institute blamed the hartz iv social benefit cutbacks and other social reforms introduced under former chancellor gerhard schröder as the main culprit . " long-term unemployment and more flexible and temporary working patterns have had an negative effect on the middle classes , " said frick . gap between rich and poor widening the german middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate according to a diw report , presenting a challenge to europe 's largest economy . the berlin-based diw research institute said the sharpest fall has been recorded in the number of " average earners " - that 's the group with an income of between 90 percent and 110 percent of the median income - who saw their income drop five percent .
the median income has been set at 16,200 euros , according to equivalized disposable income , and those under 11,340 euro are considered as living in poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can i afford this ?
in 1992 , more than 49 million belonged to the middle class and this figure , representing 62 percent of germany 's total population , remained constant until the end of the 20th century . by 2006 , the number of people in the middle class , dropped to 54 percent , or 44 million people , according to the study by the diw research institute . diw said the rich have become richer and the poor not only poorer but have also gained in size . " there is a bigger concentration on both ends of the scale , " the research institute said in a statement . " the incomes of those in the upper half of society grew faster than those in the lower half , which means that inequalities on the income scale grew , " it said . traditional families hard hit flexible labor patterns are also taking their toll : temporary jobs , part-time work , those self-employed who are dependent on one employer and so-called " one-euro jobs " for those receiving social security benefits . the study said that more than 11 percent had managed to move up to the upper income bracket .
at the other end of the scale , people on lower incomes - those with 70 percent less than the median - have increased significantly since 2000 to 25 percent of the german population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional families have been hard hit by the reforms one of the main casualties have been traditional families.the decline in the number of middle income families with children under the age of 16 has fallen by three million in 2006 .

he has a europe-wide internet mail-order business , and also provides creepy-crawlies for film and tv productions .
he even helped set up a zoo exhibit . for beginners , sebesta recommends weaver ants as being easy to care for .
a colony can live on in an apartment on an island set within a plastic tub of water - although “ you have to be careful that they don ’ t use their larvae to build a bridge over the water and crawl out , ” he warns . some breeds , like south american leaf cutters , may be more dramatic , but sebesta recomments them for experienced ant-farmers , as they need a lot of space .
likewise , bulldog ants – long , thin predatory insects that subsist only on living prey – are best kept by people experienced in the care of exotic animals . “ bulldog ants can see prey up to four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- away , ” sebesta said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carrasco was shot dead in front of his family the killing of a former socialist councillor in the basque country has cast a heavy pall on sunday 's voting .
the socialist government and conservative opposition have blamed basque guerrillas of eta for friday 's shooting of isaias carrasco who was assassinated in front of his wife and young daughter outside his house in a small town near the basque coastal city of san sebastian .
zapatero has said the shooting was an attempt by eta to interfere with the elections .
" but spanish democracy has demonstrated that it does not allow challenges from those who oppose its basic principles and its most essential values , " he said .
murder reminiscent of madrid bombings the timing of the latest killing has stirred memories of an election-eve massacre by islamic militants who killed 191 people in a string of bombings against commuter trains in madrid in march 2004 .
at the time , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- led by then prime minister jose maria aznar seemed almost certain to win for the third consecutive term during the last national elections in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's last general election was marked by carnage but anger at the conservative government 's attempts to blame those bombings on eta , despite mounting evidence that it was the work of islamists , helped opposition leader zapatero to come from behind to win the elections . many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused aznar of deliberately misleading them .
the latest murder is not expected by many to have a huge impact on the vote both of its small scale and the fact that the two main parties hold relatively similar positions on not negotiating with eta .
eta has killed 820 people in spain during the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero has been under fire for his approach to eta zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta .
in statement read on television friday , mariano rajoy of the conservative pp urged spaniards to " be united against eta , " which should now lose " all hope of achieving its political objectives . "
this time , voters remain more worried about the cooling economy as spaniards struggle with rising unemployment , currently at 2.3 million .
economy remains the key spain 's economy has had among the fastest growth rates in europe during recent years , with 500,000 jobs created annually .
yet indications show that the country 's building boom is coming to an end and growth slowed to 3.8 percent in 2007 .
while the government has a surplus to fall back on , many spaniards , fearing an economic crisis , have put off purchases .
that in turn has caused retail sales and industrial production to taper off .
the job market has shown signs of shrinking , food prices have increased and growth could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
yet many voters find the economic plans of the ruling socialist party , led by jose luis rodrigo zapatero , and his center-right challenger , mariano rajoy of the pp to be nearly indistinguishable .
bitter , populist campaign a bitterly fought campaign marked by nasty personal attacks between the ruling socialist party and the pp has turned off many voters . during their last televised debate , zapatero and rajoy clashed over anti- terrorism policy , immigration and the outlook for the spanish economy , continuously called each other " liars . "
populist rhetoric has dominated the campaign , with the socialists pledging social spending and the pp promising to make immigrants respect spanish customs and to fight juvenile crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy has lashed out at zapatero over his immigration policies rajoy has confronted zapatero 's decision to offer residence permits to more than half a million illegal immigrants who were working in spain when he came to power .
rajoy said the influx of foreigners was leaving many poorer spaniards worse off and jeopardizing public security .
he pledged to expel any immigrant convicted of a crime .
the parties have also fallen over themselves promising lower taxes , higher pensions , free dental care and cheaper mortgages .
both parties need to win not only the support of swing voters but also motivate their supporters to go to the polls in large numbers in order to win the elections .
with the parties close , the winner could have to rely on the support of smaller parties to form a government .
zapatero has been in a thorny alliance with the separatist republican left of catalonia -lrb- erc -rrb- and the united left , a coalition of greens and communists .

" but spanish democracy has demonstrated that it does not allow challenges from those who oppose its basic principles and its most essential values , " he said .
murder reminiscent of madrid bombings the timing of the latest killing has stirred memories of an election-eve massacre by islamic militants who killed 191 people in a string of bombings against commuter trains in madrid in march 2004 .
at the time , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- led by then prime minister jose maria aznar seemed almost certain to win for the third consecutive term during the last national elections in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's last general election was marked by carnage but anger at the conservative government 's attempts to blame those bombings on eta , despite mounting evidence that it was the work of islamists , helped opposition leader zapatero to come from behind to win the elections . many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused aznar of deliberately misleading them .
the latest murder is not expected by many to have a huge impact on the vote both of its small scale and the fact that the two main parties hold relatively similar positions on not negotiating with eta .
eta has killed 820 people in spain during the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero has been under fire for his approach to eta zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta .
in statement read on television friday , mariano rajoy of the conservative pp urged spaniards to " be united against eta , " which should now lose " all hope of achieving its political objectives . "
this time , voters remain more worried about the cooling economy as spaniards struggle with rising unemployment , currently at 2.3 million .
economy remains the key spain 's economy has had among the fastest growth rates in europe during recent years , with 500,000 jobs created annually .
yet indications show that the country 's building boom is coming to an end and growth slowed to 3.8 percent in 2007 .
while the government has a surplus to fall back on , many spaniards , fearing an economic crisis , have put off purchases .
that in turn has caused retail sales and industrial production to taper off .
the job market has shown signs of shrinking , food prices have increased and growth could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
yet many voters find the economic plans of the ruling socialist party , led by jose luis rodrigo zapatero , and his center-right challenger , mariano rajoy of the pp to be nearly indistinguishable .
bitter , populist campaign a bitterly fought campaign marked by nasty personal attacks between the ruling socialist party and the pp has turned off many voters . during their last televised debate , zapatero and rajoy clashed over anti- terrorism policy , immigration and the outlook for the spanish economy , continuously called each other " liars . "
populist rhetoric has dominated the campaign , with the socialists pledging social spending and the pp promising to make immigrants respect spanish customs and to fight juvenile crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy has lashed out at zapatero over his immigration policies rajoy has confronted zapatero 's decision to offer residence permits to more than half a million illegal immigrants who were working in spain when he came to power .
rajoy said the influx of foreigners was leaving many poorer spaniards worse off and jeopardizing public security .
he pledged to expel any immigrant convicted of a crime .
the parties have also fallen over themselves promising lower taxes , higher pensions , free dental care and cheaper mortgages .
both parties need to win not only the support of swing voters but also motivate their supporters to go to the polls in large numbers in order to win the elections .
with the parties close , the winner could have to rely on the support of smaller parties to form a government .
zapatero has been in a thorny alliance with the separatist republican left of catalonia -lrb- erc -rrb- and the united left , a coalition of greens and communists .
parties far apart on social issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a close race , differences on social issues may matter in a very close race , voters will likely take a look at the differences between social issues , experts say .
zapatero 's government pushed through fast-track divorces , legalized gay marriage and adoption , granted amnesty to many illegal immigrants and ended compulsory religious education in schools .
the people 's party fiercely opposed these initiatives , although it has been reluctant to make a big deal about them in the campaign , worried that doing so could backfire with swing voters . dw staff -lrb- th / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the socialist party -lrb- psoe -rrb- is thought to have benefitted from high voter turnout two days after a basque politician 's murder shocked the country . socialists began celebrating their win soon after polls closed on sunday , march 9 .
" it is a great victory , " the socialist party 's secretary general , jose blanco , annnounced on television .
" it is a victory for all citizens . "
the party won 169 spots in the 350-seat lower house .
with nearly all votes from sunday 's election counted , zapatero 's socialist party had 44 percent , versus 40 percent for the conservative people 's party .
the result give the socialists a plurality , though they 're just shy of the outright 176-seat majority needed to govern alone .
zapatero had been hoping to end his reliance on the support of far-left and regionalist parties , which he has counted on during the past four years .
about 35 million people were eligible to elect the parliament as well as 208 of the 264 members of the senate .
conservatives sidelined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives had hoped for a comeback pio garcia escudero , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- campaign director , conceded defeat sunday night . " i congratulate the socialist party , " garcia escudero has told a press conference in madrid .
" it appears -lsb- their -rsb- victory is clear . "
the loss was a tough blow to the pp , lead by mariano rajoy .
the party seemed unsure during the campaign of how to best stop zapatero 's momentum .
since being elected in 2004 , the socialists have pushed through sweeping social changes , turning spain into one of europe 's most liberal countries on issues such as gay marriage .
zapatero has also sped up divorce , ended compulsory religious education and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants .
the economy was seen as the central theme in the elections , and the pp tried to convince voters it could best handle the economic challenges and keep the country prosperous .
spain 's economy has boomed in the past decade .
yet the annual growth rate could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
and spaniards have worried about unemployment as the country 's construction sector has stagnated .
economy , immigration do n't tip vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero will get four more years the pp had also attacked zapatero for giving 600,000 illegal immigrants the opportunity to have their status “ regularized . ”
rajoy suggested that immigrants should sign an " integration contract " where they promise to respect spain 's laws and customs .
rosa caballero , an insurance worker in madrid , told afp that she was angry after the train bombings in 2004 .
her vote then was “ born of fury and indignation ” over the train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people .
islamist terrorists were responsible , although the pp originally blamed the basque separatist group eta .
caballero told afp she voted for the scialists again on sunday , as did her 19-year-old son , ruben , who said he was n't convinced by the pp arguments on the economy and immigration .
" the slowing of the economy is widespread across europe , " he said .
" immigrants are not a problem here .
they live here happily and more of them should be regularized . ”
socialists get boost from high turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy was unable to convince voters rajoy 's party traditionally enjoys stronger voter turnout among supporters than the socialists , whose voters tend to stay home .
voter turnout was expected to be slightly below the 76 percent in the 2004 elections , when voters turned out en masse to get rid of the ruling conservatives .
the high turnout in 2004 was caused by anger over the pp 's insistence on blaming the basque separatist group eta for deadly train bombings in madrid a few days before the vote .
early indications showed islamist radicals were responsible .
many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused then-pp prime minister jose maria aznar of deliberately misleading them .
basques stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta was blamed for friday 's assassination while voter turnout this time was relatively high , many basques stayed home .
only 53 percent of eligible voters in the basque country cast ballots , according to preliminary election figures .
that was well below the 75 percent turnout that was expected in the rest of spain .
on friday , a former socialist town council member was killed near the coastal city of san sebastian .
all parties immediately blamed the violent separatist group eta , which has been blamed for more than 800 death in spain during the past four decades .
eta has not claimed responsibility for the killing , although police say that it was typical of an eta-style political assassination .
isaias carrasco , who gave up his body guard when he did n't win re-election last fall , was shot outside his home .
eta supporters urged basques to boycott the elections .
" we must vote to teach the terrorists a lesson , " jose angel , a childhood friend of carrasco 's , said as he went to cast his ballot sunday .
" i hope people turn out to vote against everything that has happened .
carrasco 's 19-year-old daughter made an emotional appeal saturday for voters to turn out in large numbers to honor her father and " defeat eta . ”
eta seen as weak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote against eta eta says it wants independence for the basque region in northern spain .

the socialist party -lrb- psoe -rrb- is thought to have benefitted from high voter turnout two days after a basque politician 's murder shocked the country . socialists began celebrating their win soon after polls closed on sunday , march 9 .
" it is a great victory , " the socialist party 's secretary general , jose blanco , annnounced on television .
" it is a victory for all citizens . "
the party won 169 spots in the 350-seat lower house .
with nearly all votes from sunday 's election counted , zapatero 's socialist party had 44 percent , versus 40 percent for the conservative people 's party .
the result give the socialists a plurality , though they 're just shy of the outright 176-seat majority needed to govern alone .
zapatero had been hoping to end his reliance on the support of far-left and regionalist parties , which he has counted on during the past four years .
about 35 million people were eligible to elect the parliament as well as 208 of the 264 members of the senate .
conservatives sidelined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives had hoped for a comeback pio garcia escudero , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- campaign director , conceded defeat sunday night . " i congratulate the socialist party , " garcia escudero has told a press conference in madrid .
" it appears -lsb- their -rsb- victory is clear . "
the loss was a tough blow to the pp , lead by mariano rajoy .
the party seemed unsure during the campaign of how to best stop zapatero 's momentum .
since being elected in 2004 , the socialists have pushed through sweeping social changes , turning spain into one of europe 's most liberal countries on issues such as gay marriage .
zapatero has also sped up divorce , ended compulsory religious education and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants .
the economy was seen as the central theme in the elections , and the pp tried to convince voters it could best handle the economic challenges and keep the country prosperous .
spain 's economy has boomed in the past decade .
yet the annual growth rate could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
and spaniards have worried about unemployment as the country 's construction sector has stagnated .
economy , immigration do n't tip vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero will get four more years the pp had also attacked zapatero for giving 600,000 illegal immigrants the opportunity to have their status “ regularized . ”
rajoy suggested that immigrants should sign an " integration contract " where they promise to respect spain 's laws and customs .
rosa caballero , an insurance worker in madrid , told afp that she was angry after the train bombings in 2004 .
her vote then was “ born of fury and indignation ” over the train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people .
islamist terrorists were responsible , although the pp originally blamed the basque separatist group eta .
caballero told afp she voted for the scialists again on sunday , as did her 19-year-old son , ruben , who said he was n't convinced by the pp arguments on the economy and immigration .
" the slowing of the economy is widespread across europe , " he said .
" immigrants are not a problem here .
they live here happily and more of them should be regularized . ”
socialists get boost from high turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy was unable to convince voters rajoy 's party traditionally enjoys stronger voter turnout among supporters than the socialists , whose voters tend to stay home .
voter turnout was expected to be slightly below the 76 percent in the 2004 elections , when voters turned out en masse to get rid of the ruling conservatives .
the high turnout in 2004 was caused by anger over the pp 's insistence on blaming the basque separatist group eta for deadly train bombings in madrid a few days before the vote .
early indications showed islamist radicals were responsible .
many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused then-pp prime minister jose maria aznar of deliberately misleading them .
basques stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta was blamed for friday 's assassination while voter turnout this time was relatively high , many basques stayed home .
only 53 percent of eligible voters in the basque country cast ballots , according to preliminary election figures .
that was well below the 75 percent turnout that was expected in the rest of spain .
on friday , a former socialist town council member was killed near the coastal city of san sebastian .
all parties immediately blamed the violent separatist group eta , which has been blamed for more than 800 death in spain during the past four decades .
eta has not claimed responsibility for the killing , although police say that it was typical of an eta-style political assassination .
isaias carrasco , who gave up his body guard when he did n't win re-election last fall , was shot outside his home .
eta supporters urged basques to boycott the elections .
" we must vote to teach the terrorists a lesson , " jose angel , a childhood friend of carrasco 's , said as he went to cast his ballot sunday .
" i hope people turn out to vote against everything that has happened .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 09.03.2008 socialists celebrate election victory in spain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a high turnout helped zapatero prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has won re-election in spain .
the socialist party -lrb- psoe -rrb- is thought to have benefitted from high voter turnout two days after a basque politician 's murder shocked the country . socialists began celebrating their win soon after polls closed on sunday , march 9 .
" it is a great victory , " the socialist party 's secretary general , jose blanco , annnounced on television .
" it is a victory for all citizens . "
the party won 169 spots in the 350-seat lower house .
with nearly all votes from sunday 's election counted , zapatero 's socialist party had 44 percent , versus 40 percent for the conservative people 's party .
the result give the socialists a plurality , though they 're just shy of the outright 176-seat majority needed to govern alone .
zapatero had been hoping to end his reliance on the support of far-left and regionalist parties , which he has counted on during the past four years .
about 35 million people were eligible to elect the parliament as well as 208 of the 264 members of the senate .
conservatives sidelined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives had hoped for a comeback pio garcia escudero , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- campaign director , conceded defeat sunday night . " i congratulate the socialist party , " garcia escudero has told a press conference in madrid .
" it appears -lsb- their -rsb- victory is clear . "
the loss was a tough blow to the pp , lead by mariano rajoy .
the party seemed unsure during the campaign of how to best stop zapatero 's momentum .
since being elected in 2004 , the socialists have pushed through sweeping social changes , turning spain into one of europe 's most liberal countries on issues such as gay marriage .
zapatero has also sped up divorce , ended compulsory religious education and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants .
the economy was seen as the central theme in the elections , and the pp tried to convince voters it could best handle the economic challenges and keep the country prosperous .
spain 's economy has boomed in the past decade .
yet the annual growth rate could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
and spaniards have worried about unemployment as the country 's construction sector has stagnated .
economy , immigration do n't tip vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero will get four more years the pp had also attacked zapatero for giving 600,000 illegal immigrants the opportunity to have their status “ regularized . ”
rajoy suggested that immigrants should sign an " integration contract " where they promise to respect spain 's laws and customs .
rosa caballero , an insurance worker in madrid , told afp that she was angry after the train bombings in 2004 .
her vote then was “ born of fury and indignation ” over the train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people .
islamist terrorists were responsible , although the pp originally blamed the basque separatist group eta .
caballero told afp she voted for the scialists again on sunday , as did her 19-year-old son , ruben , who said he was n't convinced by the pp arguments on the economy and immigration .
" the slowing of the economy is widespread across europe , " he said .
" immigrants are not a problem here .
they live here happily and more of them should be regularized . ”
socialists get boost from high turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy was unable to convince voters rajoy 's party traditionally enjoys stronger voter turnout among supporters than the socialists , whose voters tend to stay home .
voter turnout was expected to be slightly below the 76 percent in the 2004 elections , when voters turned out en masse to get rid of the ruling conservatives .
the high turnout in 2004 was caused by anger over the pp 's insistence on blaming the basque separatist group eta for deadly train bombings in madrid a few days before the vote .
early indications showed islamist radicals were responsible .
many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused then-pp prime minister jose maria aznar of deliberately misleading them .
basques stay home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta was blamed for friday 's assassination while voter turnout this time was relatively high , many basques stayed home .
only 53 percent of eligible voters in the basque country cast ballots , according to preliminary election figures .
that was well below the 75 percent turnout that was expected in the rest of spain .
on friday , a former socialist town council member was killed near the coastal city of san sebastian .
all parties immediately blamed the violent separatist group eta , which has been blamed for more than 800 death in spain during the past four decades .
eta has not claimed responsibility for the killing , although police say that it was typical of an eta-style political assassination .
isaias carrasco , who gave up his body guard when he did n't win re-election last fall , was shot outside his home .
eta supporters urged basques to boycott the elections .
" we must vote to teach the terrorists a lesson , " jose angel , a childhood friend of carrasco 's , said as he went to cast his ballot sunday .
" i hope people turn out to vote against everything that has happened .
carrasco 's 19-year-old daughter made an emotional appeal saturday for voters to turn out in large numbers to honor her father and " defeat eta . ”
eta seen as weak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote against eta eta says it wants independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
many spanish commentators felt friday 's assassination showed the group 's weakness and desperation .
zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta , which many felt gave the group legitimacy .
he abandoned them after eta killed two people with a car bomb in december 2006 .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta , which is considered a terrorist group by spain , the european union and the united states .
both parties have promised not to negotiate with eta . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 09.03.2008 germany 's middle classes shrinking , study warns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's poor are n't just getting poorer , their numbers are rising too germany 's recent economic upswing is bypassing the middle classes , according to an economic research institute .
globalization and greater flexibility in the labor market are widening the gap between rich and poor . forbes magazine ranked 87-year-old karl albrecht , owner of the aldi discounter chain , as number 10 of the world 's richest people .
his wealth has been estimated at $ 27 billion -lrb- 17.7 billion euros -rrb- . albrecht has built his empire on providing food and clothing at knock-down prices to a chain of stores across europe .
but he might soon be losing most of his middle-income customers in germany as the country counts the cost of income inequality . joachim frick from the diw research institute blamed the hartz iv social benefit cutbacks and other social reforms introduced under former chancellor gerhard schröder as the main culprit . " long-term unemployment and more flexible and temporary working patterns have had an negative effect on the middle classes , " said frick . gap between rich and poor widening the german middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate according to a diw report , presenting a challenge to europe 's largest economy . the berlin-based diw research institute said the sharpest fall has been recorded in the number of " average earners " - that 's the group with an income of between 90 percent and 110 percent of the median income - who saw their income drop five percent .
the median income has been set at 16,200 euros , according to equivalized disposable income , and those under 11,340 euro are considered as living in poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can i afford this ?
in 1992 , more than 49 million belonged to the middle class and this figure , representing 62 percent of germany 's total population , remained constant until the end of the 20th century . by 2006 , the number of people in the middle class , dropped to 54 percent , or 44 million people , according to the study by the diw research institute . diw said the rich have become richer and the poor not only poorer but have also gained in size . " there is a bigger concentration on both ends of the scale , " the research institute said in a statement . " the incomes of those in the upper half of society grew faster than those in the lower half , which means that inequalities on the income scale grew , " it said . traditional families hard hit flexible labor patterns are also taking their toll : temporary jobs , part-time work , those self-employed who are dependent on one employer and so-called " one-euro jobs " for those receiving social security benefits . the study said that more than 11 percent had managed to move up to the upper income bracket .
at the other end of the scale , people on lower incomes - those with 70 percent less than the median - have increased significantly since 2000 to 25 percent of the german population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional families have been hard hit by the reforms one of the main casualties have been traditional families.the decline in the number of middle income families with children under the age of 16 has fallen by three million in 2006 .
but also one million people living in multi-generational households have seen their income fall into lower income bracket . economic upswing faltering germany has emerged from a period of stagnation to experience a mini-economic miracle over the last two years , largely thanks to stronger exports .
but a stronger euro , coupled with rising labor costs and energy prices have dented the economic upswing . the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast for the third time in less than a year to 1.7 percent from 2 percent .
economy minister michael glos said the revision amounted to an appeal to avoid excessive wage accords . corporate profits from 2002-2006 have increased by roughly a third , however , compared to workers ' salaries according to the federal statistics office . the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- said real take-home pay had declined 3.5 per cent for salaried employees since the upswing began in the last quarter of 2004 . the federal statistical office -lrb- destatis -rrb- in a recent study said that just under 13 percent of the population in germany were at risk of poverty .
according to the eu definition , the at-risk-of-poverty rate is the share of persons having to manage on less than 60 percent of their mean income of the entire population . that 's nearly 11 million , including 1.7 million children .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carrasco was shot dead in front of his family the killing of a former socialist councillor in the basque country has cast a heavy pall on sunday 's voting .
the socialist government and conservative opposition have blamed basque guerrillas of eta for friday 's shooting of isaias carrasco who was assassinated in front of his wife and young daughter outside his house in a small town near the basque coastal city of san sebastian .
zapatero has said the shooting was an attempt by eta to interfere with the elections .
" but spanish democracy has demonstrated that it does not allow challenges from those who oppose its basic principles and its most essential values , " he said .
murder reminiscent of madrid bombings the timing of the latest killing has stirred memories of an election-eve massacre by islamic militants who killed 191 people in a string of bombings against commuter trains in madrid in march 2004 .
at the time , the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- led by then prime minister jose maria aznar seemed almost certain to win for the third consecutive term during the last national elections in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's last general election was marked by carnage but anger at the conservative government 's attempts to blame those bombings on eta , despite mounting evidence that it was the work of islamists , helped opposition leader zapatero to come from behind to win the elections . many voters felt spain was attacked because of the conservative government 's alliance with the united states in fighting in iraq and accused aznar of deliberately misleading them .
the latest murder is not expected by many to have a huge impact on the vote both of its small scale and the fact that the two main parties hold relatively similar positions on not negotiating with eta .
eta has killed 820 people in spain during the past four decades in an attempt to gain independence for the basque region in northern spain .
opinion polls show that while many basques are unhappy with their current status as an autonomous region , most do n't want complete independence from spain .
and only a small fraction support eta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero has been under fire for his approach to eta zapatero had made the controversial move of launching peace talks with eta before abandoning them in december 2006 after eta killed two people with a car bomb .
he has been repeatedly slammed by the pp for negotiating with eta .
in statement read on television friday , mariano rajoy of the conservative pp urged spaniards to " be united against eta , " which should now lose " all hope of achieving its political objectives . "
this time , voters remain more worried about the cooling economy as spaniards struggle with rising unemployment , currently at 2.3 million .
economy remains the key spain 's economy has had among the fastest growth rates in europe during recent years , with 500,000 jobs created annually .
yet indications show that the country 's building boom is coming to an end and growth slowed to 3.8 percent in 2007 .
while the government has a surplus to fall back on , many spaniards , fearing an economic crisis , have put off purchases .
that in turn has caused retail sales and industrial production to taper off .
the job market has shown signs of shrinking , food prices have increased and growth could sink as low as 2 percent in 2008 .
yet many voters find the economic plans of the ruling socialist party , led by jose luis rodrigo zapatero , and his center-right challenger , mariano rajoy of the pp to be nearly indistinguishable .
bitter , populist campaign a bitterly fought campaign marked by nasty personal attacks between the ruling socialist party and the pp has turned off many voters . during their last televised debate , zapatero and rajoy clashed over anti- terrorism policy , immigration and the outlook for the spanish economy , continuously called each other " liars . "
populist rhetoric has dominated the campaign , with the socialists pledging social spending and the pp promising to make immigrants respect spanish customs and to fight juvenile crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rajoy has lashed out at zapatero over his immigration policies rajoy has confronted zapatero 's decision to offer residence permits to more than half a million illegal immigrants who were working in spain when he came to power .
rajoy said the influx of foreigners was leaving many poorer spaniards worse off and jeopardizing public security .
he pledged to expel any immigrant convicted of a crime .
the parties have also fallen over themselves promising lower taxes , higher pensions , free dental care and cheaper mortgages .
both parties need to win not only the support of swing voters but also motivate their supporters to go to the polls in large numbers in order to win the elections .
with the parties close , the winner could have to rely on the support of smaller parties to form a government .
zapatero has been in a thorny alliance with the separatist republican left of catalonia -lrb- erc -rrb- and the united left , a coalition of greens and communists .
parties far apart on social issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a close race , differences on social issues may matter in a very close race , voters will likely take a look at the differences between social issues , experts say .
zapatero 's government pushed through fast-track divorces , legalized gay marriage and adoption , granted amnesty to many illegal immigrants and ended compulsory religious education in schools .
the people 's party fiercely opposed these initiatives , although it has been reluctant to make a big deal about them in the campaign , worried that doing so could backfire with swing voters . dw staff -lrb- th / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

globalization and greater flexibility in the labor market are widening the gap between rich and poor . forbes magazine ranked 87-year-old karl albrecht , owner of the aldi discounter chain , as number 10 of the world 's richest people .
his wealth has been estimated at $ 27 billion -lrb- 17.7 billion euros -rrb- . albrecht has built his empire on providing food and clothing at knock-down prices to a chain of stores across europe .
but he might soon be losing most of his middle-income customers in germany as the country counts the cost of income inequality . joachim frick from the diw research institute blamed the hartz iv social benefit cutbacks and other social reforms introduced under former chancellor gerhard schröder as the main culprit . " long-term unemployment and more flexible and temporary working patterns have had an negative effect on the middle classes , " said frick . gap between rich and poor widening the german middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate according to a diw report , presenting a challenge to europe 's largest economy . the berlin-based diw research institute said the sharpest fall has been recorded in the number of " average earners " - that 's the group with an income of between 90 percent and 110 percent of the median income - who saw their income drop five percent .
the median income has been set at 16,200 euros , according to equivalized disposable income , and those under 11,340 euro are considered as living in poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can i afford this ?
in 1992 , more than 49 million belonged to the middle class and this figure , representing 62 percent of germany 's total population , remained constant until the end of the 20th century . by 2006 , the number of people in the middle class , dropped to 54 percent , or 44 million people , according to the study by the diw research institute . diw said the rich have become richer and the poor not only poorer but have also gained in size . " there is a bigger concentration on both ends of the scale , " the research institute said in a statement . " the incomes of those in the upper half of society grew faster than those in the lower half , which means that inequalities on the income scale grew , " it said . traditional families hard hit flexible labor patterns are also taking their toll : temporary jobs , part-time work , those self-employed who are dependent on one employer and so-called " one-euro jobs " for those receiving social security benefits . the study said that more than 11 percent had managed to move up to the upper income bracket .
at the other end of the scale , people on lower incomes - those with 70 percent less than the median - have increased significantly since 2000 to 25 percent of the german population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional families have been hard hit by the reforms one of the main casualties have been traditional families.the decline in the number of middle income families with children under the age of 16 has fallen by three million in 2006 .

but a stronger euro , coupled with rising labor costs and energy prices have dented the economic upswing . the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast for the third time in less than a year to 1.7 percent from 2 percent .
economy minister michael glos said the revision amounted to an appeal to avoid excessive wage accords . corporate profits from 2002-2006 have increased by roughly a third , however , compared to workers ' salaries according to the federal statistics office . the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- said real take-home pay had declined 3.5 per cent for salaried employees since the upswing began in the last quarter of 2004 . the federal statistical office -lrb- destatis -rrb- in a recent study said that just under 13 percent of the population in germany were at risk of poverty .

globalization and greater flexibility in the labor market are widening the gap between rich and poor . forbes magazine ranked 87-year-old karl albrecht , owner of the aldi discounter chain , as number 10 of the world 's richest people .
his wealth has been estimated at $ 27 billion -lrb- 17.7 billion euros -rrb- . albrecht has built his empire on providing food and clothing at knock-down prices to a chain of stores across europe .
but he might soon be losing most of his middle-income customers in germany as the country counts the cost of income inequality . joachim frick from the diw research institute blamed the hartz iv social benefit cutbacks and other social reforms introduced under former chancellor gerhard schröder as the main culprit . " long-term unemployment and more flexible and temporary working patterns have had an negative effect on the middle classes , " said frick . gap between rich and poor widening the german middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate according to a diw report , presenting a challenge to europe 's largest economy . the berlin-based diw research institute said the sharpest fall has been recorded in the number of " average earners " - that 's the group with an income of between 90 percent and 110 percent of the median income - who saw their income drop five percent .
the median income has been set at 16,200 euros , according to equivalized disposable income , and those under 11,340 euro are considered as living in poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can i afford this ?
in 1992 , more than 49 million belonged to the middle class and this figure , representing 62 percent of germany 's total population , remained constant until the end of the 20th century . by 2006 , the number of people in the middle class , dropped to 54 percent , or 44 million people , according to the study by the diw research institute . diw said the rich have become richer and the poor not only poorer but have also gained in size . " there is a bigger concentration on both ends of the scale , " the research institute said in a statement . " the incomes of those in the upper half of society grew faster than those in the lower half , which means that inequalities on the income scale grew , " it said . traditional families hard hit flexible labor patterns are also taking their toll : temporary jobs , part-time work , those self-employed who are dependent on one employer and so-called " one-euro jobs " for those receiving social security benefits . the study said that more than 11 percent had managed to move up to the upper income bracket .
at the other end of the scale , people on lower incomes - those with 70 percent less than the median - have increased significantly since 2000 to 25 percent of the german population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional families have been hard hit by the reforms one of the main casualties have been traditional families.the decline in the number of middle income families with children under the age of 16 has fallen by three million in 2006 .
but also one million people living in multi-generational households have seen their income fall into lower income bracket . economic upswing faltering germany has emerged from a period of stagnation to experience a mini-economic miracle over the last two years , largely thanks to stronger exports .
but a stronger euro , coupled with rising labor costs and energy prices have dented the economic upswing . the german government has lowered its 2008 growth forecast for the third time in less than a year to 1.7 percent from 2 percent .
economy minister michael glos said the revision amounted to an appeal to avoid excessive wage accords . corporate profits from 2002-2006 have increased by roughly a third , however , compared to workers ' salaries according to the federal statistics office . the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- said real take-home pay had declined 3.5 per cent for salaried employees since the upswing began in the last quarter of 2004 . the federal statistical office -lrb- destatis -rrb- in a recent study said that just under 13 percent of the population in germany were at risk of poverty .
according to the eu definition , the at-risk-of-poverty rate is the share of persons having to manage on less than 60 percent of their mean income of the entire population . that 's nearly 11 million , including 1.7 million children .
that 's less than most of the eu 's 27 member countries with only scandanavian countries achieving better results .
portugal and greece are bottom of the poverty league table . dw staff -lrb- nrt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he opened the antstore , a shop selling 60 species of the insect and all the accessories needed to set up a successful farm . now business is , if not booming , at least crawling along nicely . watching an ant colony can be a heady , even eerie , experience .
it offers a god 's-eye view ; a rare chance for a person to take in an entire , seething , struggling society at a glance . so it may be the philosophical-existential quality of ant-farming that attracts people to the antstore , which computer programmer martin sebesta opened some five years ago in berlin . or , it could be that people are increasingly looking for low-maintainance pets .
ants are easy to feed , suited to apartment life , and don ’ t shed or run up pricey vet bills . whatever the reason , anyone looking for a particular kind of ant has a good chance of finding it at the antstore .
the shop deals in over 60 types of the insect - mostly exotic breeds , from india , south america , australia and japan , among others . sebesta doesn ’ t only sell ant colonies and farms to walk-in customers .
he has a europe-wide internet mail-order business , and also provides creepy-crawlies for film and tv productions .
he even helped set up a zoo exhibit . for beginners , sebesta recommends weaver ants as being easy to care for .
a colony can live on in an apartment on an island set within a plastic tub of water - although “ you have to be careful that they don ’ t use their larvae to build a bridge over the water and crawl out , ” he warns . some breeds , like south american leaf cutters , may be more dramatic , but sebesta recomments them for experienced ant-farmers , as they need a lot of space .
likewise , bulldog ants – long , thin predatory insects that subsist only on living prey – are best kept by people experienced in the care of exotic animals . “ bulldog ants can see prey up to four meters -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- away , ” sebesta said .
“ you can even see them turn their head to watch you when you walk by . ” dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- is the biggest and most complex spacecraft europe has ever tried to put in orbit .
the 20-tonne unmanned freighter left the kourou spaceport at 0403 gmt , riding atop an ariane 5 rocket .
the spectacular night launch in the south american jungle was declared a success once the atv had separated from its booster 66 minutes after lift-off .
the news was cheered by a huge crowd of vips , space agency officials and representatives of the industrial teams that have worked on the development of the ship for past 11 years .
" with the launch of the atv , we are embarking on an extraordinary voyage , " reflected european space agency chief , jean jacques dordain .
" as of today , europe is an essential partner of the international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- . "
the atv is the largest , completely automated rendezvous and docking ship to go to the iss .
when it attaches to the platform on 3 april , it will do so without any human assistance .
the vessel will provide the largest refuelling and waste elimination capability for the iss ; and it is the only vehicle on the current timeline that will be able to de-orbit the $ 100bn platform when it is retired sometime towards the end of the next decade .
red button the launch was a significant event for ariane , too .
the european rocket had never before lifted so big a " passenger " .
its normal payload is a pair of commercial telecommunications satellites that weigh together less than 10 tonnes .

its upper-stage was also programmed to perform extra burns - the first to put the freighter in the correct 260km-high orbit , the second to take itself out of the sky and into the pacific ocean .
the atv has been dubbed " jules verne " for its maiden flight and is even carrying a first-edition hardback of the 19th-century french author 's book from the earth to the moon .
it will return on a space shuttle at a later date .
the atv will now essentially be parked in space .
it must wait until the us space shuttle endeavour has completed its forthcoming mission to the iss before moving in to make a docking .
the ship 's own computers will be in charge of the approach , employing an advanced form of gps and , in the latter stages , optical sensors to guide itself into the correct position on the end of the russian zvezda module .
astronauts on the station will only intervene - by pressing a red button on a panel - if they sense danger .
future applications " now we have a number of operations to do , " said robert laine , the technical and research director at eads astrium , which is the prime contractor on the atv .
" first , we have to deploy the solar panels , antennas , and check out everything .
then there will be a major operation in the next few days when we will test out what is known as the ' escape procedure ' , " he told bbc news .
" it will be as if the red button has been pressed , which tells the atv everything is lost and it must get out of the way .
this is a major milestone insisted on by the us space agency to prove the emergency systems work . "
the atv is the way europe will pay for its membership of the iss project .
four vehicles will follow this initial flight .
but the european space agency hopes its new ship will be more than just a high-flying heavy goods lorry .
the sophisticated automated systems onboard are expected to be transferred into many more spacecraft - especially those that require automatic rendezvous and docking .
this would include any mission that went to mars to try to retrieve rocks to bring back to earth laboratories .
the hardware that is used to lift the samples off the surface of the red planet would need to meet up in orbit with the propulsion unit which would carry it home .
the technology for this in-orbit assembly might be derived from atv know-how .
and there may even be a grander application - one not lost on the nasa chief mike griffin .
" it occurs to me that it 's a fairly short step to go from the atv to something which can carry crew , " he has observed .
" it needs an entry system to allow it to come back safely and crew accommodations instead of cargo payload .
but it seems to me that having a very fine launcher with the ariane 5 and a very fine space vehicle with the atv that it 's only a step from there to an independent , european manned-spaceflight capability ; and i for one would like to see it . "

the court accepted opposition claims there were some violations but said this could not call into question the entire poll .
the original announcement that armenian prime minister serzh sarkisian had won sparked days of protests .
the government declared a 20-day state of emergency on 1 march as eight protestors died in clashes with police .
public gatherings have been banned and restrictions placed on the media .
official election results in armenia gave serzh sarkisian 53 % of the vote , and the main opposition candidate levon ter-petrosian 21.5 % .
mr ter-petrosian had alleged there was widespread fraud at the poll , but his legal appeal was rejected .
the outgoing president , robert kocharian , has warned that the authorities will not tolerate any more mass demonstrations even after the state of emergency is over .
the bbc 's matthew collin says a small group of female opposition supporters defied the measures on saturday when they dressed in black and laid flowers where the clashes had taken place , in memory of those who died .

his remains are thought to be among those of executed prisoners found on the site of an abandoned prison in the southern city of melbourne .
kelly was a bank robber who was hanged in 1880 for murdering three policemen .
after evading arrest for several years , he used home-made armour in a final shoot-out with police ; his exploits have been the subject of several films .
the scene of his last stand has also been designated a national heritage site .
kelly 's story divides modern australians , says the bbc 's phil mercer in sydney .
some see him as a folk hero , who fought the colonial british establishment , others simply as a violent criminal .
either way , the irish convict 's son 's daring bank robberies and escapes made him a legend .
guns blazing after two years on the run , police finally caught up with kelly and his gang .
the outlaw made his own armour by beating plough blades into shape and walked towards police with guns blazing .
he was shot 20 times but survived .
he was hanged for his crimes in 1880 and buried in a mass grave at the old melbourne gaol , but the whereabouts of his body has remained a mystery .
his remains , and those of others , were thought to have been reburied half a century later at pentridge prison in melbourne .
archaeologists say they have now found the remains of 32 bodies in coffins in various states of decomposition .
the bodies will now be subject to forensic tests .
" we believe we have conclusively found the burial site , but that is very different from finding the remains , " jeremy smith , senior archaeologist with heritage victoria , told reuters .
" if the remains exist , then we will have found them . "

his remains are thought to be among those of executed prisoners found on the site of an abandoned prison in the southern city of melbourne .
kelly was a bank robber who was hanged in 1880 for murdering three policemen .
after evading arrest for several years , he used home-made armour in a final shoot-out with police ; his exploits have been the subject of several films .
the scene of his last stand has also been designated a national heritage site .
kelly 's story divides modern australians , says the bbc 's phil mercer in sydney .
some see him as a folk hero , who fought the colonial british establishment , others simply as a violent criminal .
either way , the irish convict 's son 's daring bank robberies and escapes made him a legend .
guns blazing after two years on the run , police finally caught up with kelly and his gang .
the outlaw made his own armour by beating plough blades into shape and walked towards police with guns blazing .
he was shot 20 times but survived .
he was hanged for his crimes in 1880 and buried in a mass grave at the old melbourne gaol , but the whereabouts of his body has remained a mystery .
his remains , and those of others , were thought to have been reburied half a century later at pentridge prison in melbourne .
archaeologists say they have now found the remains of 32 bodies in coffins in various states of decomposition .
the bodies will now be subject to forensic tests .
" we believe we have conclusively found the burial site , but that is very different from finding the remains , " jeremy smith , senior archaeologist with heritage victoria , told reuters .
" if the remains exist , then we will have found them . "

the national front lost its two-thirds majority in parliament - its worst result since independence in 1957 .
but it did get 139 mps in the 222-seat body , giving it a simple majority .
many voters from ethnic minorities - indians and chinese - who make up more than a third of the population , failed to turn out for the coalition .
' wrong choice ' concern about a government failure to tackle renewed ethnic tension is one of the main reasons for the upset , says the bbc 's robin brant in kuala lumpur .
mahathir mohamad says the pm should step down many of the coalition 's malay supporters abandoned it too .
among those calling for mr abdullah to quit is his predecessor , mahathir mohamad , who accused him of destroying the united malays organisation -lrb- umno -rrb- , the largest party in the national front alliance .
mr mahathir , who chose mr abdullah as his successor more than five years ago , said he had made the wrong choice .
" i think he should accept responsibility for this .
he should accept 100 % responsibility , " he said .
' no pressure ' mr abdullah responded to calls for his resignation by telling reporters : " there is no pressure at this time . "
he also urged calm , amid fears there may be violence in the wake of the result .
this is a defining moment , unprecedented in our nation 's history anwar ibrahim , justice party mr abdullah plans to meet the monarch on monday to seek the oath of office , his spokesman said .
the opposition now has control of an unprecedented number of seats in parliament - more than 80 .
before the election , it held 19 .
more than 30 went to opposition figure anwar ibrahim and his justice party .
he hailed the result as a message that it was time for change in malaysia .
" this is a defining moment , unprecedented in our nation 's history .
today a new chapter has opened . "
sunday 's edition of the star newspaper in malaysia dubbed the result a " political tsunami " .
the election also saw more state legislatures come under opposition control .
before the poll only kelantan had an opposition administration .
the election commission confirmed opposition wins in kelantan as well as selangor , perak , kedah and penang .

the national front lost its two-thirds majority in parliament - its worst result since independence in 1957 .
but it did get 139 mps in the 222-seat body , giving it a simple majority .
many voters from ethnic minorities - indians and chinese - who make up more than a third of the population , failed to turn out for the coalition .
' wrong choice ' concern about a government failure to tackle renewed ethnic tension is one of the main reasons for the upset , says the bbc 's robin brant in kuala lumpur .
mahathir mohamad says the pm should step down many of the coalition 's malay supporters abandoned it too .
among those calling for mr abdullah to quit is his predecessor , mahathir mohamad , who accused him of destroying the united malays organisation -lrb- umno -rrb- , the largest party in the national front alliance .
mr mahathir , who chose mr abdullah as his successor more than five years ago , said he had made the wrong choice .
" i think he should accept responsibility for this .
he should accept 100 % responsibility , " he said .
' no pressure ' mr abdullah responded to calls for his resignation by telling reporters : " there is no pressure at this time . "
he also urged calm , amid fears there may be violence in the wake of the result .
this is a defining moment , unprecedented in our nation 's history anwar ibrahim , justice party mr abdullah plans to meet the monarch on monday to seek the oath of office , his spokesman said .
the opposition now has control of an unprecedented number of seats in parliament - more than 80 .
before the election , it held 19 .
more than 30 went to opposition figure anwar ibrahim and his justice party .
he hailed the result as a message that it was time for change in malaysia .
" this is a defining moment , unprecedented in our nation 's history .
today a new chapter has opened . "
sunday 's edition of the star newspaper in malaysia dubbed the result a " political tsunami " .
the election also saw more state legislatures come under opposition control .
before the poll only kelantan had an opposition administration .

the main rate is due to fall from 30 % to 28 % in april , but shadow chancellor george osborne wants it cut to 25 % .
speaking ahead of chancellor alistair darling 's first budget on wednesday , he said he also wanted to scrap a planned 2 % rise in the small companies rate .
mr osborne told the bbc that the tories planned to pay for this by scrapping a number of business tax breaks .
i do not want to see alistair darling on wednesday use either the environment or binge drinking as an excuse for additional taxes george osborne , shadow chancellor interviewed on the andrew marr show , mr osborne said that there was currently " no scope " for a big cut in the business taxes because of the uk 's budget deficit , which he described as the worst in europe .
simplification he said : " so i am suggesting a simplification of the system , getting rid of the very expensive reliefs and allowances that exist within the corporate tax system , and using the proceeds to cut the headline rate . "
mr osborne said the tories also wanted to keep the business tax rate at 20p for small companies .
the bbc 's political correspondent ben wright said the conservatives planned for overall business tax levels to stay the same - meaning the package would be less politically contentious .
he said the business lobby had been critical of the government in recent months and it was a group the conservatives were keen to court .
mainstream corporation tax rate is currently paid on annual profits of more than £ 1.5m.
further reduction this april , businesses will see the main rate fall from 30p to 28p , as announced in gordon brown 's last budget in march 2007 , but the tories believe that there is a good case case for a further reduction .
mr osborne also warned the chancellor not to bring in " stealth taxes " when he targets environmentally-unfriendly behaviour and binge drinking in the budget .
he said : " what we are saying is if you increase taxes on 4x4s or alcopops then you should reduce taxes elsewhere , " he said .
" i do not want to see alistair darling on wednesday use either the environment or binge drinking as an excuse for additional taxes . "

lib dem leaders have traditionally made proportional representation the price of a deal with other parties in the event of a hung parliament .
but in his first speech as leader , mr clegg went further by demanding a shake-up of the whole political system .
he also flagged up the possibility of the lib dems offering tax cuts at the next general election .
" if we want a better britain , with opportunity for everyone , we 've got to have fair taxes . "
cutting income tax by 4p in the pound is a great start " nick clegg john pienaar 's view on clegg " cutting income tax by 4p in the pound is a great start .
" but we must never stop thinking about how we make taxes fairer . "
the party is considering a tax on the homes of the super rich to pay for cuts lower down the income scale .
mr clegg received a three-minute standing ovation for his speech at the party 's spring conference in liverpool .
he spoke for more than 50 minutes without notes , overcoming a few initial signs of nervousness to deliver an impassioned plea for political change .
he told delegates electoral reform " was n't enough " and he wanted to " redesign " britain 's political system for the 21st century .
the speech was being sold as an attempt to move on from a damaging row over the eu treaty which saw the resignation last week of three frontbenchers . "
i will never allow the liberal democrats to be a mere annexe to another party " nick clegg views on clegg speech mr clegg joked that if the party had wanted to rebel in the past they would have had to " borrow mps from the other parties " .
but he made no further mention of the eu treaty debate , focusing instead on portraying the lib dems as an " anti-establishment " force that can smash britain 's two-party system .
he called for a new crackdown on sleaze - with by-elections for mps who break the rules .
and he vowed to fight for an " end to big money politics " - proposing a £ 25,000 limit on political donations .
he also addressed the question of alliances with other parties head-on , saying he would never join a conservative or a labour government .
" i will never allow the liberal democrats to be a mere annexe to another party .

aides refused to be drawn on the precise details of the new " pluralistic " government mr clegg wanted .
but they said the party was no longer interested in having a " few cabinet ministers sitting in a tory or labour government " - but wanted a constitutional convention to examine all aspects of how britain is governed .
mr clegg also focused on education and health in his speech - issues he believes matter more to ordinary voters than europe .
he also pledged to build a " people 's nhs " with treatment within a specified waiting time or guaranteed private care .
in his speech , mr clegg mounted a sustained attack on his political opponents .

lib dem leaders have traditionally made proportional representation the price of a deal with other parties in the event of a hung parliament .

" but we must never stop thinking about how we make taxes fairer . "

mr clegg received a three-minute standing ovation for his speech at the party 's spring conference in liverpool .
he spoke for more than 50 minutes without notes , overcoming a few initial signs of nervousness to deliver an impassioned plea for political change .
he told delegates electoral reform " was n't enough " and he wanted to " redesign " britain 's political system for the 21st century .
the speech was being sold as an attempt to move on from a damaging row over the eu treaty which saw the resignation last week of three frontbenchers .

but he made no further mention of the eu treaty debate , focusing instead on portraying the lib dems as an " anti-establishment " force that can smash britain 's two-party system .
he called for a new crackdown on sleaze - with by-elections for mps who break the rules .
and he vowed to fight for an " end to big money politics " - proposing a £ 25,000 limit on political donations .
he also addressed the question of alliances with other parties head-on , saying he would never join a conservative or a labour government .

coastbound lanes in kent were partly closed for six days due to an ongoing strike by seafrance ferry workers .
the m20 between junctions eight and nine was reopened after the backlog of lorries heading to france was cleared .
however , police warn the closure could be reinstated amid fears the forecasted stormy weather could shut dover port .
the strike by seafrance workers has now entered its 11th day , with further action planned this week .
lorry park proposal as result , freight traffic has had to use the channel tunnel and other ferry operators to reach france .
non-commercial traffic heading for dover , folkestone and eurotunnel is still being advised to use the a2 and m2 diversions to avoid delays .
kent police said it would review the situation on sunday night when severe gales are forecast to hit the uk , coupled with heavier freight traffic .
the freight transport association has estimated the disruption caused by the french industrial action has cost £ 500,000 a day .
director of external affairs , geoff dossetter , said the current bill stood between £ 4m and £ 5m , with delays to lorry drivers averaging four hours .
" all transport costs inevitably have to be paid by the consumer , " he warned .

coastbound lanes in kent were partly closed for six days due to an ongoing strike by seafrance ferry workers .
the m20 between junctions eight and nine was reopened after the backlog of lorries heading to france was cleared .
however , police warn the closure could be reinstated amid fears the forecasted stormy weather could shut dover port .
the strike by seafrance workers has now entered its 11th day , with further action planned this week .
lorry park proposal as result , freight traffic has had to use the channel tunnel and other ferry operators to reach france .
non-commercial traffic heading for dover , folkestone and eurotunnel is still being advised to use the a2 and m2 diversions to avoid delays .
kent police said it would review the situation on sunday night when severe gales are forecast to hit the uk , coupled with heavier freight traffic .
the freight transport association has estimated the disruption caused by the french industrial action has cost £ 500,000 a day .
director of external affairs , geoff dossetter , said the current bill stood between £ 4m and £ 5m , with delays to lorry drivers averaging four hours .
" all transport costs inevitably have to be paid by the consumer , " he warned .
kent county council has confirmed it will reveal plans this week for a preferred location for a semi-permanent lorry park to ease the pressures caused by operation stack .

many ancient woodlands across the county have disappeared under housing developments , roads and railways .
overlaying maps on existing landscapes reveals remains of towns , villages and countryside features from 1843 to 1893 .
the ancient tree hunt aims to record at least 100,000 surviving old trees throughout the uk by 2011 .
one of cambridgeshire 's oldest trees is near witcham , just off the a142 to the west of ely .
' fascinating glimpse ' this veteran ash tree with a 2.1metre -lrb- 7ft 8in -rrb- girth may have been part of a hedge in its early life .
it stands on the edge of the bury road as a reminder of an ancient boundary .
" the maps are helping us identify some of the best places to search for remaining ancient trees , " nikki williams , project manager for the ancient tree hunt , said .
" people joining the ancient tree hunt can step back in time to see former landscapes of parks , gardens and tree-lined avenues .
" these are strong clues to find surviving ancient trees as well as a fascinating glimpse of local history . "
" the old maps show us exactly where larger concentrations of trees once stood , " she added .
