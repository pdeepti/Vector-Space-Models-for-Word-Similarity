the csu has held an absolute majority in bavaria since 1962 and won 60.7 percent of the vote in the last state election in 2004 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years and will now be forced to look for a coalition partner . " we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " she said in reference to the party 's stated intention of retaining its absolute majority in the alpine state . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which governs in a grand coalition with the cdu in berlin , polled around 18.9 percent , even less than in the last state election .
it is the party 's worst result in its history in the state . small parties profit among the smaller parties , the conservative free voters entered the state parliament in munich for the first time with 10.2 percent and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fpd -rrb- were back after an absence of 14 years with 7.8 percent . the environmentalist greens won 9.1 percent , but the pro-labor left party was hovering below the 5 percent needed for parliamentary representation . the csu 's heavy losses could signal a weakening of support for the conservative camp and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september next year . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power at the head of a grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . unhappy voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber -lrb- left -rrb- and beckstein conceded heavy losses while bavarian premier guenther beckstein , 64 , had still voiced his optimism about the election outcome earlier in the day , he conceded the heavy losses after polling ended . " i am ready to lead a coalition government as well , " said beckstein , who was elected premier last year after stoiber was toppled in a party rebellion . " the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to munich airport and a controversial smoking ban have led to voter discontent with the leadership duo of beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . the csu 's most likely coalition partner is now the fdp .

the csu has held an absolute majority in bavaria since 1962 and won 60.7 percent of the vote in the last state election in 2004 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years and will now be forced to look for a coalition partner . " we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " she said in reference to the party 's stated intention of retaining its absolute majority in the alpine state . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which governs in a grand coalition with the cdu in berlin , polled around 18.9 percent , even less than in the last state election .
it is the party 's worst result in its history in the state . small parties profit among the smaller parties , the conservative free voters entered the state parliament in munich for the first time with 10.2 percent and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fpd -rrb- were back after an absence of 14 years with 7.8 percent . the environmentalist greens won 9.1 percent , but the pro-labor left party was hovering below the 5 percent needed for parliamentary representation . the csu 's heavy losses could signal a weakening of support for the conservative camp and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september next year . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power at the head of a grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . unhappy voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber -lrb- left -rrb- and beckstein conceded heavy losses while bavarian premier guenther beckstein , 64 , had still voiced his optimism about the election outcome earlier in the day , he conceded the heavy losses after polling ended .

" the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to munich airport and a controversial smoking ban have led to voter discontent with the leadership duo of beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . the csu 's most likely coalition partner is now the fdp .

the csu has held an absolute majority in bavaria since 1962 and won 60.7 percent of the vote in the last state election in 2004 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years and will now be forced to look for a coalition partner . " we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " she said in reference to the party 's stated intention of retaining its absolute majority in the alpine state . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which governs in a grand coalition with the cdu in berlin , polled around 18.9 percent , even less than in the last state election .
it is the party 's worst result in its history in the state . small parties profit among the smaller parties , the conservative free voters entered the state parliament in munich for the first time with 10.2 percent and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fpd -rrb- were back after an absence of 14 years with 7.8 percent . the environmentalist greens won 9.1 percent , but the pro-labor left party was hovering below the 5 percent needed for parliamentary representation . the csu 's heavy losses could signal a weakening of support for the conservative camp and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september next year . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power at the head of a grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . unhappy voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber -lrb- left -rrb- and beckstein conceded heavy losses while bavarian premier guenther beckstein , 64 , had still voiced his optimism about the election outcome earlier in the day , he conceded the heavy losses after polling ended . " i am ready to lead a coalition government as well , " said beckstein , who was elected premier last year after stoiber was toppled in a party rebellion . " the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to munich airport and a controversial smoking ban have led to voter discontent with the leadership duo of beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . the csu 's most likely coalition partner is now the fdp .
another possibility is the free voters .

the csu has held an absolute majority in bavaria since 1962 and won 60.7 percent of the vote in the last state election in 2004 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years and will now be forced to look for a coalition partner . " we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " she said in reference to the party 's stated intention of retaining its absolute majority in the alpine state . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which governs in a grand coalition with the cdu in berlin , polled around 18.9 percent , even less than in the last state election .
it is the party 's worst result in its history in the state . small parties profit among the smaller parties , the conservative free voters entered the state parliament in munich for the first time with 10.2 percent and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fpd -rrb- were back after an absence of 14 years with 7.8 percent . the environmentalist greens won 9.1 percent , but the pro-labor left party was hovering below the 5 percent needed for parliamentary representation . the csu 's heavy losses could signal a weakening of support for the conservative camp and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september next year . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power at the head of a grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . unhappy voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber -lrb- left -rrb- and beckstein conceded heavy losses while bavarian premier guenther beckstein , 64 , had still voiced his optimism about the election outcome earlier in the day , he conceded the heavy losses after polling ended .

the csu has held an absolute majority in bavaria since 1962 and won 60.7 percent of the vote in the last state election in 2004 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years and will now be forced to look for a coalition partner . " we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " she said in reference to the party 's stated intention of retaining its absolute majority in the alpine state . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which governs in a grand coalition with the cdu in berlin , polled around 18.9 percent , even less than in the last state election .
it is the party 's worst result in its history in the state . small parties profit among the smaller parties , the conservative free voters entered the state parliament in munich for the first time with 10.2 percent and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fpd -rrb- were back after an absence of 14 years with 7.8 percent . the environmentalist greens won 9.1 percent , but the pro-labor left party was hovering below the 5 percent needed for parliamentary representation . the csu 's heavy losses could signal a weakening of support for the conservative camp and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september next year . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power at the head of a grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . unhappy voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber -lrb- left -rrb- and beckstein conceded heavy losses while bavarian premier guenther beckstein , 64 , had still voiced his optimism about the election outcome earlier in the day , he conceded the heavy losses after polling ended . " i am ready to lead a coalition government as well , " said beckstein , who was elected premier last year after stoiber was toppled in a party rebellion . " the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to munich airport and a controversial smoking ban have led to voter discontent with the leadership duo of beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . the csu 's most likely coalition partner is now the fdp .
another possibility is the free voters .
while technically a possibility , a coalition of the four smaller parties , including the spd and the greens , is highly unlikely as at least the fdp has already said that it is not willing to consider this . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

forming a government wo n't be easy . projections after a tally of more than 80 percent of the ballots showed austria 's social democratic party in the lead in the country 's parliamentary elections sunday , but the real winners were two far-right parties which together won 29 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faymann -lrb- rights -rrb- has good chances to succeed current chancellor alfred gusenbauer -lrb- left -rrb- according to early official results , social democratic party -lrb- spoe -rrb- leader werner faymann was set to take over the chancellorship by winning 29.7 percent , six percent less than in the last elections in 2006 . the centrist conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- , the spoe 's junior partner in the coalition that ended in july , were projected at 25.6 percent , suffering massive losses of nine percent . far-right gains in contrast to the governing parties ' record low results , the far-right freedom party -lrb- fpoe -rrb- and alliance for the future of austria -lrb- bzoe -rrb- won around 18 percent and 11 percent of the ballots respectively . while the freedom party led by heinz-christian strache gained seven percent , joerg haider 's alliance more than doubled its votes to 11 percent , from 4 percent in 2006 . the election result showed that austrians did not want another coalition between social democrats and conservatives , haider said . spoe and oevp are not keen on another round of cooperation , but they might have few other options if they keep their promises not to govern with the far right . " i can not imagine a government with bzoe or fpoe , " said social democratic leader fayman , who also ruled out a minority government with the support of the extreme right in parliament . unwanted coalition freedom party leader strache said sunday that the social democrats should reconsider its " fetish for exclusion " of other parties . " the grand coalition is dead , " haider said .
" there must be a different solution . " but the social democrats ' options were unclear as conservative leader molterer did not rule out an opposition role for his party after this " painful defeat . " the green party lost around one percent and is projected at 11 percent of the vote . the official final result will be announced on oct .

the csu has held an absolute majority in bavaria since 1962 and won 60.7 percent of the vote in the last state election in 2004 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years and will now be forced to look for a coalition partner . " we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " she said in reference to the party 's stated intention of retaining its absolute majority in the alpine state . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which governs in a grand coalition with the cdu in berlin , polled around 18.9 percent , even less than in the last state election .

the csu has held an absolute majority in bavaria since 1962 and won 60.7 percent of the vote in the last state election in 2004 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years and will now be forced to look for a coalition partner . " we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " she said in reference to the party 's stated intention of retaining its absolute majority in the alpine state . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which governs in a grand coalition with the cdu in berlin , polled around 18.9 percent , even less than in the last state election .
it is the party 's worst result in its history in the state . small parties profit among the smaller parties , the conservative free voters entered the state parliament in munich for the first time with 10.2 percent and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fpd -rrb- were back after an absence of 14 years with 7.8 percent . the environmentalist greens won 9.1 percent , but the pro-labor left party was hovering below the 5 percent needed for parliamentary representation . the csu 's heavy losses could signal a weakening of support for the conservative camp and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september next year . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power at the head of a grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . unhappy voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber -lrb- left -rrb- and beckstein conceded heavy losses while bavarian premier guenther beckstein , 64 , had still voiced his optimism about the election outcome earlier in the day , he conceded the heavy losses after polling ended . " i am ready to lead a coalition government as well , " said beckstein , who was elected premier last year after stoiber was toppled in a party rebellion . " the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to munich airport and a controversial smoking ban have led to voter discontent with the leadership duo of beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . the csu 's most likely coalition partner is now the fdp .

the csu has held an absolute majority in bavaria since 1962 and won 60.7 percent of the vote in the last state election in 2004 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years and will now be forced to look for a coalition partner . " we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " she said in reference to the party 's stated intention of retaining its absolute majority in the alpine state . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which governs in a grand coalition with the cdu in berlin , polled around 18.9 percent , even less than in the last state election .
it is the party 's worst result in its history in the state . small parties profit among the smaller parties , the conservative free voters entered the state parliament in munich for the first time with 10.2 percent and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fpd -rrb- were back after an absence of 14 years with 7.8 percent . the environmentalist greens won 9.1 percent , but the pro-labor left party was hovering below the 5 percent needed for parliamentary representation . the csu 's heavy losses could signal a weakening of support for the conservative camp and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september next year . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power at the head of a grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . unhappy voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber -lrb- left -rrb- and beckstein conceded heavy losses while bavarian premier guenther beckstein , 64 , had still voiced his optimism about the election outcome earlier in the day , he conceded the heavy losses after polling ended . " i am ready to lead a coalition government as well , " said beckstein , who was elected premier last year after stoiber was toppled in a party rebellion . " the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to munich airport and a controversial smoking ban have led to voter discontent with the leadership duo of beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . the csu 's most likely coalition partner is now the fdp .
another possibility is the free voters .
while technically a possibility , a coalition of the four smaller parties , including the spd and the greens , is highly unlikely as at least the fdp has already said that it is not willing to consider this . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the csu has held an absolute majority in bavaria since 1962 and won 60.7 percent of the vote in the last state election in 2004 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years and will now be forced to look for a coalition partner . " we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " she said in reference to the party 's stated intention of retaining its absolute majority in the alpine state . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which governs in a grand coalition with the cdu in berlin , polled around 18.9 percent , even less than in the last state election .
it is the party 's worst result in its history in the state . small parties profit among the smaller parties , the conservative free voters entered the state parliament in munich for the first time with 10.2 percent and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fpd -rrb- were back after an absence of 14 years with 7.8 percent . the environmentalist greens won 9.1 percent , but the pro-labor left party was hovering below the 5 percent needed for parliamentary representation . the csu 's heavy losses could signal a weakening of support for the conservative camp and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september next year . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power at the head of a grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . unhappy voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber -lrb- left -rrb- and beckstein conceded heavy losses while bavarian premier guenther beckstein , 64 , had still voiced his optimism about the election outcome earlier in the day , he conceded the heavy losses after polling ended . " i am ready to lead a coalition government as well , " said beckstein , who was elected premier last year after stoiber was toppled in a party rebellion . " the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to munich airport and a controversial smoking ban have led to voter discontent with the leadership duo of beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . the csu 's most likely coalition partner is now the fdp .
another possibility is the free voters .
while technically a possibility , a coalition of the four smaller parties , including the spd and the greens , is highly unlikely as at least the fdp has already said that it is not willing to consider this . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

forming a government wo n't be easy . projections after a tally of more than 80 percent of the ballots showed austria 's social democratic party in the lead in the country 's parliamentary elections sunday , but the real winners were two far-right parties which together won 29 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faymann -lrb- rights -rrb- has good chances to succeed current chancellor alfred gusenbauer -lrb- left -rrb- according to early official results , social democratic party -lrb- spoe -rrb- leader werner faymann was set to take over the chancellorship by winning 29.7 percent , six percent less than in the last elections in 2006 . the centrist conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- , the spoe 's junior partner in the coalition that ended in july , were projected at 25.6 percent , suffering massive losses of nine percent . far-right gains in contrast to the governing parties ' record low results , the far-right freedom party -lrb- fpoe -rrb- and alliance for the future of austria -lrb- bzoe -rrb- won around 18 percent and 11 percent of the ballots respectively . while the freedom party led by heinz-christian strache gained seven percent , joerg haider 's alliance more than doubled its votes to 11 percent , from 4 percent in 2006 . the election result showed that austrians did not want another coalition between social democrats and conservatives , haider said . spoe and oevp are not keen on another round of cooperation , but they might have few other options if they keep their promises not to govern with the far right . " i can not imagine a government with bzoe or fpoe , " said social democratic leader fayman , who also ruled out a minority government with the support of the extreme right in parliament . unwanted coalition freedom party leader strache said sunday that the social democrats should reconsider its " fetish for exclusion " of other parties . " the grand coalition is dead , " haider said .
" there must be a different solution . " but the social democrats ' options were unclear as conservative leader molterer did not rule out an opposition role for his party after this " painful defeat . " the green party lost around one percent and is projected at 11 percent of the vote . the official final result will be announced on oct .

the csu has held an absolute majority in bavaria since 1962 and won 60.7 percent of the vote in the last state election in 2004 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years and will now be forced to look for a coalition partner . " we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " she said in reference to the party 's stated intention of retaining its absolute majority in the alpine state . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which governs in a grand coalition with the cdu in berlin , polled around 18.9 percent , even less than in the last state election .
it is the party 's worst result in its history in the state . small parties profit among the smaller parties , the conservative free voters entered the state parliament in munich for the first time with 10.2 percent and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fpd -rrb- were back after an absence of 14 years with 7.8 percent . the environmentalist greens won 9.1 percent , but the pro-labor left party was hovering below the 5 percent needed for parliamentary representation . the csu 's heavy losses could signal a weakening of support for the conservative camp and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september next year . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power at the head of a grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . unhappy voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber -lrb- left -rrb- and beckstein conceded heavy losses while bavarian premier guenther beckstein , 64 , had still voiced his optimism about the election outcome earlier in the day , he conceded the heavy losses after polling ended . " i am ready to lead a coalition government as well , " said beckstein , who was elected premier last year after stoiber was toppled in a party rebellion . " the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to munich airport and a controversial smoking ban have led to voter discontent with the leadership duo of beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . the csu 's most likely coalition partner is now the fdp .
another possibility is the free voters .
while technically a possibility , a coalition of the four smaller parties , including the spd and the greens , is highly unlikely as at least the fdp has already said that it is not willing to consider this . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the csu has held an absolute majority in bavaria since 1962 and won 60.7 percent of the vote in the last state election in 2004 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years and will now be forced to look for a coalition partner . " we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " she said in reference to the party 's stated intention of retaining its absolute majority in the alpine state . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which governs in a grand coalition with the cdu in berlin , polled around 18.9 percent , even less than in the last state election .
it is the party 's worst result in its history in the state . small parties profit among the smaller parties , the conservative free voters entered the state parliament in munich for the first time with 10.2 percent and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fpd -rrb- were back after an absence of 14 years with 7.8 percent . the environmentalist greens won 9.1 percent , but the pro-labor left party was hovering below the 5 percent needed for parliamentary representation . the csu 's heavy losses could signal a weakening of support for the conservative camp and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september next year . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power at the head of a grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . unhappy voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber -lrb- left -rrb- and beckstein conceded heavy losses while bavarian premier guenther beckstein , 64 , had still voiced his optimism about the election outcome earlier in the day , he conceded the heavy losses after polling ended . " i am ready to lead a coalition government as well , " said beckstein , who was elected premier last year after stoiber was toppled in a party rebellion . " the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to munich airport and a controversial smoking ban have led to voter discontent with the leadership duo of beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . the csu 's most likely coalition partner is now the fdp .
another possibility is the free voters .

the csu has held an absolute majority in bavaria since 1962 and won 60.7 percent of the vote in the last state election in 2004 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years and will now be forced to look for a coalition partner . " we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " she said in reference to the party 's stated intention of retaining its absolute majority in the alpine state . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which governs in a grand coalition with the cdu in berlin , polled around 18.9 percent , even less than in the last state election .
it is the party 's worst result in its history in the state . small parties profit among the smaller parties , the conservative free voters entered the state parliament in munich for the first time with 10.2 percent and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fpd -rrb- were back after an absence of 14 years with 7.8 percent . the environmentalist greens won 9.1 percent , but the pro-labor left party was hovering below the 5 percent needed for parliamentary representation . the csu 's heavy losses could signal a weakening of support for the conservative camp and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september next year . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power at the head of a grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . unhappy voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber -lrb- left -rrb- and beckstein conceded heavy losses while bavarian premier guenther beckstein , 64 , had still voiced his optimism about the election outcome earlier in the day , he conceded the heavy losses after polling ended . " i am ready to lead a coalition government as well , " said beckstein , who was elected premier last year after stoiber was toppled in a party rebellion . " the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to munich airport and a controversial smoking ban have led to voter discontent with the leadership duo of beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . the csu 's most likely coalition partner is now the fdp .
another possibility is the free voters .
while technically a possibility , a coalition of the four smaller parties , including the spd and the greens , is highly unlikely as at least the fdp has already said that it is not willing to consider this . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the csu has held an absolute majority in bavaria since 1962 and won 60.7 percent of the vote in the last state election in 2004 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years and will now be forced to look for a coalition partner . " we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " she said in reference to the party 's stated intention of retaining its absolute majority in the alpine state . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which governs in a grand coalition with the cdu in berlin , polled around 18.9 percent , even less than in the last state election .

the csu has held an absolute majority in bavaria since 1962 and won 60.7 percent of the vote in the last state election in 2004 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years and will now be forced to look for a coalition partner . " we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " she said in reference to the party 's stated intention of retaining its absolute majority in the alpine state . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which governs in a grand coalition with the cdu in berlin , polled around 18.9 percent , even less than in the last state election .
it is the party 's worst result in its history in the state . small parties profit among the smaller parties , the conservative free voters entered the state parliament in munich for the first time with 10.2 percent and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fpd -rrb- were back after an absence of 14 years with 7.8 percent . the environmentalist greens won 9.1 percent , but the pro-labor left party was hovering below the 5 percent needed for parliamentary representation . the csu 's heavy losses could signal a weakening of support for the conservative camp and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september next year . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power at the head of a grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . unhappy voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber -lrb- left -rrb- and beckstein conceded heavy losses while bavarian premier guenther beckstein , 64 , had still voiced his optimism about the election outcome earlier in the day , he conceded the heavy losses after polling ended . " i am ready to lead a coalition government as well , " said beckstein , who was elected premier last year after stoiber was toppled in a party rebellion . " the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to munich airport and a controversial smoking ban have led to voter discontent with the leadership duo of beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . the csu 's most likely coalition partner is now the fdp .
another possibility is the free voters .

the savoy theatre in monmouth , which has a 400-seat cinema , enjoyed packed houses throughout a recent two-week run of the film featuring abba songs .
the charitable trust which runs the venue said the money generated should keep them going into next year .
it is calling on the public for support through volunteering and attendance .
vic bignell , the savoy trust 's director , said mamma mia , which stars meryl streep and pierce brosnan , might have been the last film shown in the cinema if it had not been attended so well .
he said the trust had no subsidies from the local council and relied entirely on people coming into the cinema as well as volunteers to help run it .
before mamma mia ! hit the big screen , the savoy was not attracting big enough audiences to make it viable despite showing the latest film releases , he said . "
everyone who sees the inside of the cinema now falls in love with it " vic bignell , savoy trust 's director " it was a vicious circle , " said mr bignell .
" we had very few people coming to see the films , and therefore no money for advertising and then even less people through the box office .
" but because of mamma mia ! we have been able to afford to advertise more , which brought us higher attendances and more volunteers to help us run the place .
" we 're now planning to start running a mother and baby club and a pensioner 's club .
" we always wanted to be a theatre which was at the heart of the community but we could n't afford the staff to do the extra hours .
" now thanks to mamma mia ! we have around 20 volunteers all coming in at different times of the week to help run the cinema .
" but we 're always looking for more volunteers , even if it 's only to drop round leaflets .
" the projectionist stayed on when we took over the savoy and is also a volunteer .
he has two other jobs to keep him going . "
the trust took over the savoy theatre in 2006 with the initial aim of saving the grade ii listed building .
' looking comfortable ' they refurbished the venue with the help of a grant from the welsh development agency , replacing seats , reopening the circle and installing equipment .
" it was very run down when we took over because the people before us had very little money , " said mr bignell .
" but everyone who sees the inside of the cinema now falls in love with it .
" at the moment the way things are looking , we are looking comfortable going into next year . "
the savoy will be showing the sing-a-long version of mamma mia ! from 16-18 october .
in addition to the cinema , its savoy players and youth theatre groups put on their own amateur productions .

the savoy theatre in monmouth , which has a 400-seat cinema , enjoyed packed houses throughout a recent two-week run of the film featuring abba songs .
the charitable trust which runs the venue said the money generated should keep them going into next year .
it is calling on the public for support through volunteering and attendance .
vic bignell , the savoy trust 's director , said mamma mia , which stars meryl streep and pierce brosnan , might have been the last film shown in the cinema if it had not been attended so well .
he said the trust had no subsidies from the local council and relied entirely on people coming into the cinema as well as volunteers to help run it .
before mamma mia ! hit the big screen , the savoy was not attracting big enough audiences to make it viable despite showing the latest film releases , he said .
everyone who sees the inside of the cinema now falls in love with it vic bignell , savoy trust 's director " it was a vicious circle , " said mr bignell .
" we had very few people coming to see the films , and therefore no money for advertising and then even less people through the box office .
" but because of mamma mia ! we have been able to afford to advertise more , which brought us higher attendances and more volunteers to help us run the place .
" we 're now planning to start running a mother and baby club and a pensioner 's club .
" we always wanted to be a theatre which was at the heart of the community but we could n't afford the staff to do the extra hours .
" now thanks to mamma mia ! we have around 20 volunteers all coming in at different times of the week to help run the cinema .
" but we 're always looking for more volunteers , even if it 's only to drop round leaflets .
" the projectionist stayed on when we took over the savoy and is also a volunteer .

a type of " cultural despair " has led " long-term inhabitants " and newer arrivals to feel alienated and unsure of uk values , he told the guardian .
mr grieve , speaking on the eve of the conservative party conference , argued this had led to support for extremism .
he also warned against downplaying britain 's christian heritage .
mr grieve told the guardian : " we 've actually done something terrible to ourselves in britain .
" in the name of trying to prepare people for some new multicultural society we 've encouraged people , particularly the sort of long-term inhabitants , to say ' well your cultural background is n't really very important ' . "
' huge damage ' the vacuum created by multiculturalism has encouraged support for extremists on both sides , he argues .
the shadow home secretary went on to say multiculturalism was inspired by the " understandable " desire to make people feel comfortable .
but he added : " the idea behind it was -lsb- to -rsb- create the melting pot .
but the melting pot needs the ingredients of people 's confidence in themselves as they come together .
and if it is n't there i think we 've done ourselves huge damage . "
mr grieve also said the part played by christianity in britain should not be ignored .
" the role of christianity is really rather important .
it ca n't just be magicked out of the script .
it colours many of the fundamental viewpoints of british people , including many who 've never been in a church . "
' outdated ' policy it is not the first time a tory home secretary has spoken out against multiculturalism .
in 2005 , the then shadow home secretary david davis called on the government to scrap the " outdated " policy , saying that allowing people of different cultures to settle without integrating let the " perverted values of suicide bombers " take root .
mr davis said he agreed with trevor phillips , the chairman of the then commission for racial equality , who a year earlier argued multiculturalism belonged to a different era .
mr phillips said all citizens should " assert a core of britishness " .
conference start asked about mr grieve 's comments on bbc one 's andrew marr show , conservative leader david cameron said he agreed that " state multiculturalism " had been the wrong approach .
mr cameron said : " what he said was that state multiculturalism - the idea that as welcoming people into our country and keep them all in silos , and treat british muslims as muslims , rather than as british citizens , treat british jews as jews rather than as british citizens - that is wrong .
" i think trying to integrate more , trying to bring people together more , trying to build a strong british identity for the future , i think that 's absolutely right . "
mr grieve 's comments come as an icm poll for the guardian suggested labour had narrowed the gap on the tories .
the poll put the conservatives on 41 % , labour on 32 % and the lib dems on 18 % .
a comres survey for the independent on sunday last weekend put the tories on 39 % , labour on 27 % and the lib dems on 21 % .
the tory conference will open on sunday in birmingham , with a discussion on the economy involving shadow chancellor george osborne and shadow foreign secretary william hague .
leader david cameron 's speech closes the conference on wednesday .
