" this is a historic contribution for the future of europe and the future of the mediterranean , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso after the formal launch of the union for the mediterranean . " a major initiative is born , and now we have to nurture it and go further , " added the meeting 's host , french president nicolas sarkozy .
he urged the mediterranean states to emulate europe 's model of reconciliation and cooperation . " everyone will have to make an effort , as the europeans did , to put an end to the deadly spiral of war and violence , that , century after century , repeatedly brought barbarity to the heart of civilization , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy called the launch a " dream come true " leaders of the eu and of its southern neighbors agreed sunday to a joint declaration accompanying the creation of the union , a breakthrough which came after heads of state and government from 43 countries , among them israel , syria and the palestinian territories , overcame their differences over a reference to the middle east peace process . unlike its draft version , the final declaration approved in paris made explicit references to the annapolis peace conference and to a meeting of eu and mediterranean foreign ministers in lisbon last year . the leaders further " recall that peace in the middle east requires a comprehensive solution and in this regard welcome the announcement that syria and israel have initiated indirect peace talks under the auspices of turkey . " israeli prime minister ehud olmert , syrian president bashar al-assad and the president of the palestinian authority , mahmoud abbas , were among the leaders attending the summit , which was held in the glass-roofed halls of paris ' grand palais , by the champs elysees . calls for peace among old foes sarkozy had earlier opened the founding summit meeting of the union for the mediterranean with an appeal for peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy called the launch a " dream come true " " the nations along the mediterranean , and those who are not , share a common interest : that peace and stability reign on the mediterranean , " sarkozy told heads of state and government from the european union and from countries along the mediterranean basin . " the success and failure of everything we undertake with each other will depend first and foremost on the ability of each and every one of us to truly share , " sarkozy said .
" this means building increasingly close solidarity , with respect for one another . " egyptian president hosni mubarak , who will co-chair the union with sarkozy during its initial phase , said the eu should help promote growth in the mediterranean or face a massive influx of immigrants in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel demanded action , not just words from syria " what will be the situation in the mediterranean , in particular on the southern shores , in 2030 or 2050 ?
and what consequences will that have on our partners on the northern shores ? " he said , noting that the area 's population was projected to grow from the current 272 million to 332 million in 2020 . the draft joint declaration being discussed in paris contained sensitive passages on the need to prevent religion from being associated with terrorism , and calls for a nuclear-free middle east . israel is the only middle eastern country which is widely believed to have a nuclear arsenal . revamping ' barcelona ' tough negotiations also took place on the exact scope and power structure of the union , which sarkozy devised as a means of revamping the eu 's 13-year-old southern neighborhood policy , which is known as the barcelona process . the eu 's executive , the european commission , says it has already spent some 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- on barcelona between 1995 and 2007 , and plans to invest a further 9 billion euros over the next six years . but officials in brussels concede that it has failed to deliver .
the new union hopes to attract private investors by focusing on concrete projects . among them are plans for " motorways of the sea , " a belt of solar power plants , a programme to help cope with natural disasters , and the creation of an agency to promote medium-sized businesses . it also gives the south a stronger voice through a co-chairmanship .
its first presidents are france , as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and egypt . ahead of the launch in paris , sarkozy held joint talks with olmert and abbas , who spoke of their hopes of moving closer to peace .

" this is a historic contribution for the future of europe and the future of the mediterranean , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso after the formal launch of the union for the mediterranean . " a major initiative is born , and now we have to nurture it and go further , " added the meeting 's host , french president nicolas sarkozy .
he urged the mediterranean states to emulate europe 's model of reconciliation and cooperation . " everyone will have to make an effort , as the europeans did , to put an end to the deadly spiral of war and violence , that , century after century , repeatedly brought barbarity to the heart of civilization , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy called the launch a " dream come true " leaders of the eu and of its southern neighbors agreed sunday to a joint declaration accompanying the creation of the union , a breakthrough which came after heads of state and government from 43 countries , among them israel , syria and the palestinian territories , overcame their differences over a reference to the middle east peace process . unlike its draft version , the final declaration approved in paris made explicit references to the annapolis peace conference and to a meeting of eu and mediterranean foreign ministers in lisbon last year . the leaders further " recall that peace in the middle east requires a comprehensive solution and in this regard welcome the announcement that syria and israel have initiated indirect peace talks under the auspices of turkey . " israeli prime minister ehud olmert , syrian president bashar al-assad and the president of the palestinian authority , mahmoud abbas , were among the leaders attending the summit , which was held in the glass-roofed halls of paris ' grand palais , by the champs elysees . calls for peace among old foes sarkozy had earlier opened the founding summit meeting of the union for the mediterranean with an appeal for peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy called the launch a " dream come true " " the nations along the mediterranean , and those who are not , share a common interest : that peace and stability reign on the mediterranean , " sarkozy told heads of state and government from the european union and from countries along the mediterranean basin . " the success and failure of everything we undertake with each other will depend first and foremost on the ability of each and every one of us to truly share , " sarkozy said .
" this means building increasingly close solidarity , with respect for one another . " egyptian president hosni mubarak , who will co-chair the union with sarkozy during its initial phase , said the eu should help promote growth in the mediterranean or face a massive influx of immigrants in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel demanded action , not just words from syria " what will be the situation in the mediterranean , in particular on the southern shores , in 2030 or 2050 ?
and what consequences will that have on our partners on the northern shores ? " he said , noting that the area 's population was projected to grow from the current 272 million to 332 million in 2020 . the draft joint declaration being discussed in paris contained sensitive passages on the need to prevent religion from being associated with terrorism , and calls for a nuclear-free middle east . israel is the only middle eastern country which is widely believed to have a nuclear arsenal . revamping ' barcelona ' tough negotiations also took place on the exact scope and power structure of the union , which sarkozy devised as a means of revamping the eu 's 13-year-old southern neighborhood policy , which is known as the barcelona process . the eu 's executive , the european commission , says it has already spent some 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- on barcelona between 1995 and 2007 , and plans to invest a further 9 billion euros over the next six years . but officials in brussels concede that it has failed to deliver .
the new union hopes to attract private investors by focusing on concrete projects . among them are plans for " motorways of the sea , " a belt of solar power plants , a programme to help cope with natural disasters , and the creation of an agency to promote medium-sized businesses . it also gives the south a stronger voice through a co-chairmanship .
its first presidents are france , as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and egypt . ahead of the launch in paris , sarkozy held joint talks with olmert and abbas , who spoke of their hopes of moving closer to peace . " we have never been so close to an agreement than today , " olmert said of the middle east peace process . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2004 , the 41-year-old reportedly set up a foundation called " continent europe foundation " which counts the upper echelons of europe 's far-right scene among its members , according to der spiegel .
former teacher andreas molau , a member of the npd 's national executive , is also a member of the foundation 's directorate .
brinkmann is also believed to be behind a further real estate purchase in germany , according to the spiegel .
andreas molau 's wife bought a sizeable manor in rauen , a town in the eastern german state of brandenburg , for € 200,000 in may 2007 .
the property appeared to have been bought to house an npd training center .
but there has been considerable opposition to the alleged plans . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while some deride her , others say she 's on to something . the defense of women 's rights is undoubtedly a praiseworthy government policy , but just how far should it go ? the question is under debate in spain , where the country 's first equality ministry has launched initiatives that have earned 31-year-old bibiana aido - the youngest minister in spanish history - more sneers than cheers so far . not only did aido announce a telephone hotline to help men adapt to a " new model of masculinity " and wife batterers to " channel their aggressivity " before resorting to violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aido 's ideas are met with a lot of resistance she went as far as tackling the structures of the spanish language , proposing that the masculine-gendered word " miembro " -lrb- member -rrb- be given a feminine equivalent , " miembra . " academic guardians of the spanish language accused aido of not even knowing grammar , but prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero stood by his minister . " all fields are appropriate for waging the battle in favor of equality , " said zapatero , who wants his socialist government to play a ground-breaking role in promoting women 's rights worldwide . global vanguard ? during his first term as prime minister , zapatero pushed through reforms including electoral parity , measures towards increasing female representation on company boards of directors , and strong legislation against domestic violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's defense minister carme chacon gave birth to a son in may after winning a second term in march , zapatero went even further , appointing spain 's first female-dominated cabinet and irritating conservative army officers by giving the defense portfolio to carme chacon , who was in her seventh month of pregnancy at the time . the appointment of young aido to head an equality ministry with a small budget and unclear profile raised even more eyebrows . a " telephone for men " initially planned for wife batterers will also help other men " solve their doubts , because many of them feel lost " as the " patriarchal system " begins to crumble , aido explained . men will be able to call the hotline to discuss issues such as relationships , divorce , and fatherhood . ridiculous ideas ? some feminist groups welcomed the " good initiative , " while the conservative opposition people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- lambasted the idea that violent men could be dissuaded by a telephone line as " almost ridiculous . " aido elicited even more sneers and jokes and when addressing a parliamentary commission with the words " miembros y miembras . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least their team 's euro 2008 win gave spanish men something to cheer about masculine-gendered " miembro " refers to members of a group , men or women , while the feminine-sounding word " miembra " does not exist - at least not yet . renowned authors slammed " miembra " as a " stupidity " and as an example of " savage feminism , " but feminist linguists sympathized with aido 's attempts to wage the battle of equality on the deepest level - that of language . the spanish language was forged over millennia of male domination over women , the daily el pais pointed out .
the word " hombre " -lrb- man -rrb- can be used as a synonym for " human being , " to mention just one among countless examples . the advance of " a " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's future queen , letizia , worked as a tv news anchor before becoming royal as women have increasingly entered the workforce , language has become slightly more equalitarian , with words such as " ministra " -lrb- female minister -rrb- , " abogada " -lrb- female lawyer -rrb- or " jefa " -lrb- female boss -rrb- now forming part of everyday speech . a police officer is no longer just " un agente de policia " -lrb- word of masculine gender -rrb- , but also " una agente de policia " -lrb- feminine -rrb- .
a soldier can be " un " or " una soldado . " language could not be transformed through government orders , but it would spontaneously change to reflect new realities , commentators said . " language is created every day , and some words triumph , while others do not , " philologist pilar careaga said . undeterred by her critics , aido has now launched a new campaign against domestic violence with the idea that real men are not violent . and despite the pp 's contempt for the activities of the equality ministry , party leader mariano rajoy recently appointed young women to top party posts , conscious that female votes contributed to zapatero 's election victory . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i do n't want the venue to be a distraction . " germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper said obama 's advisors had promised the chancellor he would not speak at the brandenburg gate . while welcoming the visit , merkel expressed reservations at the notion that obama could use the backdrop of the historic setting to promote his bid to become the next president of the united states . she was joined in this view on sunday by conservative christian social union politician erwin huber , who said obama should not be granted the privilege to speak there because he had played no rule in german unification . historic site the brandenburg gate has strong historical overtones .
it was the symbol of german division when the berlin wall cut across it and later of unification after the wall fell in 1989 . former presidents ronald reagan and bill clinton made key speeches there while in office .
in 1987 reagan urged the soviet union 's last communist leader mikhail gorbachev to tear down the wall . but not everyone is opposed to obama speaking there .
merkel 's deputy , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , had no difficulty with the idea , his spokesman said .

" it 's historic progress that syria intends to have a diplomatic representation in lebanon and that lebanon plans to have a diplomatic representation in syria .
it 's never happened before , " said french president nicolas sarkozy , who presided over the first face-to-face talks between the new lebanese president , michel suleiman , and syria 's bashar al-assad . the meeting in paris was also attended by sheikh hamad bin khalifa al-thani , the qatar emir who had helped broker a peace deal in lebanon . it took place a day before leaders of the european union and its southern neighbours were due to meet for the formal launch of a union for the mediterranean , a project conceived by sarkozy to strengthen ties between the eu and its southern neighbors . mediator role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles all round at a press conference after the meetings during the talks in paris , assad asked france to assume , together with the united states , the role of mediator in future direct talks between israel and syria , adding however that the time for such talks was " not yet ripe . " sarkozy accepted an invitation to visit syria in early september and vowed to help secure closer ties between the eu and syria in his capacity as current holder of the bloc 's rotating presidency . in a joint french-syrian statement held after the talks , sarkozy " commended the strong determination of the syrian president to establish diplomatic relations with lebanon . " syria held a strong military presence in its smaller neighbor for decades , but finally pulled out its troops in 2005 . saturday 's meeting took place a day after the formation of a unity government in lebanon .
this followed an agreement in may between lebanon 's pro-western and syrian-backed factions to end the country 's worst political crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war . suleiman arrived first at the elysee palace , where he met with sarkozy before sitting down with assad and the emir of qatar . diplomatic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy hopes to focus more eu attention on the troubled middle east saturday 's meeting was seen as a diplomatic victory for sarkozy , who is keen to push the middle east high up the eu 's agenda . earlier saturday , the french president also held talks over lunch with egyptian president hosni mubarak , who will serve as co-chairman of the mediterranean union with sarkozy . israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas are also due to attend sunday 's launch of the union , which it is hoped will link more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean basin and the eu 's 27 member states . the project was initially resisted by turkey , which had feared that it was meant to serve as an alternative to eu membership .
but turkish foreign minister ali babacan endorsed it on saturday , saying it would promote " peace , stability and development in the region . " during his talks with assad , sarkozy also said he would work to sign a long-awaited association agreement between the eu and syria .
discussions on the text ended in 2004 , but there has been little progress since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , lebanon boycotted a summit in syria the eu has already signed association agreements with , among others , jordan and israel .
such agreements envisage trade deals and eu technical assistance in return for reforms on human rights . " we talked about human rights .
and i encouraged assad to make supplementary steps in this respect , " sarkozy said saturday . asked about his role in helping diplomacy move forward in the middle east , sarkozy said : " france wants to be a messenger of peace .

" it 's historic progress that syria intends to have a diplomatic representation in lebanon and that lebanon plans to have a diplomatic representation in syria .
it 's never happened before , " said french president nicolas sarkozy , who presided over the first face-to-face talks between the new lebanese president , michel suleiman , and syria 's bashar al-assad . the meeting in paris was also attended by sheikh hamad bin khalifa al-thani , the qatar emir who had helped broker a peace deal in lebanon . it took place a day before leaders of the european union and its southern neighbours were due to meet for the formal launch of a union for the mediterranean , a project conceived by sarkozy to strengthen ties between the eu and its southern neighbors . mediator role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles all round at a press conference after the meetings during the talks in paris , assad asked france to assume , together with the united states , the role of mediator in future direct talks between israel and syria , adding however that the time for such talks was " not yet ripe . " sarkozy accepted an invitation to visit syria in early september and vowed to help secure closer ties between the eu and syria in his capacity as current holder of the bloc 's rotating presidency . in a joint french-syrian statement held after the talks , sarkozy " commended the strong determination of the syrian president to establish diplomatic relations with lebanon . " syria held a strong military presence in its smaller neighbor for decades , but finally pulled out its troops in 2005 . saturday 's meeting took place a day after the formation of a unity government in lebanon .
this followed an agreement in may between lebanon 's pro-western and syrian-backed factions to end the country 's worst political crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war . suleiman arrived first at the elysee palace , where he met with sarkozy before sitting down with assad and the emir of qatar . diplomatic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy hopes to focus more eu attention on the troubled middle east saturday 's meeting was seen as a diplomatic victory for sarkozy , who is keen to push the middle east high up the eu 's agenda . earlier saturday , the french president also held talks over lunch with egyptian president hosni mubarak , who will serve as co-chairman of the mediterranean union with sarkozy . israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas are also due to attend sunday 's launch of the union , which it is hoped will link more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean basin and the eu 's 27 member states . the project was initially resisted by turkey , which had feared that it was meant to serve as an alternative to eu membership .
but turkish foreign minister ali babacan endorsed it on saturday , saying it would promote " peace , stability and development in the region . " during his talks with assad , sarkozy also said he would work to sign a long-awaited association agreement between the eu and syria .
discussions on the text ended in 2004 , but there has been little progress since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , lebanon boycotted a summit in syria the eu has already signed association agreements with , among others , jordan and israel .
such agreements envisage trade deals and eu technical assistance in return for reforms on human rights . " we talked about human rights .
and i encouraged assad to make supplementary steps in this respect , " sarkozy said saturday . asked about his role in helping diplomacy move forward in the middle east , sarkozy said : " france wants to be a messenger of peace .
and to be a messenger of peace you have to talk with everyone . " dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brinkmann is reportedly a leading figure in the international far-right scene with close contacts to germany 's far-right npd party .

former teacher andreas molau , a member of the npd 's national executive , is also a member of the foundation 's directorate .
brinkmann is also believed to be behind a further real estate purchase in germany , according to the spiegel .

" i do n't want the venue to be a distraction . " germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper said obama 's advisors had promised the chancellor he would not speak at the brandenburg gate . while welcoming the visit , merkel expressed reservations at the notion that obama could use the backdrop of the historic setting to promote his bid to become the next president of the united states . she was joined in this view on sunday by conservative christian social union politician erwin huber , who said obama should not be granted the privilege to speak there because he had played no rule in german unification . historic site the brandenburg gate has strong historical overtones .
it was the symbol of german division when the berlin wall cut across it and later of unification after the wall fell in 1989 . former presidents ronald reagan and bill clinton made key speeches there while in office .
in 1987 reagan urged the soviet union 's last communist leader mikhail gorbachev to tear down the wall . but not everyone is opposed to obama speaking there .
merkel 's deputy , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , had no difficulty with the idea , his spokesman said .

" it 's historic progress that syria intends to have a diplomatic representation in lebanon and that lebanon plans to have a diplomatic representation in syria .
it 's never happened before , " said french president nicolas sarkozy , who presided over the first face-to-face talks between the new lebanese president , michel suleiman , and syria 's bashar al-assad . the meeting in paris was also attended by sheikh hamad bin khalifa al-thani , the qatar emir who had helped broker a peace deal in lebanon . it took place a day before leaders of the european union and its southern neighbours were due to meet for the formal launch of a union for the mediterranean , a project conceived by sarkozy to strengthen ties between the eu and its southern neighbors . mediator role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles all round at a press conference after the meetings during the talks in paris , assad asked france to assume , together with the united states , the role of mediator in future direct talks between israel and syria , adding however that the time for such talks was " not yet ripe . " sarkozy accepted an invitation to visit syria in early september and vowed to help secure closer ties between the eu and syria in his capacity as current holder of the bloc 's rotating presidency . in a joint french-syrian statement held after the talks , sarkozy " commended the strong determination of the syrian president to establish diplomatic relations with lebanon . " syria held a strong military presence in its smaller neighbor for decades , but finally pulled out its troops in 2005 . saturday 's meeting took place a day after the formation of a unity government in lebanon .
this followed an agreement in may between lebanon 's pro-western and syrian-backed factions to end the country 's worst political crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war . suleiman arrived first at the elysee palace , where he met with sarkozy before sitting down with assad and the emir of qatar . diplomatic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy hopes to focus more eu attention on the troubled middle east saturday 's meeting was seen as a diplomatic victory for sarkozy , who is keen to push the middle east high up the eu 's agenda . earlier saturday , the french president also held talks over lunch with egyptian president hosni mubarak , who will serve as co-chairman of the mediterranean union with sarkozy . israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas are also due to attend sunday 's launch of the union , which it is hoped will link more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean basin and the eu 's 27 member states . the project was initially resisted by turkey , which had feared that it was meant to serve as an alternative to eu membership .
but turkish foreign minister ali babacan endorsed it on saturday , saying it would promote " peace , stability and development in the region . " during his talks with assad , sarkozy also said he would work to sign a long-awaited association agreement between the eu and syria .
discussions on the text ended in 2004 , but there has been little progress since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , lebanon boycotted a summit in syria the eu has already signed association agreements with , among others , jordan and israel .
such agreements envisage trade deals and eu technical assistance in return for reforms on human rights . " we talked about human rights .
and i encouraged assad to make supplementary steps in this respect , " sarkozy said saturday . asked about his role in helping diplomacy move forward in the middle east , sarkozy said : " france wants to be a messenger of peace .

while some deride her , others say she 's on to something . the defense of women 's rights is undoubtedly a praiseworthy government policy , but just how far should it go ? the question is under debate in spain , where the country 's first equality ministry has launched initiatives that have earned 31-year-old bibiana aido - the youngest minister in spanish history - more sneers than cheers so far . not only did aido announce a telephone hotline to help men adapt to a " new model of masculinity " and wife batterers to " channel their aggressivity " before resorting to violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aido 's ideas are met with a lot of resistance she went as far as tackling the structures of the spanish language , proposing that the masculine-gendered word " miembro " -lrb- member -rrb- be given a feminine equivalent , " miembra . " academic guardians of the spanish language accused aido of not even knowing grammar , but prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero stood by his minister . " all fields are appropriate for waging the battle in favor of equality , " said zapatero , who wants his socialist government to play a ground-breaking role in promoting women 's rights worldwide . global vanguard ? during his first term as prime minister , zapatero pushed through reforms including electoral parity , measures towards increasing female representation on company boards of directors , and strong legislation against domestic violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's defense minister carme chacon gave birth to a son in may after winning a second term in march , zapatero went even further , appointing spain 's first female-dominated cabinet and irritating conservative army officers by giving the defense portfolio to carme chacon , who was in her seventh month of pregnancy at the time . the appointment of young aido to head an equality ministry with a small budget and unclear profile raised even more eyebrows . a " telephone for men " initially planned for wife batterers will also help other men " solve their doubts , because many of them feel lost " as the " patriarchal system " begins to crumble , aido explained . men will be able to call the hotline to discuss issues such as relationships , divorce , and fatherhood . ridiculous ideas ? some feminist groups welcomed the " good initiative , " while the conservative opposition people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- lambasted the idea that violent men could be dissuaded by a telephone line as " almost ridiculous . " aido elicited even more sneers and jokes and when addressing a parliamentary commission with the words " miembros y miembras . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least their team 's euro 2008 win gave spanish men something to cheer about masculine-gendered " miembro " refers to members of a group , men or women , while the feminine-sounding word " miembra " does not exist - at least not yet . renowned authors slammed " miembra " as a " stupidity " and as an example of " savage feminism , " but feminist linguists sympathized with aido 's attempts to wage the battle of equality on the deepest level - that of language . the spanish language was forged over millennia of male domination over women , the daily el pais pointed out .
the word " hombre " -lrb- man -rrb- can be used as a synonym for " human being , " to mention just one among countless examples . the advance of " a " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's future queen , letizia , worked as a tv news anchor before becoming royal as women have increasingly entered the workforce , language has become slightly more equalitarian , with words such as " ministra " -lrb- female minister -rrb- , " abogada " -lrb- female lawyer -rrb- or " jefa " -lrb- female boss -rrb- now forming part of everyday speech . a police officer is no longer just " un agente de policia " -lrb- word of masculine gender -rrb- , but also " una agente de policia " -lrb- feminine -rrb- .
a soldier can be " un " or " una soldado . " language could not be transformed through government orders , but it would spontaneously change to reflect new realities , commentators said . " language is created every day , and some words triumph , while others do not , " philologist pilar careaga said . undeterred by her critics , aido has now launched a new campaign against domestic violence with the idea that real men are not violent . and despite the pp 's contempt for the activities of the equality ministry , party leader mariano rajoy recently appointed young women to top party posts , conscious that female votes contributed to zapatero 's election victory . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama does n't want the venue to be a distraction " our goal is for me to lay out how i think about the next administration 's role in rebuilding a trans-atlantic alliance , " he was quoted as saying by the new york times on sunday .
" i do n't want the venue to be a distraction . " germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper said obama 's advisors had promised the chancellor he would not speak at the brandenburg gate . while welcoming the visit , merkel expressed reservations at the notion that obama could use the backdrop of the historic setting to promote his bid to become the next president of the united states . she was joined in this view on sunday by conservative christian social union politician erwin huber , who said obama should not be granted the privilege to speak there because he had played no rule in german unification . historic site the brandenburg gate has strong historical overtones .
it was the symbol of german division when the berlin wall cut across it and later of unification after the wall fell in 1989 . former presidents ronald reagan and bill clinton made key speeches there while in office .
in 1987 reagan urged the soviet union 's last communist leader mikhail gorbachev to tear down the wall . but not everyone is opposed to obama speaking there .
merkel 's deputy , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , had no difficulty with the idea , his spokesman said .

brinkmann is reportedly a leading figure in the international far-right scene with close contacts to germany 's far-right npd party .
in 2004 , the 41-year-old reportedly set up a foundation called " continent europe foundation " which counts the upper echelons of europe 's far-right scene among its members , according to der spiegel .
former teacher andreas molau , a member of the npd 's national executive , is also a member of the foundation 's directorate .
brinkmann is also believed to be behind a further real estate purchase in germany , according to the spiegel .
andreas molau 's wife bought a sizeable manor in rauen , a town in the eastern german state of brandenburg , for € 200,000 in may 2007 .
the property appeared to have been bought to house an npd training center .

" it 's historic progress that syria intends to have a diplomatic representation in lebanon and that lebanon plans to have a diplomatic representation in syria .
it 's never happened before , " said french president nicolas sarkozy , who presided over the first face-to-face talks between the new lebanese president , michel suleiman , and syria 's bashar al-assad . the meeting in paris was also attended by sheikh hamad bin khalifa al-thani , the qatar emir who had helped broker a peace deal in lebanon . it took place a day before leaders of the european union and its southern neighbours were due to meet for the formal launch of a union for the mediterranean , a project conceived by sarkozy to strengthen ties between the eu and its southern neighbors . mediator role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles all round at a press conference after the meetings during the talks in paris , assad asked france to assume , together with the united states , the role of mediator in future direct talks between israel and syria , adding however that the time for such talks was " not yet ripe . " sarkozy accepted an invitation to visit syria in early september and vowed to help secure closer ties between the eu and syria in his capacity as current holder of the bloc 's rotating presidency . in a joint french-syrian statement held after the talks , sarkozy " commended the strong determination of the syrian president to establish diplomatic relations with lebanon . " syria held a strong military presence in its smaller neighbor for decades , but finally pulled out its troops in 2005 . saturday 's meeting took place a day after the formation of a unity government in lebanon .
this followed an agreement in may between lebanon 's pro-western and syrian-backed factions to end the country 's worst political crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war . suleiman arrived first at the elysee palace , where he met with sarkozy before sitting down with assad and the emir of qatar . diplomatic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy hopes to focus more eu attention on the troubled middle east saturday 's meeting was seen as a diplomatic victory for sarkozy , who is keen to push the middle east high up the eu 's agenda . earlier saturday , the french president also held talks over lunch with egyptian president hosni mubarak , who will serve as co-chairman of the mediterranean union with sarkozy . israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas are also due to attend sunday 's launch of the union , which it is hoped will link more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean basin and the eu 's 27 member states . the project was initially resisted by turkey , which had feared that it was meant to serve as an alternative to eu membership .
but turkish foreign minister ali babacan endorsed it on saturday , saying it would promote " peace , stability and development in the region . " during his talks with assad , sarkozy also said he would work to sign a long-awaited association agreement between the eu and syria .
discussions on the text ended in 2004 , but there has been little progress since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , lebanon boycotted a summit in syria the eu has already signed association agreements with , among others , jordan and israel .
such agreements envisage trade deals and eu technical assistance in return for reforms on human rights . " we talked about human rights .

brinkmann is reportedly a leading figure in the international far-right scene with close contacts to germany 's far-right npd party .

" it 's historic progress that syria intends to have a diplomatic representation in lebanon and that lebanon plans to have a diplomatic representation in syria .
it 's never happened before , " said french president nicolas sarkozy , who presided over the first face-to-face talks between the new lebanese president , michel suleiman , and syria 's bashar al-assad . the meeting in paris was also attended by sheikh hamad bin khalifa al-thani , the qatar emir who had helped broker a peace deal in lebanon . it took place a day before leaders of the european union and its southern neighbours were due to meet for the formal launch of a union for the mediterranean , a project conceived by sarkozy to strengthen ties between the eu and its southern neighbors . mediator role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles all round at a press conference after the meetings during the talks in paris , assad asked france to assume , together with the united states , the role of mediator in future direct talks between israel and syria , adding however that the time for such talks was " not yet ripe . " sarkozy accepted an invitation to visit syria in early september and vowed to help secure closer ties between the eu and syria in his capacity as current holder of the bloc 's rotating presidency . in a joint french-syrian statement held after the talks , sarkozy " commended the strong determination of the syrian president to establish diplomatic relations with lebanon . " syria held a strong military presence in its smaller neighbor for decades , but finally pulled out its troops in 2005 . saturday 's meeting took place a day after the formation of a unity government in lebanon .
this followed an agreement in may between lebanon 's pro-western and syrian-backed factions to end the country 's worst political crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war . suleiman arrived first at the elysee palace , where he met with sarkozy before sitting down with assad and the emir of qatar . diplomatic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy hopes to focus more eu attention on the troubled middle east saturday 's meeting was seen as a diplomatic victory for sarkozy , who is keen to push the middle east high up the eu 's agenda . earlier saturday , the french president also held talks over lunch with egyptian president hosni mubarak , who will serve as co-chairman of the mediterranean union with sarkozy . israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas are also due to attend sunday 's launch of the union , which it is hoped will link more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean basin and the eu 's 27 member states . the project was initially resisted by turkey , which had feared that it was meant to serve as an alternative to eu membership .
but turkish foreign minister ali babacan endorsed it on saturday , saying it would promote " peace , stability and development in the region . " during his talks with assad , sarkozy also said he would work to sign a long-awaited association agreement between the eu and syria .
discussions on the text ended in 2004 , but there has been little progress since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , lebanon boycotted a summit in syria the eu has already signed association agreements with , among others , jordan and israel .
such agreements envisage trade deals and eu technical assistance in return for reforms on human rights . " we talked about human rights .
and i encouraged assad to make supplementary steps in this respect , " sarkozy said saturday . asked about his role in helping diplomacy move forward in the middle east , sarkozy said : " france wants to be a messenger of peace .
and to be a messenger of peace you have to talk with everyone . " dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is a historic contribution for the future of europe and the future of the mediterranean , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso after the formal launch of the union for the mediterranean . " a major initiative is born , and now we have to nurture it and go further , " added the meeting 's host , french president nicolas sarkozy .
he urged the mediterranean states to emulate europe 's model of reconciliation and cooperation . " everyone will have to make an effort , as the europeans did , to put an end to the deadly spiral of war and violence , that , century after century , repeatedly brought barbarity to the heart of civilization , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy called the launch a " dream come true " leaders of the eu and of its southern neighbors agreed sunday to a joint declaration accompanying the creation of the union , a breakthrough which came after heads of state and government from 43 countries , among them israel , syria and the palestinian territories , overcame their differences over a reference to the middle east peace process . unlike its draft version , the final declaration approved in paris made explicit references to the annapolis peace conference and to a meeting of eu and mediterranean foreign ministers in lisbon last year . the leaders further " recall that peace in the middle east requires a comprehensive solution and in this regard welcome the announcement that syria and israel have initiated indirect peace talks under the auspices of turkey . " israeli prime minister ehud olmert , syrian president bashar al-assad and the president of the palestinian authority , mahmoud abbas , were among the leaders attending the summit , which was held in the glass-roofed halls of paris ' grand palais , by the champs elysees . calls for peace among old foes sarkozy had earlier opened the founding summit meeting of the union for the mediterranean with an appeal for peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy called the launch a " dream come true " " the nations along the mediterranean , and those who are not , share a common interest : that peace and stability reign on the mediterranean , " sarkozy told heads of state and government from the european union and from countries along the mediterranean basin . " the success and failure of everything we undertake with each other will depend first and foremost on the ability of each and every one of us to truly share , " sarkozy said .
" this means building increasingly close solidarity , with respect for one another . " egyptian president hosni mubarak , who will co-chair the union with sarkozy during its initial phase , said the eu should help promote growth in the mediterranean or face a massive influx of immigrants in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel demanded action , not just words from syria " what will be the situation in the mediterranean , in particular on the southern shores , in 2030 or 2050 ?
and what consequences will that have on our partners on the northern shores ? " he said , noting that the area 's population was projected to grow from the current 272 million to 332 million in 2020 . the draft joint declaration being discussed in paris contained sensitive passages on the need to prevent religion from being associated with terrorism , and calls for a nuclear-free middle east . israel is the only middle eastern country which is widely believed to have a nuclear arsenal . revamping ' barcelona ' tough negotiations also took place on the exact scope and power structure of the union , which sarkozy devised as a means of revamping the eu 's 13-year-old southern neighborhood policy , which is known as the barcelona process . the eu 's executive , the european commission , says it has already spent some 8 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- on barcelona between 1995 and 2007 , and plans to invest a further 9 billion euros over the next six years . but officials in brussels concede that it has failed to deliver .
the new union hopes to attract private investors by focusing on concrete projects . among them are plans for " motorways of the sea , " a belt of solar power plants , a programme to help cope with natural disasters , and the creation of an agency to promote medium-sized businesses . it also gives the south a stronger voice through a co-chairmanship .
its first presidents are france , as the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and egypt . ahead of the launch in paris , sarkozy held joint talks with olmert and abbas , who spoke of their hopes of moving closer to peace .

former teacher andreas molau , a member of the npd 's national executive , is also a member of the foundation 's directorate .
brinkmann is also believed to be behind a further real estate purchase in germany , according to the spiegel .

it 's never happened before , " said french president nicolas sarkozy , who presided over the first face-to-face talks between the new lebanese president , michel suleiman , and syria 's bashar al-assad . the meeting in paris was also attended by sheikh hamad bin khalifa al-thani , the qatar emir who had helped broker a peace deal in lebanon . it took place a day before leaders of the european union and its southern neighbours were due to meet for the formal launch of a union for the mediterranean , a project conceived by sarkozy to strengthen ties between the eu and its southern neighbors . mediator role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles all round at a press conference after the meetings during the talks in paris , assad asked france to assume , together with the united states , the role of mediator in future direct talks between israel and syria , adding however that the time for such talks was " not yet ripe . " sarkozy accepted an invitation to visit syria in early september and vowed to help secure closer ties between the eu and syria in his capacity as current holder of the bloc 's rotating presidency . in a joint french-syrian statement held after the talks , sarkozy " commended the strong determination of the syrian president to establish diplomatic relations with lebanon . " syria held a strong military presence in its smaller neighbor for decades , but finally pulled out its troops in 2005 . saturday 's meeting took place a day after the formation of a unity government in lebanon .
this followed an agreement in may between lebanon 's pro-western and syrian-backed factions to end the country 's worst political crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war . suleiman arrived first at the elysee palace , where he met with sarkozy before sitting down with assad and the emir of qatar . diplomatic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy hopes to focus more eu attention on the troubled middle east saturday 's meeting was seen as a diplomatic victory for sarkozy , who is keen to push the middle east high up the eu 's agenda . earlier saturday , the french president also held talks over lunch with egyptian president hosni mubarak , who will serve as co-chairman of the mediterranean union with sarkozy . israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas are also due to attend sunday 's launch of the union , which it is hoped will link more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean basin and the eu 's 27 member states . the project was initially resisted by turkey , which had feared that it was meant to serve as an alternative to eu membership .
but turkish foreign minister ali babacan endorsed it on saturday , saying it would promote " peace , stability and development in the region . " during his talks with assad , sarkozy also said he would work to sign a long-awaited association agreement between the eu and syria .
discussions on the text ended in 2004 , but there has been little progress since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , lebanon boycotted a summit in syria the eu has already signed association agreements with , among others , jordan and israel .
such agreements envisage trade deals and eu technical assistance in return for reforms on human rights . " we talked about human rights .
and i encouraged assad to make supplementary steps in this respect , " sarkozy said saturday . asked about his role in helping diplomacy move forward in the middle east , sarkozy said : " france wants to be a messenger of peace .
and to be a messenger of peace you have to talk with everyone . " dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all fields are appropriate for waging the battle in favor of equality , " said zapatero , who wants his socialist government to play a ground-breaking role in promoting women 's rights worldwide . global vanguard ? during his first term as prime minister , zapatero pushed through reforms including electoral parity , measures towards increasing female representation on company boards of directors , and strong legislation against domestic violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's defense minister carme chacon gave birth to a son in may after winning a second term in march , zapatero went even further , appointing spain 's first female-dominated cabinet and irritating conservative army officers by giving the defense portfolio to carme chacon , who was in her seventh month of pregnancy at the time . the appointment of young aido to head an equality ministry with a small budget and unclear profile raised even more eyebrows . a " telephone for men " initially planned for wife batterers will also help other men " solve their doubts , because many of them feel lost " as the " patriarchal system " begins to crumble , aido explained . men will be able to call the hotline to discuss issues such as relationships , divorce , and fatherhood . ridiculous ideas ? some feminist groups welcomed the " good initiative , " while the conservative opposition people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- lambasted the idea that violent men could be dissuaded by a telephone line as " almost ridiculous . " aido elicited even more sneers and jokes and when addressing a parliamentary commission with the words " miembros y miembras . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least their team 's euro 2008 win gave spanish men something to cheer about masculine-gendered " miembro " refers to members of a group , men or women , while the feminine-sounding word " miembra " does not exist - at least not yet . renowned authors slammed " miembra " as a " stupidity " and as an example of " savage feminism , " but feminist linguists sympathized with aido 's attempts to wage the battle of equality on the deepest level - that of language . the spanish language was forged over millennia of male domination over women , the daily el pais pointed out .
the word " hombre " -lrb- man -rrb- can be used as a synonym for " human being , " to mention just one among countless examples . the advance of " a " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's future queen , letizia , worked as a tv news anchor before becoming royal as women have increasingly entered the workforce , language has become slightly more equalitarian , with words such as " ministra " -lrb- female minister -rrb- , " abogada " -lrb- female lawyer -rrb- or " jefa " -lrb- female boss -rrb- now forming part of everyday speech . a police officer is no longer just " un agente de policia " -lrb- word of masculine gender -rrb- , but also " una agente de policia " -lrb- feminine -rrb- .
a soldier can be " un " or " una soldado . " language could not be transformed through government orders , but it would spontaneously change to reflect new realities , commentators said . " language is created every day , and some words triumph , while others do not , " philologist pilar careaga said . undeterred by her critics , aido has now launched a new campaign against domestic violence with the idea that real men are not violent . and despite the pp 's contempt for the activities of the equality ministry , party leader mariano rajoy recently appointed young women to top party posts , conscious that female votes contributed to zapatero 's election victory . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's historic progress that syria intends to have a diplomatic representation in lebanon and that lebanon plans to have a diplomatic representation in syria .
it 's never happened before , " said french president nicolas sarkozy , who presided over the first face-to-face talks between the new lebanese president , michel suleiman , and syria 's bashar al-assad . the meeting in paris was also attended by sheikh hamad bin khalifa al-thani , the qatar emir who had helped broker a peace deal in lebanon . it took place a day before leaders of the european union and its southern neighbours were due to meet for the formal launch of a union for the mediterranean , a project conceived by sarkozy to strengthen ties between the eu and its southern neighbors . mediator role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles all round at a press conference after the meetings during the talks in paris , assad asked france to assume , together with the united states , the role of mediator in future direct talks between israel and syria , adding however that the time for such talks was " not yet ripe . " sarkozy accepted an invitation to visit syria in early september and vowed to help secure closer ties between the eu and syria in his capacity as current holder of the bloc 's rotating presidency . in a joint french-syrian statement held after the talks , sarkozy " commended the strong determination of the syrian president to establish diplomatic relations with lebanon . " syria held a strong military presence in its smaller neighbor for decades , but finally pulled out its troops in 2005 . saturday 's meeting took place a day after the formation of a unity government in lebanon .
this followed an agreement in may between lebanon 's pro-western and syrian-backed factions to end the country 's worst political crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war . suleiman arrived first at the elysee palace , where he met with sarkozy before sitting down with assad and the emir of qatar . diplomatic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy hopes to focus more eu attention on the troubled middle east saturday 's meeting was seen as a diplomatic victory for sarkozy , who is keen to push the middle east high up the eu 's agenda . earlier saturday , the french president also held talks over lunch with egyptian president hosni mubarak , who will serve as co-chairman of the mediterranean union with sarkozy . israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas are also due to attend sunday 's launch of the union , which it is hoped will link more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean basin and the eu 's 27 member states . the project was initially resisted by turkey , which had feared that it was meant to serve as an alternative to eu membership .
but turkish foreign minister ali babacan endorsed it on saturday , saying it would promote " peace , stability and development in the region . " during his talks with assad , sarkozy also said he would work to sign a long-awaited association agreement between the eu and syria .
discussions on the text ended in 2004 , but there has been little progress since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , lebanon boycotted a summit in syria the eu has already signed association agreements with , among others , jordan and israel .
such agreements envisage trade deals and eu technical assistance in return for reforms on human rights . " we talked about human rights .
and i encouraged assad to make supplementary steps in this respect , " sarkozy said saturday . asked about his role in helping diplomacy move forward in the middle east , sarkozy said : " france wants to be a messenger of peace .
and to be a messenger of peace you have to talk with everyone . " dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while some deride her , others say she 's on to something . the defense of women 's rights is undoubtedly a praiseworthy government policy , but just how far should it go ? the question is under debate in spain , where the country 's first equality ministry has launched initiatives that have earned 31-year-old bibiana aido - the youngest minister in spanish history - more sneers than cheers so far . not only did aido announce a telephone hotline to help men adapt to a " new model of masculinity " and wife batterers to " channel their aggressivity " before resorting to violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aido 's ideas are met with a lot of resistance she went as far as tackling the structures of the spanish language , proposing that the masculine-gendered word " miembro " -lrb- member -rrb- be given a feminine equivalent , " miembra . " academic guardians of the spanish language accused aido of not even knowing grammar , but prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero stood by his minister . " all fields are appropriate for waging the battle in favor of equality , " said zapatero , who wants his socialist government to play a ground-breaking role in promoting women 's rights worldwide . global vanguard ? during his first term as prime minister , zapatero pushed through reforms including electoral parity , measures towards increasing female representation on company boards of directors , and strong legislation against domestic violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's defense minister carme chacon gave birth to a son in may after winning a second term in march , zapatero went even further , appointing spain 's first female-dominated cabinet and irritating conservative army officers by giving the defense portfolio to carme chacon , who was in her seventh month of pregnancy at the time . the appointment of young aido to head an equality ministry with a small budget and unclear profile raised even more eyebrows . a " telephone for men " initially planned for wife batterers will also help other men " solve their doubts , because many of them feel lost " as the " patriarchal system " begins to crumble , aido explained . men will be able to call the hotline to discuss issues such as relationships , divorce , and fatherhood . ridiculous ideas ? some feminist groups welcomed the " good initiative , " while the conservative opposition people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- lambasted the idea that violent men could be dissuaded by a telephone line as " almost ridiculous . " aido elicited even more sneers and jokes and when addressing a parliamentary commission with the words " miembros y miembras . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least their team 's euro 2008 win gave spanish men something to cheer about masculine-gendered " miembro " refers to members of a group , men or women , while the feminine-sounding word " miembra " does not exist - at least not yet . renowned authors slammed " miembra " as a " stupidity " and as an example of " savage feminism , " but feminist linguists sympathized with aido 's attempts to wage the battle of equality on the deepest level - that of language . the spanish language was forged over millennia of male domination over women , the daily el pais pointed out .
the word " hombre " -lrb- man -rrb- can be used as a synonym for " human being , " to mention just one among countless examples . the advance of " a " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's future queen , letizia , worked as a tv news anchor before becoming royal as women have increasingly entered the workforce , language has become slightly more equalitarian , with words such as " ministra " -lrb- female minister -rrb- , " abogada " -lrb- female lawyer -rrb- or " jefa " -lrb- female boss -rrb- now forming part of everyday speech . a police officer is no longer just " un agente de policia " -lrb- word of masculine gender -rrb- , but also " una agente de policia " -lrb- feminine -rrb- .
a soldier can be " un " or " una soldado . " language could not be transformed through government orders , but it would spontaneously change to reflect new realities , commentators said . " language is created every day , and some words triumph , while others do not , " philologist pilar careaga said . undeterred by her critics , aido has now launched a new campaign against domestic violence with the idea that real men are not violent . and despite the pp 's contempt for the activities of the equality ministry , party leader mariano rajoy recently appointed young women to top party posts , conscious that female votes contributed to zapatero 's election victory . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while some deride her , others say she 's on to something . the defense of women 's rights is undoubtedly a praiseworthy government policy , but just how far should it go ? the question is under debate in spain , where the country 's first equality ministry has launched initiatives that have earned 31-year-old bibiana aido - the youngest minister in spanish history - more sneers than cheers so far . not only did aido announce a telephone hotline to help men adapt to a " new model of masculinity " and wife batterers to " channel their aggressivity " before resorting to violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aido 's ideas are met with a lot of resistance she went as far as tackling the structures of the spanish language , proposing that the masculine-gendered word " miembro " -lrb- member -rrb- be given a feminine equivalent , " miembra . " academic guardians of the spanish language accused aido of not even knowing grammar , but prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero stood by his minister . " all fields are appropriate for waging the battle in favor of equality , " said zapatero , who wants his socialist government to play a ground-breaking role in promoting women 's rights worldwide . global vanguard ? during his first term as prime minister , zapatero pushed through reforms including electoral parity , measures towards increasing female representation on company boards of directors , and strong legislation against domestic violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's defense minister carme chacon gave birth to a son in may after winning a second term in march , zapatero went even further , appointing spain 's first female-dominated cabinet and irritating conservative army officers by giving the defense portfolio to carme chacon , who was in her seventh month of pregnancy at the time . the appointment of young aido to head an equality ministry with a small budget and unclear profile raised even more eyebrows . a " telephone for men " initially planned for wife batterers will also help other men " solve their doubts , because many of them feel lost " as the " patriarchal system " begins to crumble , aido explained . men will be able to call the hotline to discuss issues such as relationships , divorce , and fatherhood . ridiculous ideas ? some feminist groups welcomed the " good initiative , " while the conservative opposition people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- lambasted the idea that violent men could be dissuaded by a telephone line as " almost ridiculous . " aido elicited even more sneers and jokes and when addressing a parliamentary commission with the words " miembros y miembras . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least their team 's euro 2008 win gave spanish men something to cheer about masculine-gendered " miembro " refers to members of a group , men or women , while the feminine-sounding word " miembra " does not exist - at least not yet . renowned authors slammed " miembra " as a " stupidity " and as an example of " savage feminism , " but feminist linguists sympathized with aido 's attempts to wage the battle of equality on the deepest level - that of language . the spanish language was forged over millennia of male domination over women , the daily el pais pointed out .

while some deride her , others say she 's on to something . the defense of women 's rights is undoubtedly a praiseworthy government policy , but just how far should it go ? the question is under debate in spain , where the country 's first equality ministry has launched initiatives that have earned 31-year-old bibiana aido - the youngest minister in spanish history - more sneers than cheers so far . not only did aido announce a telephone hotline to help men adapt to a " new model of masculinity " and wife batterers to " channel their aggressivity " before resorting to violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aido 's ideas are met with a lot of resistance she went as far as tackling the structures of the spanish language , proposing that the masculine-gendered word " miembro " -lrb- member -rrb- be given a feminine equivalent , " miembra . " academic guardians of the spanish language accused aido of not even knowing grammar , but prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero stood by his minister . " all fields are appropriate for waging the battle in favor of equality , " said zapatero , who wants his socialist government to play a ground-breaking role in promoting women 's rights worldwide . global vanguard ? during his first term as prime minister , zapatero pushed through reforms including electoral parity , measures towards increasing female representation on company boards of directors , and strong legislation against domestic violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's defense minister carme chacon gave birth to a son in may after winning a second term in march , zapatero went even further , appointing spain 's first female-dominated cabinet and irritating conservative army officers by giving the defense portfolio to carme chacon , who was in her seventh month of pregnancy at the time . the appointment of young aido to head an equality ministry with a small budget and unclear profile raised even more eyebrows . a " telephone for men " initially planned for wife batterers will also help other men " solve their doubts , because many of them feel lost " as the " patriarchal system " begins to crumble , aido explained . men will be able to call the hotline to discuss issues such as relationships , divorce , and fatherhood . ridiculous ideas ? some feminist groups welcomed the " good initiative , " while the conservative opposition people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- lambasted the idea that violent men could be dissuaded by a telephone line as " almost ridiculous . " aido elicited even more sneers and jokes and when addressing a parliamentary commission with the words " miembros y miembras . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least their team 's euro 2008 win gave spanish men something to cheer about masculine-gendered " miembro " refers to members of a group , men or women , while the feminine-sounding word " miembra " does not exist - at least not yet . renowned authors slammed " miembra " as a " stupidity " and as an example of " savage feminism , " but feminist linguists sympathized with aido 's attempts to wage the battle of equality on the deepest level - that of language . the spanish language was forged over millennia of male domination over women , the daily el pais pointed out .
the word " hombre " -lrb- man -rrb- can be used as a synonym for " human being , " to mention just one among countless examples . the advance of " a " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's future queen , letizia , worked as a tv news anchor before becoming royal as women have increasingly entered the workforce , language has become slightly more equalitarian , with words such as " ministra " -lrb- female minister -rrb- , " abogada " -lrb- female lawyer -rrb- or " jefa " -lrb- female boss -rrb- now forming part of everyday speech . a police officer is no longer just " un agente de policia " -lrb- word of masculine gender -rrb- , but also " una agente de policia " -lrb- feminine -rrb- .
a soldier can be " un " or " una soldado . " language could not be transformed through government orders , but it would spontaneously change to reflect new realities , commentators said . " language is created every day , and some words triumph , while others do not , " philologist pilar careaga said . undeterred by her critics , aido has now launched a new campaign against domestic violence with the idea that real men are not violent . and despite the pp 's contempt for the activities of the equality ministry , party leader mariano rajoy recently appointed young women to top party posts , conscious that female votes contributed to zapatero 's election victory . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brinkmann is reportedly a leading figure in the international far-right scene with close contacts to germany 's far-right npd party .

former teacher andreas molau , a member of the npd 's national executive , is also a member of the foundation 's directorate .
brinkmann is also believed to be behind a further real estate purchase in germany , according to the spiegel .

" i do n't want the venue to be a distraction . " germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper said obama 's advisors had promised the chancellor he would not speak at the brandenburg gate . while welcoming the visit , merkel expressed reservations at the notion that obama could use the backdrop of the historic setting to promote his bid to become the next president of the united states . she was joined in this view on sunday by conservative christian social union politician erwin huber , who said obama should not be granted the privilege to speak there because he had played no rule in german unification . historic site the brandenburg gate has strong historical overtones .
it was the symbol of german division when the berlin wall cut across it and later of unification after the wall fell in 1989 . former presidents ronald reagan and bill clinton made key speeches there while in office .
in 1987 reagan urged the soviet union 's last communist leader mikhail gorbachev to tear down the wall . but not everyone is opposed to obama speaking there .

pope benedict xvi speaks to reporters on his plane pope benedict xvi has begun a nine-day visit to australia , where he is due to apologise for decades of sexual abuse of children by priests .
as he began the longest foreign trip of his papacy , he said paedophilia was " incompatible " with being a priest .
australian abuse victims have said they will hold protests during his visit .
climate change will also be a leading theme at a major catholic youth festival , world youth day , which the pope is heading in sydney .
the event is expected to draw some 200,000 young catholics to the city .
but the six-day event has been overshadowed by the launch of an investigation into sexual abuse allegations .
the leader of australia 's catholics , cardinal george pell , has come under criticism for his handling of a 1982 case allegedly involving the sexual abuse of 29-year-old man by a priest .
the bbc 's nick bryant in sydney says that many victims want the pope to directly criticise the australian catholic hierarchy for its handling of abuse allegations .
lifestyle change " it is essential for the church to reconcile , to prevent , to help and to see guilt in this problem , " pope benedict told reporters during his 20-hour flight to sydney .
we have to face up to this great challenge ... to change the situation of the environment for the good pope benedict xvi in pictures : pope in australia " it must be clear ... that being a real priest is incompatible with this -lrb- sexual abuse -rrb- because priests are in the service of our lord , " he said .
as the pope arrived in sydney , australian prime minister kevin rudd said he was " an honoured guest among us " .
during his trip , the pope will also meet aborigine groups , and is likely to repeat an apology made by pope john paul to australia 's indigenous people for injustices carried out by catholic missionaries .
he also told reporters he wanted to wake up consciences , to make politicians and experts respond to environmental issues .
" we have to face up to this great challenge and find the ethical capacity to change the situation of the environment for the good , " said pope benedict .
but he made it clear he had no intention of addressing any specific political or technical questions about climate change .
open-air mass the 81-year pope 's medical advisers have taken elaborate steps to protect his health during the gruelling 20-hour flight from italy , says the bbc 's david willey in rome .
a special sleeping compartment has been prepared on the alitalia plane and the german pontiff will spend three full days resting at a catholic study centre before appearing at the head of a sydney harbour flotilla on thursday .
he was met by australian prime minister kevin rudd on his arrival at sydney airport .
pope benedict will close his trip by presiding over an open-air mass on 20 july at sydney 's randwick racecourse , which is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of pilgrims .
the pope 's visit - his ninth outside italy - has created controversy with demonstrators vowing to protest against the church 's stand on homosexuality and birth control .
in response , authorities in the state of new south wales have introduced new laws bringing the threat of heavy fines to anyone causing annoyance to pilgrims .
civil liberty groups have denounced such sanctions as unnecessary and repugnant .

pope benedict xvi speaks to reporters on his plane pope benedict xvi has begun a nine-day visit to australia , where he is due to apologise for decades of sexual abuse of children by priests .
as he began the longest foreign trip of his papacy , he said paedophilia was " incompatible " with being a priest .
australian abuse victims have said they will hold protests during his visit .
climate change will also be a leading theme at a major catholic youth festival , world youth day , which the pope is heading in sydney .
the event is expected to draw some 200,000 young catholics to the city .
but the six-day event has been overshadowed by the launch of an investigation into sexual abuse allegations .
the leader of australia 's catholics , cardinal george pell , has come under criticism for his handling of a 1982 case allegedly involving the sexual abuse of 29-year-old man by a priest .
the bbc 's nick bryant in sydney says that many victims want the pope to directly criticise the australian catholic hierarchy for its handling of abuse allegations .
lifestyle change " it is essential for the church to reconcile , to prevent , to help and to see guilt in this problem , " pope benedict told reporters during his 20-hour flight to sydney .
we have to face up to this great challenge ... to change the situation of the environment for the good pope benedict xvi in pictures : pope in australia " it must be clear ... that being a real priest is incompatible with this -lrb- sexual abuse -rrb- because priests are in the service of our lord , " he said .
as the pope arrived in sydney , australian prime minister kevin rudd said he was " an honoured guest among us " .
during his trip , the pope will also meet aborigine groups , and is likely to repeat an apology made by pope john paul to australia 's indigenous people for injustices carried out by catholic missionaries .
he also told reporters he wanted to wake up consciences , to make politicians and experts respond to environmental issues .
" we have to face up to this great challenge and find the ethical capacity to change the situation of the environment for the good , " said pope benedict .
but he made it clear he had no intention of addressing any specific political or technical questions about climate change .
open-air mass the 81-year pope 's medical advisers have taken elaborate steps to protect his health during the gruelling 20-hour flight from italy , says the bbc 's david willey in rome .
a special sleeping compartment has been prepared on the alitalia plane and the german pontiff will spend three full days resting at a catholic study centre before appearing at the head of a sydney harbour flotilla on thursday .
he was met by australian prime minister kevin rudd on his arrival at sydney airport .
pope benedict will close his trip by presiding over an open-air mass on 20 july at sydney 's randwick racecourse , which is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of pilgrims .
the pope 's visit - his ninth outside italy - has created controversy with demonstrators vowing to protest against the church 's stand on homosexuality and birth control .
in response , authorities in the state of new south wales have introduced new laws bringing the threat of heavy fines to anyone causing annoyance to pilgrims .
civil liberty groups have denounced such sanctions as unnecessary and repugnant .

he says he has been the victim of an unprovoked attack with a bottle .
he thinks he is lucky it was not a knife .
his mates think the man who did it was a coward , because he used a weapon rather than his fists .

people i know carry knives - they have to protect themselves because there are other people out there who want to harm them vala saedi the police in this town have actually been very successful at cutting down violent disorder , and in particular knife crime .

pc nick surridge is part of the team working with the arch .
he says : " we choose our locations by looking at crime statistics or if there 's anywhere having a special event .
we 'll also go back on a fairly regular basis to deter people from continually bringing knives or any type of weapon into the town centre .
" people are more than happy to be searched because they then know they 're going into a safe venue .

federal regulators seized the bank 's assets , fearing it might not be able to meet withdrawals by depositors .
it is the second-largest financial institution to fail in us history , regulators say .
the failure came on a day when shares in the two biggest us home loan institutions - freddie mac and fannie mae - fell at one stage by almost 50 % .
indymac had been struggling to raise funds and stay in business in one of the states worst hit by the us housing market slump .
the bank 's primary regulator , the office of thrift supervision -lrb- ots -rrb- , said depositors had withdrawn more than $ 1.3bn in the past 11 days .
" this institution failed today due to a liquidity crisis , " ots director john reich said .
i 'm very angry , very upset about this .
i wanted to withdraw my money steve knieerein indymac customer the ots believed indymac was unlikely to meet its depositors ' demands and transferred its operations to the federal deposit insurance corporation -lrb- fdic -rrb- , which will seek a buyer .
indymac customer steve knieerein told abc television : " i 'm very angry , very upset about this .
i wanted to withdraw my money . "
people with deposits of up to $ 100,000 each are covered by insurers .
but about 10,000 people had uninsured funds over that limit with indymac - worth a total $ 1bn at the time of closing .
the fdic said it would pay those people an advance dividend equal to half of their uninsured deposit .
it is the fifth us financial institution this year to succumb amid a credit crunch , falling house prices and rising foreclosures .
the move came after rollercoaster trading on friday for freddie mac and fannie mae - which are behind half of all us mortgages .
they play an important role in the financial markets in providing funding for home loans by buying up mortgages and packaging them as investments .
' important mission ' as mortgage backers , the companies have had to pay out when homeowners have defaulted on their loans .
both firms defended their finances , saying they had enough capital to weather the housing slump .
today our primary focus is supporting fannie mae and freddie mac in their current form as they carry out their important mission treasury secretary henry paulson q & a : freddie mac and fannie mae shares in the two firms recovered after us treasury secretary henry paulson signalled he was not on the verge of taking fannie mae and freddie mac into public hands .
" our primary focus is supporting fannie mae and freddie mac in their current form as they carry out their important mission , " he said .
president george w bush was briefed on fannie mae and freddie mac earlier on friday .
mr bush said mr paulson assured him he and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke " will be working this issue very hard " .
after a volatile trading session , freddie mac shares closed down 3.1 % at $ 7.75 .
shares of fannie mae ended the day down 22.4 % at $ 10.25 after sliding as much as 49 % to a 19-year low of $ 6.68 .
us senator christopher dodd said the federal reserve was considering allowing fannie mae and freddie mac to borrow directly from the central bank , which also helped the shares to recover .
some media reported the treasury was planning some kind of government-led rescue but mr paulson said only that they were " maintaining a dialogue with regulators and with the companies " .

federal regulators seized the bank 's assets , fearing it might not be able to meet withdrawals by depositors .
it is the second-largest financial institution to fail in us history , regulators say .
the failure came on a day when shares in the two biggest us home loan institutions - freddie mac and fannie mae - fell at one stage by almost 50 % .
indymac had been struggling to raise funds and stay in business in one of the states worst hit by the us housing market slump .
the bank 's primary regulator , the office of thrift supervision -lrb- ots -rrb- , said depositors had withdrawn more than $ 1.3bn in the past 11 days .
" this institution failed today due to a liquidity crisis , " ots director john reich said .
i 'm very angry , very upset about this .
i wanted to withdraw my money steve knieerein indymac customer the ots believed indymac was unlikely to meet its depositors ' demands and transferred its operations to the federal deposit insurance corporation -lrb- fdic -rrb- , which will seek a buyer .
indymac customer steve knieerein told abc television : " i 'm very angry , very upset about this .
i wanted to withdraw my money . "
people with deposits of up to $ 100,000 each are covered by insurers .
but about 10,000 people had uninsured funds over that limit with indymac - worth a total $ 1bn at the time of closing .
the fdic said it would pay those people an advance dividend equal to half of their uninsured deposit .
it is the fifth us financial institution this year to succumb amid a credit crunch , falling house prices and rising foreclosures .
the move came after rollercoaster trading on friday for freddie mac and fannie mae - which are behind half of all us mortgages .
they play an important role in the financial markets in providing funding for home loans by buying up mortgages and packaging them as investments .
' important mission ' as mortgage backers , the companies have had to pay out when homeowners have defaulted on their loans .
both firms defended their finances , saying they had enough capital to weather the housing slump .

" our primary focus is supporting fannie mae and freddie mac in their current form as they carry out their important mission , " he said .
president george w bush was briefed on fannie mae and freddie mac earlier on friday .
mr bush said mr paulson assured him he and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke " will be working this issue very hard " .
after a volatile trading session , freddie mac shares closed down 3.1 % at $ 7.75 .
shares of fannie mae ended the day down 22.4 % at $ 10.25 after sliding as much as 49 % to a 19-year low of $ 6.68 .
us senator christopher dodd said the federal reserve was considering allowing fannie mae and freddie mac to borrow directly from the central bank , which also helped the shares to recover .
some media reported the treasury was planning some kind of government-led rescue but mr paulson said only that they were " maintaining a dialogue with regulators and with the companies " .

by jonathan marcus bbc diplomatic correspondent , jerusalem some have dismissed mr sarkozy 's plan as " showy multilateralism " the inaugural summit of the union for the mediterranean is very much the personal initiative of french president nicolas sarkozy .
it represents a bold effort to get france - and indeed europe as a whole - more involved with north africa and the middle east .
but the french president 's ambitions may inevitably be circumscribed from the outset .
it is easy to dismiss mr sarkozy 's grand vision of a union for the mediterranean .
even some of the french newspapers have written off the scheme as a kind of " showy multilateralism " in tune with mr sarkozy 's showy life-style .
it is true there is not yet much substance to the plan - it is a kind of warming-over of the old barcelona process of dialogue between europe and the mediterranean initiated by another gaullist , president jacques chirac in 1995 .
but it would be wrong to dismiss his successor 's efforts .
astute game mr sarkozy is playing an astute game .
he has seized this opportunity to rehabilitate his syrian counterpart president bashar assad .
last month mr sarkozy spoke before the israeli parliament as a robust friend of israel .
he has also strongly condemned iran 's nuclear ambitions .
what it all amounts to is an attempt to re-energise france , and by extension , europe 's role in the middle east .
the opening to syria is especially interesting at a time when that country is engaged in indirect peace talks with israel .
president sarkozy wants to add france 's weight as a facilitator .
but in the end it may amount to little .
what syria and iran really want - an end to isolation for example or a security dialogue - they can not get from france or the europeans , but only from washington .
french diplomacy may help to help fill the vacuum of the closing months of the bush administration .
but it is the next man in the white house who counts in middle eastern diplomacy and not mr sarkozy or his union .
