coinciding with the release , a german university is investigating the trauma of the victims . the movie picks up a story long neglected in german post-war history : the plight of rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii .
" a woman in berlin " premiered at septembers ' film festival in toronto and is being released in theaters across germany on thursday , oct .
23 .
the movie is based on the autobiographical account of marta hiller , a young woman in berlin between the months of april and june in 1945 .
when the book was published anonymously in the 1950s , reactions were overwhelmingly negative .
from flop to bestseller a republished edition hit the shelves only as late as 2003 - - two years after hiller 's death - - and proved to be a bestseller .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their men gone , women were left to pick up the pieces the lead role is portrayed by german actress nina hoss , playing the young woman as soviet soldiers entered berlin in may 1945 .
she 's raped several times by red army soldiers until she eventually enters into a relationship with a russian officer to shield herself from further attacks .
rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii have long been a difficult chapter in german history , especially in communist east germany , where any criticism of the russian army was impossible .
" for the first time the phenomenon of mass rapes at the end of the war is the subject of a german movie , " said jochen-konrad fromme , a german parliamentarian and a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that means that 63 years after the end of the war , the fate and suffering of hundreds of thousands of german women is being acknowledged for the first time , " he added .
millions of victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress nina hoss says her character ' went through hell ' fromme added that historians estimate around 2 million women became victims of rape after the war .
cases of sexual violence also occurred in the western part of germany under the allied forces , yet historians agree that the problem was particularly acute under the soviet army .
coinciding with the release of the movie , the university of greifswald in northeastern germany has launched a research project to study the trauma of women raped during that period .
phillip kuwert , who is heading the project , said that it will help to analyze the long-term psychological effects .
better methods of treatment could then be developed for other conflict or war zones .
german newspapers have reacted with mixed reviews to " a woman in berlin . "
some critics are bashing the filmmakers for treating the serious subject on a level way too trivial and sentimental .
others praise the movie for bringing a chapter of german history to a wider audience which so far many people have been ill-informed about . dw staff -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" industry indicators predict weak overall economic activity in the third quarter , which should continue into 2009 , " the report said .

the report noted that germany 's crucial export sector is likely to hobble the economy at some point .

but the crisis will be felt through a slowdown in the global economy , " said the report , which included previously published data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will german cars sell in a recession ?
the report said the " weakness of the global economy has weighed on exports " that contribute significantly to the economy , given that germany is the world 's leading exporter .
the government forecasts annual growth this year of 1.7 percent , owing to an exceptionally dynamic first quarter , but recently slashed its estimate for 2009 to just 0.2 percent .
third-quarter figures are expected in mid-november , but officials have warned gross domestic product would probably be " almost unchanged " from the second quarter , when it contracted by 0.5 percent .
two quarters running of economic contraction are the commonly accepted definition of a recession .

at least for now .
the little fish , also known as salomon ugborugo , was the head of the ivory coast company , which in 2006 agreed to dispose of 500 tons of liquid waste for the big fish - - otherwise known as dutch multinational firm trafigura . ugborugo 's company did get rid of the waste .
the problem was , they did so without treating it , and the resulting fumes killed an estimated 17 people and have made an estimated 100,000 people in abidjan ill . now , for his role ugborugo is looking at 20 years behind bars .
his partner at the city ’ s port will get 5 years .
ugborugo 's lawyer says he 's appalled by the verdict . " the element of intention was clearly missing .
i would have understood if he was only condemned of involuntary homicide . "
the lawyer insists that his client hadn ’ t been aware that the waste was so dangerous . who is to blame ?
the trail leads to the netherlands it ’ s hard to say how much ugborugo actually knew about the dangerous load his company was dumping . but either way , if you follow the story back up the food chain , it doesn ’ t take long to get back to the netherlands-based trafigura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the clearing efforts , much of the toxic waste is still polluting the area marietta harjono from green peace international , says she hopes the buck doesn ’ t just stop with ugborugo .
" trafigura is a big , multi-billion dollar oil company , " she says .
" the only goal is to make as much money as possible . " trafigura had tried to dispose of the waste in amsterdam , hiding the fact that it was toxic .
but once the truth came out , the tanker full of toxic liquid shipped off to africa , hoping to bypass the hundreds of thousands euros it would have cost to safely treat the material . and that ’ s when the trafigura story merged with ugborugo ’ s . 200 million to avoid a lawsuit when it became clear what had made people sick in abidjan , trafigura paid ivory coast more than $ 200 million to avoid a lawsuit in the west african country .
it seems like a lot , but that amount could be peanuts compared to what the disaster has actually cost ivory coast in terms of health care and environmental clean up costs . with that in mind the netherlands has announced it ’ s suing trafigura for illegal dumping practices and a law firm in england has agreed to bring a suit against the company on behalf of 30,000 plaintiffs affected by the waste in abidjan .
unfortunately for the residents of abidjan , regardless of the outcomes in the courts , the nightmare continues , with much of the toxic waste still polluting the air . eric heath -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economic ties , but also human rights and global warming , were on the meeting agenda , advisers said . at the start of her trip to beijing , merkel spoke of germany 's interest in creating " solid german-chinese economic ties , " and held up the daimler-chinese cooperation as an example .
merkel was at daimler for the celebration of the 25,000th daimler car to roll off the production line in beijing ; she was set to meet chinese premier wen jiabao in the afternoon of thursday , oct .
23 , for talks that are expected to focus on the global financial crisis .
the two leaders will then join some 40 other heads of state at the biannual asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- on friday and saturday .
merkel visit stresses importance of ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel feted the successful automobile cooperation german officials said the fact that merkel was one of the few foreign leaders making a formal state visit to china for the asem summit showed the importance of ties between the two nations .
the world financial crisis , and global warming , are expected to be the main focal points of the asem summit , which groups 27 european and 16 asian nations .
merkel is scheduled to meet president hu jintao on friday .
her talks with chinese leaders will deal with bilateral political and economic ties , as well as north korea 's heavily disputed atomic program , and relations with iran , german politicians told reporters .
moreover , merkel will meet with non-politicians such as journalists and writers .
the trip to china is merkel 's fist since she met with tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama last year , which led to strained ties between beijing and berlin .
calls for discussion on human rights green party politician volker beck told afp news service that he hoped merkel would bring up the " continuing poor state of human rights " in china , and urged her not to let the subject be overshadowed by talks of the financial crisis .
meanwhile , two other human-rights groups appealed to merkel to use the meetings to address human-rights issues , specifically the situation of china 's tibetan and uighur minorities .
merkel should press china for " tangible results from the dialogue between the dalai lama 's representatives and chinese officials , " kate saunders , communications director of the international campaign for tibet , told dpa press agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's 2007 meeting with the dalai lama shook china relations and a european-based group representing china 's mainly muslim uighur urged the german leader to press china to allow international investigation of claims that uighurs were involved in several plots to attack the beijing olympic games in august .
relations back to normal after dalai lama visit thomas steg , a deputy spokesman for merkel , told dpa that the chancellor would indeed raise human rights issues during her china visit .
" she 'll bring it up , " he said .
ruprecht polenz , a foreign affairs spokesman for merkel 's party , the christian democratic union , insisted that china-germany relations were back to normal after beijing 's displeasure at merkel meeting in her office last year with the dalai lama .
but polenz , who chairs the parliamentary committee on foreign policy , acknowledged that " human rights remain a problem issue . "

" awarding the sakharov to hu jia is a reflection of the very spirit of this prize , which supports free thought and honors human rights defenders fighting repression , " greens leaders daniel cohn-bendit and monica frassoni said in a statement . hu is currently serving a three-and-a-half-year jail term on charges of subversion .
beijing on thursday insisted that hu is a criminal . " to issue an award to such a criminal amounts to interference in china 's judicial sovereignty and is totally against the purpose of this prize , " said government spokesman qin gang . the sakharov award announcement comes just one day ahead of an asia-europe summit , but qin declined to say whether hu 's recognition would have a negative impact on the talks . uncovering a ' state secret ' hu 's activism began in the late 1990s when the economics graduate volunteered to work on environmental projects . in 2001 , he began helping villagers infected with hiv / aids through blood-selling schemes in the central province of henan .
the following year , hu and four friends had their first run-in with state security police who intercepted them and seized film after they traveled to henan villages . the group took christmas toys and clothes to children in poor villages that were decimated due to aids spread by the illegal collection and sale of blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hu said the sars epidemic helped draw awareness to the aids problem in china " it seemed like the worst scenes of aids in africa , with old and young people infected , " hu told dpa news agency .
" state security police threatened us and said that aids was a state secret , " he said . hu said he believes that china was " lucky " to be shaken out of its complacency on aids by the scandal over a cover-up of hundreds of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- in beijing . " after sars in 2003 , nobody dared to say that aids was a state secret any more , " hu said .

23 , for defending the rights of people living with hiv / aids . " awarding the sakharov to hu jia is a reflection of the very spirit of this prize , which supports free thought and honors human rights defenders fighting repression , " greens leaders daniel cohn-bendit and monica frassoni said in a statement . hu is currently serving a three-and-a-half-year jail term on charges of subversion .
beijing on thursday insisted that hu is a criminal . " to issue an award to such a criminal amounts to interference in china 's judicial sovereignty and is totally against the purpose of this prize , " said government spokesman qin gang . the sakharov award announcement comes just one day ahead of an asia-europe summit , but qin declined to say whether hu 's recognition would have a negative impact on the talks . uncovering a ' state secret ' hu 's activism began in the late 1990s when the economics graduate volunteered to work on environmental projects . in 2001 , he began helping villagers infected with hiv / aids through blood-selling schemes in the central province of henan .

at least for now .
the little fish , also known as salomon ugborugo , was the head of the ivory coast company , which in 2006 agreed to dispose of 500 tons of liquid waste for the big fish - - otherwise known as dutch multinational firm trafigura . ugborugo 's company did get rid of the waste .
the problem was , they did so without treating it , and the resulting fumes killed an estimated 17 people and have made an estimated 100,000 people in abidjan ill . now , for his role ugborugo is looking at 20 years behind bars .
his partner at the city ’ s port will get 5 years .
ugborugo 's lawyer says he 's appalled by the verdict . " the element of intention was clearly missing .
i would have understood if he was only condemned of involuntary homicide . "
the lawyer insists that his client hadn ’ t been aware that the waste was so dangerous . who is to blame ?
the trail leads to the netherlands it ’ s hard to say how much ugborugo actually knew about the dangerous load his company was dumping . but either way , if you follow the story back up the food chain , it doesn ’ t take long to get back to the netherlands-based trafigura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the clearing efforts , much of the toxic waste is still polluting the area marietta harjono from green peace international , says she hopes the buck doesn ’ t just stop with ugborugo .
" trafigura is a big , multi-billion dollar oil company , " she says .
" the only goal is to make as much money as possible . " trafigura had tried to dispose of the waste in amsterdam , hiding the fact that it was toxic .
but once the truth came out , the tanker full of toxic liquid shipped off to africa , hoping to bypass the hundreds of thousands euros it would have cost to safely treat the material . and that ’ s when the trafigura story merged with ugborugo ’ s . 200 million to avoid a lawsuit when it became clear what had made people sick in abidjan , trafigura paid ivory coast more than $ 200 million to avoid a lawsuit in the west african country .
it seems like a lot , but that amount could be peanuts compared to what the disaster has actually cost ivory coast in terms of health care and environmental clean up costs . with that in mind the netherlands has announced it ’ s suing trafigura for illegal dumping practices and a law firm in england has agreed to bring a suit against the company on behalf of 30,000 plaintiffs affected by the waste in abidjan .
unfortunately for the residents of abidjan , regardless of the outcomes in the courts , the nightmare continues , with much of the toxic waste still polluting the air . eric heath -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these securities lost much of their value when the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed in 2007 .
as the bank was recovering from this loss , it was hit a second time when interbank loans dried up in mid-september . reports of kemmer 's resignation come just one day after bavarian finance minister and head of bayernlb 's supervisory board erwin huber said he was quitting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumor comes on the heels of the bavarian finance minister 's departure bayernlb became the first german financial house to apply for aid this week when it asked for 5.4 billion euros from berlin 's bank rescue plan . bayernlb also announced wednesday it was launching a review of all its costs , including the the bank 's 19,000 world-wide labor force with the bank having already warned that it might not be able to avoid job cuts .
former ikb execs also feeling the pain but managers at bayern lb are n't the only ones to be feeling the heat of the financial meltdown .
former executives at german bank ikb have been told to pay back bonuses worth millions of euros that they earned before the bank had to be rescued by the government , a spokesman for the bank said thursday .
the bank , which specializes in corporate loans , has told six bankers to return a total of three million euros -lrb- 3.9 million dollars -rrb- , according to agence france presse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six ikb executives have been told to return bonuses " a new assessment of the bank 's accounts for the period 2006-7 has shown the good financial performances that these bonuses were based to be invalid , " the spokesman told afp .
the executives include former chief executive stefan ortseifen who has been told to pay back 805,000 euros -lrb- 1 million dollars -rrb- .
though he quit in july , he is also being sued by the bank over his actions leading up to a government-led rescue earlier this year .
two others have been told that they have until the end of the month to pay back the money , while a third - reportedly still on ikb 's board - has already returned 558,000 euros -lrb- 730,980 dollars -rrb- .
ikb , which had invested heavily in toxic securities linked to subprime mortgages , became the first big casualty of the subprime crisis in germany .

coinciding with the release , a german university is investigating the trauma of the victims . the movie picks up a story long neglected in german post-war history : the plight of rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii .
" a woman in berlin " premiered at septembers ' film festival in toronto and is being released in theaters across germany on thursday , oct .
23 .
the movie is based on the autobiographical account of marta hiller , a young woman in berlin between the months of april and june in 1945 .
when the book was published anonymously in the 1950s , reactions were overwhelmingly negative .
from flop to bestseller a republished edition hit the shelves only as late as 2003 - - two years after hiller 's death - - and proved to be a bestseller .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their men gone , women were left to pick up the pieces the lead role is portrayed by german actress nina hoss , playing the young woman as soviet soldiers entered berlin in may 1945 .
she 's raped several times by red army soldiers until she eventually enters into a relationship with a russian officer to shield herself from further attacks .
rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii have long been a difficult chapter in german history , especially in communist east germany , where any criticism of the russian army was impossible .
" for the first time the phenomenon of mass rapes at the end of the war is the subject of a german movie , " said jochen-konrad fromme , a german parliamentarian and a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that means that 63 years after the end of the war , the fate and suffering of hundreds of thousands of german women is being acknowledged for the first time , " he added .
millions of victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress nina hoss says her character ' went through hell ' fromme added that historians estimate around 2 million women became victims of rape after the war .
cases of sexual violence also occurred in the western part of germany under the allied forces , yet historians agree that the problem was particularly acute under the soviet army .
coinciding with the release of the movie , the university of greifswald in northeastern germany has launched a research project to study the trauma of women raped during that period .
phillip kuwert , who is heading the project , said that it will help to analyze the long-term psychological effects .
better methods of treatment could then be developed for other conflict or war zones .
german newspapers have reacted with mixed reviews to " a woman in berlin . "
some critics are bashing the filmmakers for treating the serious subject on a level way too trivial and sentimental .
others praise the movie for bringing a chapter of german history to a wider audience which so far many people have been ill-informed about . dw staff -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the movie is based on the autobiographical account of marta hiller , a young woman in berlin between the months of april and june in 1945 .
when the book was published anonymously in the 1950s , reactions were overwhelmingly negative .
from flop to bestseller a republished edition hit the shelves only as late as 2003 - - two years after hiller 's death - - and proved to be a bestseller .

cases of sexual violence also occurred in the western part of germany under the allied forces , yet historians agree that the problem was particularly acute under the soviet army .
coinciding with the release of the movie , the university of greifswald in northeastern germany has launched a research project to study the trauma of women raped during that period .
phillip kuwert , who is heading the project , said that it will help to analyze the long-term psychological effects .

german newspapers have reacted with mixed reviews to " a woman in berlin . "

in return , the french state would temporarily buy stakes in the firms . " large french companies ca n't be allowed to fall into foreign hands just because we do n't react to the financial crisis , " sarkozy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says the financial crisis underlines the need for governments to intervene in the economy earlier this week , sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , stirred debate in the european parliament with his plan to partially nationalize key industries with the help of state funds . sarkozy argued that the sovereign wealth fund would help to prevent countries such as china and other gulf nations taking over large european companies by using current stock plunges to buy up shares in eu firms . " i do n't want european citizens to wake up in a few months and discover that european companies belong to non-european capitals , " he said . germany resists plan germany , which last week passed a 500-million-euro rescue package for its troubled banks , reacted sharply to the french proposal on thursday , saying saying any measures must be compatible with european union rules . " the german government believes that ... greater protection measures are not needed in germany , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
" it is also convinced that measures to protect against foreign takeovers must be compatible with -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market rules . " german chancellor angela merkel will discuss sarkozy 's idea with him on the sidelines of a two-day summit of european and asian countries beginning in beijing on friday , wilhelm said in a statement . earlier this week , german economy minister michael glos too dismissed the french plan . " the french proposal that the state should take stakes in european industry so as to protect it from foreign state takeover goes against the successful principles of our economic policy , " glos said . " current state intervention in the banking and insurance sector are an indispensable exception so as to prevent a possible breakdown of financial flows and help protect jobs and growth , " glos said . sarkozy vows more state investment in addition to the sovereign wealth fund , sarkozy unveiled measures to stimulate the french economy . his administration plans to scrap corporate tax on new investments until 2010 and inject 175 billion euros in infrastructure . " in the past 20 years , france has lagged in infrastructure , " sarkozy said , adding that investments were needed in new energies , universities and public transportation . " governments have to become more active in the economy , " he said .

but this week 's education summit missed the mark , says dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen . unfortunately , the politicians at the education summit in dresden on wednesday , oct .
22 , did n't present any solutions that fit the problem .
education is often a topic that gets politicians on their soap boxes .
but at the summit , the issue was once again used as a means to boost their political images .
the result was nothing more than expressions of good intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen " education should be top priority in germany , " they concluded .
yes , but was n't it top priority before ?
in dresden , state and federal delegations agreed to halve the number of high school and college dropouts .
that 's been called for many times , but changes have yet to be seen .
the state and federal governments have also said they want to increase the education budget by 10 percent by the year 2015 .
that sounds good - but no one has said how they plan to reach this goal .
money for banks , not for education it 's amazing that it is possible to decide on a billion-euro rescue package for the troubled finance industry in just a few days , but that it is apparently unfeasible to agree on financing germany 's most important resource - education .
what was announced on wednesday was merely symbolic : " look , we 've made it top priority ; we 'll take care of it . "
that sounds good , especially ahead of an election year in the federal parliament as well as several state governments .
after all , a committee was established to figure out how the ambitious goals can be financed .
but there wo n't be any results until after the 2009 bundestag election .
delay instead of action , that 's the motto .
' education for all ' still just a dream once again , the main problems with the german education system were n't addressed .
it 's a disaster that , in a wealthy country like germany , parents ' bank accounts still determine their children 's education options .
former chancellor willy brandt 's appeal in the 1970s for " education for all " has never been fulfilled .
the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school and the working class child goes to the third-tier tech school - that 's still often the case .
children with so-called non-academic backgrounds or from immigrant families are n't challenged enough and their potential goes unrecognized .
germany 's education budget is well below the average of many other industrial countries .
particularly in the elementary schools , much less is invested per child than elsewhere .
germany is the only country in the world that demands several hundred euros a month from young parents so their child can attend pre-school .
education path determined too early furthermore , in no other country does the selection process - the sorting of children into various types of schools - begin so early .
a pupil 's educational path is decided after the fourth grade .
the familiar learning environment , where children learn well and yet differentiated , gets lost . nearly all german education experts agree that the solution is for pupils to spend more time learning together in a positive environment , without pressure to perform .
but in dresden , concrete steps and strategies were n't discussed .
chancellor angela merkel praised wednesday 's resolutions as an important step toward an " education republic of germany . "
but , as one newspaper commented , the " education illusion of germany " would be a more appropriate term .

in return , the french state would temporarily buy stakes in the firms . " large french companies ca n't be allowed to fall into foreign hands just because we do n't react to the financial crisis , " sarkozy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says the financial crisis underlines the need for governments to intervene in the economy earlier this week , sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , stirred debate in the european parliament with his plan to partially nationalize key industries with the help of state funds . sarkozy argued that the sovereign wealth fund would help to prevent countries such as china and other gulf nations taking over large european companies by using current stock plunges to buy up shares in eu firms . " i do n't want european citizens to wake up in a few months and discover that european companies belong to non-european capitals , " he said . germany resists plan germany , which last week passed a 500-million-euro rescue package for its troubled banks , reacted sharply to the french proposal on thursday , saying saying any measures must be compatible with european union rules . " the german government believes that ... greater protection measures are not needed in germany , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
" it is also convinced that measures to protect against foreign takeovers must be compatible with -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market rules . " german chancellor angela merkel will discuss sarkozy 's idea with him on the sidelines of a two-day summit of european and asian countries beginning in beijing on friday , wilhelm said in a statement . earlier this week , german economy minister michael glos too dismissed the french plan . " the french proposal that the state should take stakes in european industry so as to protect it from foreign state takeover goes against the successful principles of our economic policy , " glos said . " current state intervention in the banking and insurance sector are an indispensable exception so as to prevent a possible breakdown of financial flows and help protect jobs and growth , " glos said . sarkozy vows more state investment in addition to the sovereign wealth fund , sarkozy unveiled measures to stimulate the french economy . his administration plans to scrap corporate tax on new investments until 2010 and inject 175 billion euros in infrastructure . " in the past 20 years , france has lagged in infrastructure , " sarkozy said , adding that investments were needed in new energies , universities and public transportation . " governments have to become more active in the economy , " he said .

at least for now .
the little fish , also known as salomon ugborugo , was the head of the ivory coast company , which in 2006 agreed to dispose of 500 tons of liquid waste for the big fish - - otherwise known as dutch multinational firm trafigura . ugborugo 's company did get rid of the waste .
the problem was , they did so without treating it , and the resulting fumes killed an estimated 17 people and have made an estimated 100,000 people in abidjan ill . now , for his role ugborugo is looking at 20 years behind bars .
his partner at the city ’ s port will get 5 years .
ugborugo 's lawyer says he 's appalled by the verdict . " the element of intention was clearly missing .
i would have understood if he was only condemned of involuntary homicide . "
the lawyer insists that his client hadn ’ t been aware that the waste was so dangerous . who is to blame ?
the trail leads to the netherlands it ’ s hard to say how much ugborugo actually knew about the dangerous load his company was dumping . but either way , if you follow the story back up the food chain , it doesn ’ t take long to get back to the netherlands-based trafigura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the clearing efforts , much of the toxic waste is still polluting the area marietta harjono from green peace international , says she hopes the buck doesn ’ t just stop with ugborugo .
" trafigura is a big , multi-billion dollar oil company , " she says .
" the only goal is to make as much money as possible . " trafigura had tried to dispose of the waste in amsterdam , hiding the fact that it was toxic .
but once the truth came out , the tanker full of toxic liquid shipped off to africa , hoping to bypass the hundreds of thousands euros it would have cost to safely treat the material . and that ’ s when the trafigura story merged with ugborugo ’ s . 200 million to avoid a lawsuit when it became clear what had made people sick in abidjan , trafigura paid ivory coast more than $ 200 million to avoid a lawsuit in the west african country .
it seems like a lot , but that amount could be peanuts compared to what the disaster has actually cost ivory coast in terms of health care and environmental clean up costs . with that in mind the netherlands has announced it ’ s suing trafigura for illegal dumping practices and a law firm in england has agreed to bring a suit against the company on behalf of 30,000 plaintiffs affected by the waste in abidjan .
unfortunately for the residents of abidjan , regardless of the outcomes in the courts , the nightmare continues , with much of the toxic waste still polluting the air . eric heath -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at least for now .
the little fish , also known as salomon ugborugo , was the head of the ivory coast company , which in 2006 agreed to dispose of 500 tons of liquid waste for the big fish - - otherwise known as dutch multinational firm trafigura . ugborugo 's company did get rid of the waste .
the problem was , they did so without treating it , and the resulting fumes killed an estimated 17 people and have made an estimated 100,000 people in abidjan ill . now , for his role ugborugo is looking at 20 years behind bars .
his partner at the city ’ s port will get 5 years .
ugborugo 's lawyer says he 's appalled by the verdict . " the element of intention was clearly missing .
i would have understood if he was only condemned of involuntary homicide . "
the lawyer insists that his client hadn ’ t been aware that the waste was so dangerous . who is to blame ?
the trail leads to the netherlands it ’ s hard to say how much ugborugo actually knew about the dangerous load his company was dumping . but either way , if you follow the story back up the food chain , it doesn ’ t take long to get back to the netherlands-based trafigura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the clearing efforts , much of the toxic waste is still polluting the area marietta harjono from green peace international , says she hopes the buck doesn ’ t just stop with ugborugo .
" trafigura is a big , multi-billion dollar oil company , " she says .
" the only goal is to make as much money as possible . " trafigura had tried to dispose of the waste in amsterdam , hiding the fact that it was toxic .
but once the truth came out , the tanker full of toxic liquid shipped off to africa , hoping to bypass the hundreds of thousands euros it would have cost to safely treat the material . and that ’ s when the trafigura story merged with ugborugo ’ s . 200 million to avoid a lawsuit when it became clear what had made people sick in abidjan , trafigura paid ivory coast more than $ 200 million to avoid a lawsuit in the west african country .
it seems like a lot , but that amount could be peanuts compared to what the disaster has actually cost ivory coast in terms of health care and environmental clean up costs . with that in mind the netherlands has announced it ’ s suing trafigura for illegal dumping practices and a law firm in england has agreed to bring a suit against the company on behalf of 30,000 plaintiffs affected by the waste in abidjan .

in all , the government estimated that german banks had committed between one to five billion euros to investments with lehman brothers . however , spokesmen for the government as well as the insurance companies stressed that the money had not been lost and that it was covered by a fund created by a federation of private german banks . lehman brothers declared bankruptcy on september 15 , the same day that kfw , the german state-owned development bank , transferred more than 300 million euros to it .

former executives at german bank ikb have been told to pay back bonuses worth millions of euros that they earned before the bank had to be rescued by the government , a spokesman for the bank said thursday .
the bank , which specializes in corporate loans , has told six bankers to return a total of three million euros -lrb- 3.9 million dollars -rrb- , according to agence france presse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six ikb executives have been told to return bonuses " a new assessment of the bank 's accounts for the period 2006-7 has shown the good financial performances that these bonuses were based to be invalid , " the spokesman told afp .
the executives include former chief executive stefan ortseifen who has been told to pay back 805,000 euros -lrb- 1 million dollars -rrb- .
though he quit in july , he is also being sued by the bank over his actions leading up to a government-led rescue earlier this year .
two others have been told that they have until the end of the month to pay back the money , while a third - reportedly still on ikb 's board - has already returned 558,000 euros -lrb- 730,980 dollars -rrb- .
ikb , which had invested heavily in toxic securities linked to subprime mortgages , became the first big casualty of the subprime crisis in germany .

former executives at german bank ikb have been told to pay back bonuses worth millions of euros that they earned before the bank had to be rescued by the government , a spokesman for the bank said thursday .
the bank , which specializes in corporate loans , has told six bankers to return a total of three million euros -lrb- 3.9 million dollars -rrb- , according to agence france presse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six ikb executives have been told to return bonuses " a new assessment of the bank 's accounts for the period 2006-7 has shown the good financial performances that these bonuses were based to be invalid , " the spokesman told afp .
the executives include former chief executive stefan ortseifen who has been told to pay back 805,000 euros -lrb- 1 million dollars -rrb- .
though he quit in july , he is also being sued by the bank over his actions leading up to a government-led rescue earlier this year .
two others have been told that they have until the end of the month to pay back the money , while a third - reportedly still on ikb 's board - has already returned 558,000 euros -lrb- 730,980 dollars -rrb- .
ikb , which had invested heavily in toxic securities linked to subprime mortgages , became the first big casualty of the subprime crisis in germany .
it had to be rescued with several billion euros of public money in july - the same month in which the bonuses were paid out , according to the daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" industry indicators predict weak overall economic activity in the third quarter , which should continue into 2009 , " the report said .

the report noted that germany 's crucial export sector is likely to hobble the economy at some point .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will german cars sell in a recession ?
the report said the " weakness of the global economy has weighed on exports " that contribute significantly to the economy , given that germany is the world 's leading exporter .
the government forecasts annual growth this year of 1.7 percent , owing to an exceptionally dynamic first quarter , but recently slashed its estimate for 2009 to just 0.2 percent .
third-quarter figures are expected in mid-november , but officials have warned gross domestic product would probably be " almost unchanged " from the second quarter , when it contracted by 0.5 percent .
two quarters running of economic contraction are the commonly accepted definition of a recession .
vw predicts carmakers will suffer meanwhile , volkswagen chairman ferdinand piëch told a german newspaper that he expects the german car industry to face a prolonged downturn .

tough times ahead : for the second time in only three months german car giant daimler reduced its expected profit for the next quarter .
the expected annual profit drops from almost 8 down to 6 billion euros . german carmaker daimler ag became the first of the country 's key auto groups to report its third-quarter results , reducing its earnings forecast again in face of deepening economic gloom .

daimler chief dieter zetsche had three months previously reduced the group 's 2008 earnings to about 7.0 billion euros from 7.7 billion euros , amid concerns that high energy prices and the prospects of an economic downturn will keep car buyers away from showrooms .
the group 's third-quarter net earnings were 213 million euros , compared with a 1.53-billion-euro loss a year earlier , the company said .
the weak state of the auto business has resulted in analysts expecting the german car sector to begin offering discounts to try to encourage sales .
government aid for the troubled sector ?
germany car industry leaders have also launched a campaign for government aid to help the key export sector to limp through the current financial crisis .
stuttgart-based daimler confirmed last month that it was in talks to finally sever links with troubled us carmaker chrysler , selling off its remaining 19.9-percent stake to the us equity group cerberus capital management lp .
this comes just over a year after cerberus bought an 80.1-percent stake in chrysler from daimler , as the german carmaker moved to end its nine-year troubled relationship with the us vehicle group . dpa news agency -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tough times ahead : for the second time in only three months german car giant daimler reduced its expected profit for the next quarter .
the expected annual profit drops from almost 8 down to 6 billion euros . german carmaker daimler ag became the first of the country 's key auto groups to report its third-quarter results , reducing its earnings forecast again in face of deepening economic gloom .
the manufacturer of luxury mercedes-benz vehicles said it now expected to post operating profit in 2008 " of more than 6 billion euros " -lrb- $ 7.67 billion -rrb- .
high energy prices and economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will discounts help to encourage sales ?
daimler chief dieter zetsche had three months previously reduced the group 's 2008 earnings to about 7.0 billion euros from 7.7 billion euros , amid concerns that high energy prices and the prospects of an economic downturn will keep car buyers away from showrooms .
the group 's third-quarter net earnings were 213 million euros , compared with a 1.53-billion-euro loss a year earlier , the company said .
the weak state of the auto business has resulted in analysts expecting the german car sector to begin offering discounts to try to encourage sales .
government aid for the troubled sector ?
germany car industry leaders have also launched a campaign for government aid to help the key export sector to limp through the current financial crisis .
stuttgart-based daimler confirmed last month that it was in talks to finally sever links with troubled us carmaker chrysler , selling off its remaining 19.9-percent stake to the us equity group cerberus capital management lp .
this comes just over a year after cerberus bought an 80.1-percent stake in chrysler from daimler , as the german carmaker moved to end its nine-year troubled relationship with the us vehicle group . dpa news agency -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , for defending the rights of people living with hiv / aids . " awarding the sakharov to hu jia is a reflection of the very spirit of this prize , which supports free thought and honors human rights defenders fighting repression , " greens leaders daniel cohn-bendit and monica frassoni said in a statement . hu is currently serving a three-and-a-half-year jail term on charges of subversion .
beijing on thursday insisted that hu is a criminal . " to issue an award to such a criminal amounts to interference in china 's judicial sovereignty and is totally against the purpose of this prize , " said government spokesman qin gang . the sakharov award announcement comes just one day ahead of an asia-europe summit , but qin declined to say whether hu 's recognition would have a negative impact on the talks . uncovering a ' state secret ' hu 's activism began in the late 1990s when the economics graduate volunteered to work on environmental projects . in 2001 , he began helping villagers infected with hiv / aids through blood-selling schemes in the central province of henan .
the following year , hu and four friends had their first run-in with state security police who intercepted them and seized film after they traveled to henan villages . the group took christmas toys and clothes to children in poor villages that were decimated due to aids spread by the illegal collection and sale of blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hu said the sars epidemic helped draw awareness to the aids problem in china " it seemed like the worst scenes of aids in africa , with old and young people infected , " hu told dpa news agency .
" state security police threatened us and said that aids was a state secret , " he said . hu said he believes that china was " lucky " to be shaken out of its complacency on aids by the scandal over a cover-up of hundreds of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- in beijing . " after sars in 2003 , nobody dared to say that aids was a state secret any more , " hu said .
" it gave us an opportunity to be more open .

22 , several advisors to the french president have confirmed this strategy .
sarkozy 's ambition is based on his firm conviction that the crisis in georgia and the financial crisis both demonstrated that europe was in need of a strong leader .
according to le monde , sarkozy believes that without such an individual at the helm , the eu would never have been able to negotiate with moscow or decide on an effective plan to rescue european banks .
in addition , with ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty , there will be no stable presidency of the eu , elected for a period of 30 months , as the treaty had foreseen .
next eu presidencies not in euro zone as a result , the eu will be led by the euro-skeptic czech president vaclav klaus and his prime minister , mirek topolanek , beginning on jan .

in a speech before eu parliamentarians in strasbourg on tuesday , sarkozy said that " a meeting of -lrb- eu -rrb- finance ministers is not up to dealing with the crisis . "
german minister rejects joint economic governance only heads of state and government " have the democratic legitimacy " to decide such wide-ranging measures as the bank rescue plan , he said in strasbourg .
since the eurogroup has no legal existence , a euro zone president could be elected without resorting to a constitution .
or a decision could be taken to allow france - that is , sarkozy - to continue in a leadership position until the eu presidency reverts to a country that uses the euro , which would be spain in january 2010 .
however , it seems unlikely that other eu countries will go along with the idea .
in an interview published wednesday in the french business daily la tribune , german economics minister michael glos said the proposal of a single economic governance of euro zone countries was " not suitable for resolving the current problems . "

22 , several advisors to the french president have confirmed this strategy .
sarkozy 's ambition is based on his firm conviction that the crisis in georgia and the financial crisis both demonstrated that europe was in need of a strong leader .
according to le monde , sarkozy believes that without such an individual at the helm , the eu would never have been able to negotiate with moscow or decide on an effective plan to rescue european banks .
in addition , with ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty , there will be no stable presidency of the eu , elected for a period of 30 months , as the treaty had foreseen .
next eu presidencies not in euro zone as a result , the eu will be led by the euro-skeptic czech president vaclav klaus and his prime minister , mirek topolanek , beginning on jan .
1 , 2009 , with the prague government fighting for survival after a landslide defeat in recent regional elections .
in july 2009 , the eu will be headed by sweden , which - like the czechs - does not use the single currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next two eu presidency holders are outside the euro zone to avoid what he foresees as a paralysis in the eu , sarkozy sees the soon-to-be 16-member euro zone as an effective alternative , as it was on oct .
12 , when euro zone leaders formulated the european bank rescue plan at a summit in paris convened by the french president .
in a speech before eu parliamentarians in strasbourg on tuesday , sarkozy said that " a meeting of -lrb- eu -rrb- finance ministers is not up to dealing with the crisis . "
german minister rejects joint economic governance only heads of state and government " have the democratic legitimacy " to decide such wide-ranging measures as the bank rescue plan , he said in strasbourg .
since the eurogroup has no legal existence , a euro zone president could be elected without resorting to a constitution .
or a decision could be taken to allow france - that is , sarkozy - to continue in a leadership position until the eu presidency reverts to a country that uses the euro , which would be spain in january 2010 .
however , it seems unlikely that other eu countries will go along with the idea .
in an interview published wednesday in the french business daily la tribune , german economics minister michael glos said the proposal of a single economic governance of euro zone countries was " not suitable for resolving the current problems . "
the problems of individual eu member nations were diverse , he said , and the majority of economic policies should remain national decisions . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

saying that the scanners " have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens " , the lawmakers voted on a non-binding resolution asking the bloc 's executive european commission to carry out an economic , medical and human rights assessment of the impact of using full-body scanners .
body scanners use radio waves to display full-body images that reveal whether passengers are concealing weapons or explosives under their clothes .
the commission proposed last month that the scanners be added to a list of security measures that can be used at airports in the 27-country bloc .

the scanners are already in use at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports to speed up security checks and to avoid hand-frisking passengers .

saying that the scanners " have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens " , the lawmakers voted on a non-binding resolution asking the bloc 's executive european commission to carry out an economic , medical and human rights assessment of the impact of using full-body scanners .
body scanners use radio waves to display full-body images that reveal whether passengers are concealing weapons or explosives under their clothes .

in return , the french state would temporarily buy stakes in the firms . " large french companies ca n't be allowed to fall into foreign hands just because we do n't react to the financial crisis , " sarkozy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says the financial crisis underlines the need for governments to intervene in the economy earlier this week , sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , stirred debate in the european parliament with his plan to partially nationalize key industries with the help of state funds . sarkozy argued that the sovereign wealth fund would help to prevent countries such as china and other gulf nations taking over large european companies by using current stock plunges to buy up shares in eu firms . " i do n't want european citizens to wake up in a few months and discover that european companies belong to non-european capitals , " he said . germany resists plan germany , which last week passed a 500-million-euro rescue package for its troubled banks , reacted sharply to the french proposal on thursday , saying saying any measures must be compatible with european union rules . " the german government believes that ... greater protection measures are not needed in germany , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
" it is also convinced that measures to protect against foreign takeovers must be compatible with -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market rules . " german chancellor angela merkel will discuss sarkozy 's idea with him on the sidelines of a two-day summit of european and asian countries beginning in beijing on friday , wilhelm said in a statement . earlier this week , german economy minister michael glos too dismissed the french plan . " the french proposal that the state should take stakes in european industry so as to protect it from foreign state takeover goes against the successful principles of our economic policy , " glos said . " current state intervention in the banking and insurance sector are an indispensable exception so as to prevent a possible breakdown of financial flows and help protect jobs and growth , " glos said . sarkozy vows more state investment in addition to the sovereign wealth fund , sarkozy unveiled measures to stimulate the french economy . his administration plans to scrap corporate tax on new investments until 2010 and inject 175 billion euros in infrastructure . " in the past 20 years , france has lagged in infrastructure , " sarkozy said , adding that investments were needed in new energies , universities and public transportation .

economic ties , but also human rights and global warming , were on the meeting agenda , advisers said . at the start of her trip to beijing , merkel spoke of germany 's interest in creating " solid german-chinese economic ties , " and held up the daimler-chinese cooperation as an example .
merkel was at daimler for the celebration of the 25,000th daimler car to roll off the production line in beijing ; she was set to meet chinese premier wen jiabao in the afternoon of thursday , oct .
23 , for talks that are expected to focus on the global financial crisis .
the two leaders will then join some 40 other heads of state at the biannual asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- on friday and saturday .
merkel visit stresses importance of ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel feted the successful automobile cooperation german officials said the fact that merkel was one of the few foreign leaders making a formal state visit to china for the asem summit showed the importance of ties between the two nations .
the world financial crisis , and global warming , are expected to be the main focal points of the asem summit , which groups 27 european and 16 asian nations .
merkel is scheduled to meet president hu jintao on friday .
her talks with chinese leaders will deal with bilateral political and economic ties , as well as north korea 's heavily disputed atomic program , and relations with iran , german politicians told reporters .
moreover , merkel will meet with non-politicians such as journalists and writers .
the trip to china is merkel 's fist since she met with tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama last year , which led to strained ties between beijing and berlin .
calls for discussion on human rights green party politician volker beck told afp news service that he hoped merkel would bring up the " continuing poor state of human rights " in china , and urged her not to let the subject be overshadowed by talks of the financial crisis .
meanwhile , two other human-rights groups appealed to merkel to use the meetings to address human-rights issues , specifically the situation of china 's tibetan and uighur minorities .
merkel should press china for " tangible results from the dialogue between the dalai lama 's representatives and chinese officials , " kate saunders , communications director of the international campaign for tibet , told dpa press agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's 2007 meeting with the dalai lama shook china relations and a european-based group representing china 's mainly muslim uighur urged the german leader to press china to allow international investigation of claims that uighurs were involved in several plots to attack the beijing olympic games in august .
relations back to normal after dalai lama visit thomas steg , a deputy spokesman for merkel , told dpa that the chancellor would indeed raise human rights issues during her china visit .
" she 'll bring it up , " he said .
ruprecht polenz , a foreign affairs spokesman for merkel 's party , the christian democratic union , insisted that china-germany relations were back to normal after beijing 's displeasure at merkel meeting in her office last year with the dalai lama .
but polenz , who chairs the parliamentary committee on foreign policy , acknowledged that " human rights remain a problem issue . "
he called on beijing to grant greater autonomy to tibet . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

coinciding with the release , a german university is investigating the trauma of the victims . the movie picks up a story long neglected in german post-war history : the plight of rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii .
" a woman in berlin " premiered at septembers ' film festival in toronto and is being released in theaters across germany on thursday , oct .
23 .
the movie is based on the autobiographical account of marta hiller , a young woman in berlin between the months of april and june in 1945 .
when the book was published anonymously in the 1950s , reactions were overwhelmingly negative .
from flop to bestseller a republished edition hit the shelves only as late as 2003 - - two years after hiller 's death - - and proved to be a bestseller .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their men gone , women were left to pick up the pieces the lead role is portrayed by german actress nina hoss , playing the young woman as soviet soldiers entered berlin in may 1945 .
she 's raped several times by red army soldiers until she eventually enters into a relationship with a russian officer to shield herself from further attacks .
rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii have long been a difficult chapter in german history , especially in communist east germany , where any criticism of the russian army was impossible .
" for the first time the phenomenon of mass rapes at the end of the war is the subject of a german movie , " said jochen-konrad fromme , a german parliamentarian and a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that means that 63 years after the end of the war , the fate and suffering of hundreds of thousands of german women is being acknowledged for the first time , " he added .
millions of victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress nina hoss says her character ' went through hell ' fromme added that historians estimate around 2 million women became victims of rape after the war .
cases of sexual violence also occurred in the western part of germany under the allied forces , yet historians agree that the problem was particularly acute under the soviet army .
coinciding with the release of the movie , the university of greifswald in northeastern germany has launched a research project to study the trauma of women raped during that period .
phillip kuwert , who is heading the project , said that it will help to analyze the long-term psychological effects .
better methods of treatment could then be developed for other conflict or war zones .
german newspapers have reacted with mixed reviews to " a woman in berlin . "
some critics are bashing the filmmakers for treating the serious subject on a level way too trivial and sentimental .
others praise the movie for bringing a chapter of german history to a wider audience which so far many people have been ill-informed about . dw staff -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii have long been a difficult chapter in german history , especially in communist east germany , where any criticism of the russian army was impossible .
" for the first time the phenomenon of mass rapes at the end of the war is the subject of a german movie , " said jochen-konrad fromme , a german parliamentarian and a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that means that 63 years after the end of the war , the fate and suffering of hundreds of thousands of german women is being acknowledged for the first time , " he added .
millions of victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress nina hoss says her character ' went through hell ' fromme added that historians estimate around 2 million women became victims of rape after the war .
cases of sexual violence also occurred in the western part of germany under the allied forces , yet historians agree that the problem was particularly acute under the soviet army .
coinciding with the release of the movie , the university of greifswald in northeastern germany has launched a research project to study the trauma of women raped during that period .
phillip kuwert , who is heading the project , said that it will help to analyze the long-term psychological effects .
better methods of treatment could then be developed for other conflict or war zones .
german newspapers have reacted with mixed reviews to " a woman in berlin . "
some critics are bashing the filmmakers for treating the serious subject on a level way too trivial and sentimental .
others praise the movie for bringing a chapter of german history to a wider audience which so far many people have been ill-informed about . dw staff -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

saying that the scanners " have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens " , the lawmakers voted on a non-binding resolution asking the bloc 's executive european commission to carry out an economic , medical and human rights assessment of the impact of using full-body scanners .

in return , the french state would temporarily buy stakes in the firms . " large french companies ca n't be allowed to fall into foreign hands just because we do n't react to the financial crisis , " sarkozy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says the financial crisis underlines the need for governments to intervene in the economy earlier this week , sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , stirred debate in the european parliament with his plan to partially nationalize key industries with the help of state funds . sarkozy argued that the sovereign wealth fund would help to prevent countries such as china and other gulf nations taking over large european companies by using current stock plunges to buy up shares in eu firms . " i do n't want european citizens to wake up in a few months and discover that european companies belong to non-european capitals , " he said . germany resists plan germany , which last week passed a 500-million-euro rescue package for its troubled banks , reacted sharply to the french proposal on thursday , saying saying any measures must be compatible with european union rules . " the german government believes that ... greater protection measures are not needed in germany , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
" it is also convinced that measures to protect against foreign takeovers must be compatible with -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market rules . " german chancellor angela merkel will discuss sarkozy 's idea with him on the sidelines of a two-day summit of european and asian countries beginning in beijing on friday , wilhelm said in a statement . earlier this week , german economy minister michael glos too dismissed the french plan . " the french proposal that the state should take stakes in european industry so as to protect it from foreign state takeover goes against the successful principles of our economic policy , " glos said . " current state intervention in the banking and insurance sector are an indispensable exception so as to prevent a possible breakdown of financial flows and help protect jobs and growth , " glos said . sarkozy vows more state investment in addition to the sovereign wealth fund , sarkozy unveiled measures to stimulate the french economy . his administration plans to scrap corporate tax on new investments until 2010 and inject 175 billion euros in infrastructure . " in the past 20 years , france has lagged in infrastructure , " sarkozy said , adding that investments were needed in new energies , universities and public transportation .

in return , the french state would temporarily buy stakes in the firms . " large french companies ca n't be allowed to fall into foreign hands just because we do n't react to the financial crisis , " sarkozy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says the financial crisis underlines the need for governments to intervene in the economy earlier this week , sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , stirred debate in the european parliament with his plan to partially nationalize key industries with the help of state funds . sarkozy argued that the sovereign wealth fund would help to prevent countries such as china and other gulf nations taking over large european companies by using current stock plunges to buy up shares in eu firms . " i do n't want european citizens to wake up in a few months and discover that european companies belong to non-european capitals , " he said . germany resists plan germany , which last week passed a 500-million-euro rescue package for its troubled banks , reacted sharply to the french proposal on thursday , saying saying any measures must be compatible with european union rules . " the german government believes that ... greater protection measures are not needed in germany , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
" it is also convinced that measures to protect against foreign takeovers must be compatible with -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market rules . " german chancellor angela merkel will discuss sarkozy 's idea with him on the sidelines of a two-day summit of european and asian countries beginning in beijing on friday , wilhelm said in a statement . earlier this week , german economy minister michael glos too dismissed the french plan . " the french proposal that the state should take stakes in european industry so as to protect it from foreign state takeover goes against the successful principles of our economic policy , " glos said . " current state intervention in the banking and insurance sector are an indispensable exception so as to prevent a possible breakdown of financial flows and help protect jobs and growth , " glos said . sarkozy vows more state investment in addition to the sovereign wealth fund , sarkozy unveiled measures to stimulate the french economy . his administration plans to scrap corporate tax on new investments until 2010 and inject 175 billion euros in infrastructure . " in the past 20 years , france has lagged in infrastructure , " sarkozy said , adding that investments were needed in new energies , universities and public transportation . " governments have to become more active in the economy , " he said .

at least for now .
the little fish , also known as salomon ugborugo , was the head of the ivory coast company , which in 2006 agreed to dispose of 500 tons of liquid waste for the big fish - - otherwise known as dutch multinational firm trafigura . ugborugo 's company did get rid of the waste .
the problem was , they did so without treating it , and the resulting fumes killed an estimated 17 people and have made an estimated 100,000 people in abidjan ill . now , for his role ugborugo is looking at 20 years behind bars .
his partner at the city ’ s port will get 5 years .
ugborugo 's lawyer says he 's appalled by the verdict . " the element of intention was clearly missing .
i would have understood if he was only condemned of involuntary homicide . "
the lawyer insists that his client hadn ’ t been aware that the waste was so dangerous . who is to blame ?
the trail leads to the netherlands it ’ s hard to say how much ugborugo actually knew about the dangerous load his company was dumping . but either way , if you follow the story back up the food chain , it doesn ’ t take long to get back to the netherlands-based trafigura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the clearing efforts , much of the toxic waste is still polluting the area marietta harjono from green peace international , says she hopes the buck doesn ’ t just stop with ugborugo .
" trafigura is a big , multi-billion dollar oil company , " she says .
" the only goal is to make as much money as possible . " trafigura had tried to dispose of the waste in amsterdam , hiding the fact that it was toxic .
but once the truth came out , the tanker full of toxic liquid shipped off to africa , hoping to bypass the hundreds of thousands euros it would have cost to safely treat the material . and that ’ s when the trafigura story merged with ugborugo ’ s . 200 million to avoid a lawsuit when it became clear what had made people sick in abidjan , trafigura paid ivory coast more than $ 200 million to avoid a lawsuit in the west african country .
it seems like a lot , but that amount could be peanuts compared to what the disaster has actually cost ivory coast in terms of health care and environmental clean up costs . with that in mind the netherlands has announced it ’ s suing trafigura for illegal dumping practices and a law firm in england has agreed to bring a suit against the company on behalf of 30,000 plaintiffs affected by the waste in abidjan .
unfortunately for the residents of abidjan , regardless of the outcomes in the courts , the nightmare continues , with much of the toxic waste still polluting the air . eric heath -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the problem was , they did so without treating it , and the resulting fumes killed an estimated 17 people and have made an estimated 100,000 people in abidjan ill . now , for his role ugborugo is looking at 20 years behind bars .
his partner at the city ’ s port will get 5 years .
ugborugo 's lawyer says he 's appalled by the verdict . " the element of intention was clearly missing .
i would have understood if he was only condemned of involuntary homicide . "
the lawyer insists that his client hadn ’ t been aware that the waste was so dangerous . who is to blame ?

" trafigura is a big , multi-billion dollar oil company , " she says .
" the only goal is to make as much money as possible . " trafigura had tried to dispose of the waste in amsterdam , hiding the fact that it was toxic .

economic ties , but also human rights and global warming , were on the meeting agenda , advisers said . at the start of her trip to beijing , merkel spoke of germany 's interest in creating " solid german-chinese economic ties , " and held up the daimler-chinese cooperation as an example .
merkel was at daimler for the celebration of the 25,000th daimler car to roll off the production line in beijing ; she was set to meet chinese premier wen jiabao in the afternoon of thursday , oct .
23 , for talks that are expected to focus on the global financial crisis .
the two leaders will then join some 40 other heads of state at the biannual asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- on friday and saturday .
merkel visit stresses importance of ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel feted the successful automobile cooperation german officials said the fact that merkel was one of the few foreign leaders making a formal state visit to china for the asem summit showed the importance of ties between the two nations .
the world financial crisis , and global warming , are expected to be the main focal points of the asem summit , which groups 27 european and 16 asian nations .
merkel is scheduled to meet president hu jintao on friday .
her talks with chinese leaders will deal with bilateral political and economic ties , as well as north korea 's heavily disputed atomic program , and relations with iran , german politicians told reporters .
moreover , merkel will meet with non-politicians such as journalists and writers .
the trip to china is merkel 's fist since she met with tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama last year , which led to strained ties between beijing and berlin .
calls for discussion on human rights green party politician volker beck told afp news service that he hoped merkel would bring up the " continuing poor state of human rights " in china , and urged her not to let the subject be overshadowed by talks of the financial crisis .
meanwhile , two other human-rights groups appealed to merkel to use the meetings to address human-rights issues , specifically the situation of china 's tibetan and uighur minorities .
merkel should press china for " tangible results from the dialogue between the dalai lama 's representatives and chinese officials , " kate saunders , communications director of the international campaign for tibet , told dpa press agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's 2007 meeting with the dalai lama shook china relations and a european-based group representing china 's mainly muslim uighur urged the german leader to press china to allow international investigation of claims that uighurs were involved in several plots to attack the beijing olympic games in august .
relations back to normal after dalai lama visit thomas steg , a deputy spokesman for merkel , told dpa that the chancellor would indeed raise human rights issues during her china visit .
" she 'll bring it up , " he said .
ruprecht polenz , a foreign affairs spokesman for merkel 's party , the christian democratic union , insisted that china-germany relations were back to normal after beijing 's displeasure at merkel meeting in her office last year with the dalai lama .
but polenz , who chairs the parliamentary committee on foreign policy , acknowledged that " human rights remain a problem issue . "
he called on beijing to grant greater autonomy to tibet . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , several advisors to the french president have confirmed this strategy .

" industry indicators predict weak overall economic activity in the third quarter , which should continue into 2009 , " the report said .
production and orders seemed to be down , generally , the report noted .
the report noted that germany 's crucial export sector is likely to hobble the economy at some point .
growth estimate slashed " immediate consequences of the global crisis on financial markets have been limited so far in germany .
but the crisis will be felt through a slowdown in the global economy , " said the report , which included previously published data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will german cars sell in a recession ?
the report said the " weakness of the global economy has weighed on exports " that contribute significantly to the economy , given that germany is the world 's leading exporter .
the government forecasts annual growth this year of 1.7 percent , owing to an exceptionally dynamic first quarter , but recently slashed its estimate for 2009 to just 0.2 percent .
third-quarter figures are expected in mid-november , but officials have warned gross domestic product would probably be " almost unchanged " from the second quarter , when it contracted by 0.5 percent .
two quarters running of economic contraction are the commonly accepted definition of a recession .
vw predicts carmakers will suffer meanwhile , volkswagen chairman ferdinand piëch told a german newspaper that he expects the german car industry to face a prolonged downturn .

tough times ahead : for the second time in only three months german car giant daimler reduced its expected profit for the next quarter .
the expected annual profit drops from almost 8 down to 6 billion euros . german carmaker daimler ag became the first of the country 's key auto groups to report its third-quarter results , reducing its earnings forecast again in face of deepening economic gloom .
the manufacturer of luxury mercedes-benz vehicles said it now expected to post operating profit in 2008 " of more than 6 billion euros " -lrb- $ 7.67 billion -rrb- .
high energy prices and economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will discounts help to encourage sales ?
daimler chief dieter zetsche had three months previously reduced the group 's 2008 earnings to about 7.0 billion euros from 7.7 billion euros , amid concerns that high energy prices and the prospects of an economic downturn will keep car buyers away from showrooms .
the group 's third-quarter net earnings were 213 million euros , compared with a 1.53-billion-euro loss a year earlier , the company said .
the weak state of the auto business has resulted in analysts expecting the german car sector to begin offering discounts to try to encourage sales .
government aid for the troubled sector ?
germany car industry leaders have also launched a campaign for government aid to help the key export sector to limp through the current financial crisis .
stuttgart-based daimler confirmed last month that it was in talks to finally sever links with troubled us carmaker chrysler , selling off its remaining 19.9-percent stake to the us equity group cerberus capital management lp .
this comes just over a year after cerberus bought an 80.1-percent stake in chrysler from daimler , as the german carmaker moved to end its nine-year troubled relationship with the us vehicle group . dpa news agency -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tough times ahead : for the second time in only three months german car giant daimler reduced its expected profit for the next quarter .
the expected annual profit drops from almost 8 down to 6 billion euros . german carmaker daimler ag became the first of the country 's key auto groups to report its third-quarter results , reducing its earnings forecast again in face of deepening economic gloom .
the manufacturer of luxury mercedes-benz vehicles said it now expected to post operating profit in 2008 " of more than 6 billion euros " -lrb- $ 7.67 billion -rrb- .
high energy prices and economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will discounts help to encourage sales ?
daimler chief dieter zetsche had three months previously reduced the group 's 2008 earnings to about 7.0 billion euros from 7.7 billion euros , amid concerns that high energy prices and the prospects of an economic downturn will keep car buyers away from showrooms .
the group 's third-quarter net earnings were 213 million euros , compared with a 1.53-billion-euro loss a year earlier , the company said .
the weak state of the auto business has resulted in analysts expecting the german car sector to begin offering discounts to try to encourage sales .

but this week 's education summit missed the mark , says dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen . unfortunately , the politicians at the education summit in dresden on wednesday , oct .
22 , did n't present any solutions that fit the problem .
education is often a topic that gets politicians on their soap boxes .
but at the summit , the issue was once again used as a means to boost their political images .
the result was nothing more than expressions of good intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen " education should be top priority in germany , " they concluded .
yes , but was n't it top priority before ?
in dresden , state and federal delegations agreed to halve the number of high school and college dropouts .
that 's been called for many times , but changes have yet to be seen .
the state and federal governments have also said they want to increase the education budget by 10 percent by the year 2015 .
that sounds good - but no one has said how they plan to reach this goal .
money for banks , not for education it 's amazing that it is possible to decide on a billion-euro rescue package for the troubled finance industry in just a few days , but that it is apparently unfeasible to agree on financing germany 's most important resource - education .
what was announced on wednesday was merely symbolic : " look , we 've made it top priority ; we 'll take care of it . "
that sounds good , especially ahead of an election year in the federal parliament as well as several state governments .
after all , a committee was established to figure out how the ambitious goals can be financed .
but there wo n't be any results until after the 2009 bundestag election .
delay instead of action , that 's the motto .
' education for all ' still just a dream once again , the main problems with the german education system were n't addressed .
it 's a disaster that , in a wealthy country like germany , parents ' bank accounts still determine their children 's education options .
former chancellor willy brandt 's appeal in the 1970s for " education for all " has never been fulfilled .
the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school and the working class child goes to the third-tier tech school - that 's still often the case .
children with so-called non-academic backgrounds or from immigrant families are n't challenged enough and their potential goes unrecognized .
germany 's education budget is well below the average of many other industrial countries .
particularly in the elementary schools , much less is invested per child than elsewhere .
germany is the only country in the world that demands several hundred euros a month from young parents so their child can attend pre-school .
education path determined too early furthermore , in no other country does the selection process - the sorting of children into various types of schools - begin so early .
a pupil 's educational path is decided after the fourth grade .
the familiar learning environment , where children learn well and yet differentiated , gets lost . nearly all german education experts agree that the solution is for pupils to spend more time learning together in a positive environment , without pressure to perform .
but in dresden , concrete steps and strategies were n't discussed .
chancellor angela merkel praised wednesday 's resolutions as an important step toward an " education republic of germany . "
but , as one newspaper commented , the " education illusion of germany " would be a more appropriate term .

coinciding with the release , a german university is investigating the trauma of the victims . the movie picks up a story long neglected in german post-war history : the plight of rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii .
" a woman in berlin " premiered at septembers ' film festival in toronto and is being released in theaters across germany on thursday , oct .
23 .
the movie is based on the autobiographical account of marta hiller , a young woman in berlin between the months of april and june in 1945 .
when the book was published anonymously in the 1950s , reactions were overwhelmingly negative .
from flop to bestseller a republished edition hit the shelves only as late as 2003 - - two years after hiller 's death - - and proved to be a bestseller .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their men gone , women were left to pick up the pieces the lead role is portrayed by german actress nina hoss , playing the young woman as soviet soldiers entered berlin in may 1945 .
she 's raped several times by red army soldiers until she eventually enters into a relationship with a russian officer to shield herself from further attacks .
rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii have long been a difficult chapter in german history , especially in communist east germany , where any criticism of the russian army was impossible .
" for the first time the phenomenon of mass rapes at the end of the war is the subject of a german movie , " said jochen-konrad fromme , a german parliamentarian and a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .

in all , the government estimated that german banks had committed between one to five billion euros to investments with lehman brothers . however , spokesmen for the government as well as the insurance companies stressed that the money had not been lost and that it was covered by a fund created by a federation of private german banks . lehman brothers declared bankruptcy on september 15 , the same day that kfw , the german state-owned development bank , transferred more than 300 million euros to it .
that transaction is under investigation .
the government 's letter noted that lehman brothers ' german subsidiary is not officially bankrupt . string of embarrassing financial news but the news is an embarrassing blow to germany , a week after it announced a 500-billion-euro rescue package for its troubled banks and after repeated assurances by lawmakers that its banks were not exposed to the failure of us financial giants . it comes on the heels of a string of damaging revelations at state-owned banks which have been the first to line up to tap the government bailout . on thursday , german news agency dpa cited sources saying michael kemmer , ceo of bavaria 's regional bayern lb bank is to step down following huge losses at the bank , incurred because of its deep involvement he bank in asset-backed securities .
these securities lost much of their value when the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed in 2007 .
as the bank was recovering from this loss , it was hit a second time when interbank loans dried up in mid-september . reports of kemmer 's resignation come just one day after bavarian finance minister and head of bayernlb 's supervisory board erwin huber said he was quitting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumor comes on the heels of the bavarian finance minister 's departure bayernlb became the first german financial house to apply for aid this week when it asked for 5.4 billion euros from berlin 's bank rescue plan . bayernlb also announced wednesday it was launching a review of all its costs , including the the bank 's 19,000 world-wide labor force with the bank having already warned that it might not be able to avoid job cuts .
former ikb execs also feeling the pain but managers at bayern lb are n't the only ones to be feeling the heat of the financial meltdown .
former executives at german bank ikb have been told to pay back bonuses worth millions of euros that they earned before the bank had to be rescued by the government , a spokesman for the bank said thursday .
the bank , which specializes in corporate loans , has told six bankers to return a total of three million euros -lrb- 3.9 million dollars -rrb- , according to agence france presse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six ikb executives have been told to return bonuses " a new assessment of the bank 's accounts for the period 2006-7 has shown the good financial performances that these bonuses were based to be invalid , " the spokesman told afp .
the executives include former chief executive stefan ortseifen who has been told to pay back 805,000 euros -lrb- 1 million dollars -rrb- .
though he quit in july , he is also being sued by the bank over his actions leading up to a government-led rescue earlier this year .
two others have been told that they have until the end of the month to pay back the money , while a third - reportedly still on ikb 's board - has already returned 558,000 euros -lrb- 730,980 dollars -rrb- .
ikb , which had invested heavily in toxic securities linked to subprime mortgages , became the first big casualty of the subprime crisis in germany .
it had to be rescued with several billion euros of public money in july - the same month in which the bonuses were paid out , according to the daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , several advisors to the french president have confirmed this strategy .
sarkozy 's ambition is based on his firm conviction that the crisis in georgia and the financial crisis both demonstrated that europe was in need of a strong leader .
according to le monde , sarkozy believes that without such an individual at the helm , the eu would never have been able to negotiate with moscow or decide on an effective plan to rescue european banks .
in addition , with ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty , there will be no stable presidency of the eu , elected for a period of 30 months , as the treaty had foreseen .
next eu presidencies not in euro zone as a result , the eu will be led by the euro-skeptic czech president vaclav klaus and his prime minister , mirek topolanek , beginning on jan .
1 , 2009 , with the prague government fighting for survival after a landslide defeat in recent regional elections .
in july 2009 , the eu will be headed by sweden , which - like the czechs - does not use the single currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next two eu presidency holders are outside the euro zone to avoid what he foresees as a paralysis in the eu , sarkozy sees the soon-to-be 16-member euro zone as an effective alternative , as it was on oct .
12 , when euro zone leaders formulated the european bank rescue plan at a summit in paris convened by the french president .
in a speech before eu parliamentarians in strasbourg on tuesday , sarkozy said that " a meeting of -lrb- eu -rrb- finance ministers is not up to dealing with the crisis . "
german minister rejects joint economic governance only heads of state and government " have the democratic legitimacy " to decide such wide-ranging measures as the bank rescue plan , he said in strasbourg .
since the eurogroup has no legal existence , a euro zone president could be elected without resorting to a constitution .
or a decision could be taken to allow france - that is , sarkozy - to continue in a leadership position until the eu presidency reverts to a country that uses the euro , which would be spain in january 2010 .
however , it seems unlikely that other eu countries will go along with the idea .
in an interview published wednesday in the french business daily la tribune , german economics minister michael glos said the proposal of a single economic governance of euro zone countries was " not suitable for resolving the current problems . "
the problems of individual eu member nations were diverse , he said , and the majority of economic policies should remain national decisions . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

from flop to bestseller a republished edition hit the shelves only as late as 2003 - - two years after hiller 's death - - and proved to be a bestseller .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their men gone , women were left to pick up the pieces the lead role is portrayed by german actress nina hoss , playing the young woman as soviet soldiers entered berlin in may 1945 .
she 's raped several times by red army soldiers until she eventually enters into a relationship with a russian officer to shield herself from further attacks .
rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii have long been a difficult chapter in german history , especially in communist east germany , where any criticism of the russian army was impossible .
" for the first time the phenomenon of mass rapes at the end of the war is the subject of a german movie , " said jochen-konrad fromme , a german parliamentarian and a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that means that 63 years after the end of the war , the fate and suffering of hundreds of thousands of german women is being acknowledged for the first time , " he added .
millions of victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress nina hoss says her character ' went through hell ' fromme added that historians estimate around 2 million women became victims of rape after the war .
cases of sexual violence also occurred in the western part of germany under the allied forces , yet historians agree that the problem was particularly acute under the soviet army .
coinciding with the release of the movie , the university of greifswald in northeastern germany has launched a research project to study the trauma of women raped during that period .
phillip kuwert , who is heading the project , said that it will help to analyze the long-term psychological effects .
better methods of treatment could then be developed for other conflict or war zones .
german newspapers have reacted with mixed reviews to " a woman in berlin . "
some critics are bashing the filmmakers for treating the serious subject on a level way too trivial and sentimental .
others praise the movie for bringing a chapter of german history to a wider audience which so far many people have been ill-informed about . dw staff -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economic ties , but also human rights and global warming , were on the meeting agenda , advisers said . at the start of her trip to beijing , merkel spoke of germany 's interest in creating " solid german-chinese economic ties , " and held up the daimler-chinese cooperation as an example .
merkel was at daimler for the celebration of the 25,000th daimler car to roll off the production line in beijing ; she was set to meet chinese premier wen jiabao in the afternoon of thursday , oct .

the two leaders will then join some 40 other heads of state at the biannual asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- on friday and saturday .
merkel visit stresses importance of ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel feted the successful automobile cooperation german officials said the fact that merkel was one of the few foreign leaders making a formal state visit to china for the asem summit showed the importance of ties between the two nations .
the world financial crisis , and global warming , are expected to be the main focal points of the asem summit , which groups 27 european and 16 asian nations .
merkel is scheduled to meet president hu jintao on friday .
her talks with chinese leaders will deal with bilateral political and economic ties , as well as north korea 's heavily disputed atomic program , and relations with iran , german politicians told reporters .
moreover , merkel will meet with non-politicians such as journalists and writers .
the trip to china is merkel 's fist since she met with tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama last year , which led to strained ties between beijing and berlin .
calls for discussion on human rights green party politician volker beck told afp news service that he hoped merkel would bring up the " continuing poor state of human rights " in china , and urged her not to let the subject be overshadowed by talks of the financial crisis .
meanwhile , two other human-rights groups appealed to merkel to use the meetings to address human-rights issues , specifically the situation of china 's tibetan and uighur minorities .
merkel should press china for " tangible results from the dialogue between the dalai lama 's representatives and chinese officials , " kate saunders , communications director of the international campaign for tibet , told dpa press agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's 2007 meeting with the dalai lama shook china relations and a european-based group representing china 's mainly muslim uighur urged the german leader to press china to allow international investigation of claims that uighurs were involved in several plots to attack the beijing olympic games in august .

but this week 's education summit missed the mark , says dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen . unfortunately , the politicians at the education summit in dresden on wednesday , oct .
22 , did n't present any solutions that fit the problem .
education is often a topic that gets politicians on their soap boxes .
but at the summit , the issue was once again used as a means to boost their political images .
the result was nothing more than expressions of good intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen " education should be top priority in germany , " they concluded .
yes , but was n't it top priority before ?
in dresden , state and federal delegations agreed to halve the number of high school and college dropouts .
that 's been called for many times , but changes have yet to be seen .
the state and federal governments have also said they want to increase the education budget by 10 percent by the year 2015 .
that sounds good - but no one has said how they plan to reach this goal .
money for banks , not for education it 's amazing that it is possible to decide on a billion-euro rescue package for the troubled finance industry in just a few days , but that it is apparently unfeasible to agree on financing germany 's most important resource - education .
what was announced on wednesday was merely symbolic : " look , we 've made it top priority ; we 'll take care of it . "
that sounds good , especially ahead of an election year in the federal parliament as well as several state governments .
after all , a committee was established to figure out how the ambitious goals can be financed .
but there wo n't be any results until after the 2009 bundestag election .
delay instead of action , that 's the motto .
' education for all ' still just a dream once again , the main problems with the german education system were n't addressed .
it 's a disaster that , in a wealthy country like germany , parents ' bank accounts still determine their children 's education options .
former chancellor willy brandt 's appeal in the 1970s for " education for all " has never been fulfilled .
the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school and the working class child goes to the third-tier tech school - that 's still often the case .
children with so-called non-academic backgrounds or from immigrant families are n't challenged enough and their potential goes unrecognized .
germany 's education budget is well below the average of many other industrial countries .
particularly in the elementary schools , much less is invested per child than elsewhere .
germany is the only country in the world that demands several hundred euros a month from young parents so their child can attend pre-school .
education path determined too early furthermore , in no other country does the selection process - the sorting of children into various types of schools - begin so early .
a pupil 's educational path is decided after the fourth grade .
the familiar learning environment , where children learn well and yet differentiated , gets lost . nearly all german education experts agree that the solution is for pupils to spend more time learning together in a positive environment , without pressure to perform .
but in dresden , concrete steps and strategies were n't discussed .
chancellor angela merkel praised wednesday 's resolutions as an important step toward an " education republic of germany . "
but , as one newspaper commented , the " education illusion of germany " would be a more appropriate term .

economic ties , but also human rights and global warming , were on the meeting agenda , advisers said . at the start of her trip to beijing , merkel spoke of germany 's interest in creating " solid german-chinese economic ties , " and held up the daimler-chinese cooperation as an example .
merkel was at daimler for the celebration of the 25,000th daimler car to roll off the production line in beijing ; she was set to meet chinese premier wen jiabao in the afternoon of thursday , oct .

the world financial crisis , and global warming , are expected to be the main focal points of the asem summit , which groups 27 european and 16 asian nations .
merkel is scheduled to meet president hu jintao on friday .
her talks with chinese leaders will deal with bilateral political and economic ties , as well as north korea 's heavily disputed atomic program , and relations with iran , german politicians told reporters .
moreover , merkel will meet with non-politicians such as journalists and writers .
the trip to china is merkel 's fist since she met with tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama last year , which led to strained ties between beijing and berlin .
calls for discussion on human rights green party politician volker beck told afp news service that he hoped merkel would bring up the " continuing poor state of human rights " in china , and urged her not to let the subject be overshadowed by talks of the financial crisis .
meanwhile , two other human-rights groups appealed to merkel to use the meetings to address human-rights issues , specifically the situation of china 's tibetan and uighur minorities .
merkel should press china for " tangible results from the dialogue between the dalai lama 's representatives and chinese officials , " kate saunders , communications director of the international campaign for tibet , told dpa press agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's 2007 meeting with the dalai lama shook china relations and a european-based group representing china 's mainly muslim uighur urged the german leader to press china to allow international investigation of claims that uighurs were involved in several plots to attack the beijing olympic games in august .

saying that the scanners " have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens " , the lawmakers voted on a non-binding resolution asking the bloc 's executive european commission to carry out an economic , medical and human rights assessment of the impact of using full-body scanners .
body scanners use radio waves to display full-body images that reveal whether passengers are concealing weapons or explosives under their clothes .
the commission proposed last month that the scanners be added to a list of security measures that can be used at airports in the 27-country bloc .
the eu commission says the proposal is meant to harmonize the conditions in which they can be operated .
the scanners are already in use at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports to speed up security checks and to avoid hand-frisking passengers .
" a serious breach of fundamental rights " while the european parliament resolution does not call for an outright ban on such scanners , some eu lawmakers said they found them unacceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner is touted as a faster alternative to body searches " i think this is an offense against human dignity .
using this technology does not make us safer , " said the leader of the assembly 's socialist group , martin schulz .

he said the idea was proof of the " paranoia of interior ministers " when it comes to the question of fighting terrorism .
green mep eva lichtenberger said the machines could be a " serious breach of fundamental rights and the defense of human dignity .
it seems that there is no real effort to see whether they really increase security . "

" the body will indeed be pictured , " he said .
" but the quality is more that of a negative of a photograph , it is not a very clear image but sufficient to detect metal things , explosives or strange objects . "
ahead of the debate , eu transport commissioner antonio tajani likewise insisted that people would not be forced to go through them .
" the body scanner will never be made obligatory .
it 's an alternative to hand searches , " he said , adding that the images " would not be recorded and never stored " on a database .

but this week 's education summit missed the mark , says dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen . unfortunately , the politicians at the education summit in dresden on wednesday , oct .
22 , did n't present any solutions that fit the problem .
education is often a topic that gets politicians on their soap boxes .
but at the summit , the issue was once again used as a means to boost their political images .
the result was nothing more than expressions of good intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen " education should be top priority in germany , " they concluded .
yes , but was n't it top priority before ?
in dresden , state and federal delegations agreed to halve the number of high school and college dropouts .
that 's been called for many times , but changes have yet to be seen .
the state and federal governments have also said they want to increase the education budget by 10 percent by the year 2015 .
that sounds good - but no one has said how they plan to reach this goal .
money for banks , not for education it 's amazing that it is possible to decide on a billion-euro rescue package for the troubled finance industry in just a few days , but that it is apparently unfeasible to agree on financing germany 's most important resource - education .
what was announced on wednesday was merely symbolic : " look , we 've made it top priority ; we 'll take care of it . "
that sounds good , especially ahead of an election year in the federal parliament as well as several state governments .
after all , a committee was established to figure out how the ambitious goals can be financed .
but there wo n't be any results until after the 2009 bundestag election .
delay instead of action , that 's the motto .
' education for all ' still just a dream once again , the main problems with the german education system were n't addressed .
it 's a disaster that , in a wealthy country like germany , parents ' bank accounts still determine their children 's education options .
former chancellor willy brandt 's appeal in the 1970s for " education for all " has never been fulfilled .
the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school and the working class child goes to the third-tier tech school - that 's still often the case .
children with so-called non-academic backgrounds or from immigrant families are n't challenged enough and their potential goes unrecognized .
germany 's education budget is well below the average of many other industrial countries .
particularly in the elementary schools , much less is invested per child than elsewhere .
germany is the only country in the world that demands several hundred euros a month from young parents so their child can attend pre-school .
education path determined too early furthermore , in no other country does the selection process - the sorting of children into various types of schools - begin so early .
a pupil 's educational path is decided after the fourth grade .
the familiar learning environment , where children learn well and yet differentiated , gets lost . nearly all german education experts agree that the solution is for pupils to spend more time learning together in a positive environment , without pressure to perform .
but in dresden , concrete steps and strategies were n't discussed .
chancellor angela merkel praised wednesday 's resolutions as an important step toward an " education republic of germany . "
but , as one newspaper commented , the " education illusion of germany " would be a more appropriate term .

in return , the french state would temporarily buy stakes in the firms . " large french companies ca n't be allowed to fall into foreign hands just because we do n't react to the financial crisis , " sarkozy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says the financial crisis underlines the need for governments to intervene in the economy earlier this week , sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , stirred debate in the european parliament with his plan to partially nationalize key industries with the help of state funds . sarkozy argued that the sovereign wealth fund would help to prevent countries such as china and other gulf nations taking over large european companies by using current stock plunges to buy up shares in eu firms . " i do n't want european citizens to wake up in a few months and discover that european companies belong to non-european capitals , " he said . germany resists plan germany , which last week passed a 500-million-euro rescue package for its troubled banks , reacted sharply to the french proposal on thursday , saying saying any measures must be compatible with european union rules . " the german government believes that ... greater protection measures are not needed in germany , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
" it is also convinced that measures to protect against foreign takeovers must be compatible with -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market rules . " german chancellor angela merkel will discuss sarkozy 's idea with him on the sidelines of a two-day summit of european and asian countries beginning in beijing on friday , wilhelm said in a statement . earlier this week , german economy minister michael glos too dismissed the french plan . " the french proposal that the state should take stakes in european industry so as to protect it from foreign state takeover goes against the successful principles of our economic policy , " glos said . " current state intervention in the banking and insurance sector are an indispensable exception so as to prevent a possible breakdown of financial flows and help protect jobs and growth , " glos said . sarkozy vows more state investment in addition to the sovereign wealth fund , sarkozy unveiled measures to stimulate the french economy . his administration plans to scrap corporate tax on new investments until 2010 and inject 175 billion euros in infrastructure . " in the past 20 years , france has lagged in infrastructure , " sarkozy said , adding that investments were needed in new energies , universities and public transportation .

23 , for defending the rights of people living with hiv / aids . " awarding the sakharov to hu jia is a reflection of the very spirit of this prize , which supports free thought and honors human rights defenders fighting repression , " greens leaders daniel cohn-bendit and monica frassoni said in a statement . hu is currently serving a three-and-a-half-year jail term on charges of subversion .
beijing on thursday insisted that hu is a criminal . " to issue an award to such a criminal amounts to interference in china 's judicial sovereignty and is totally against the purpose of this prize , " said government spokesman qin gang . the sakharov award announcement comes just one day ahead of an asia-europe summit , but qin declined to say whether hu 's recognition would have a negative impact on the talks . uncovering a ' state secret ' hu 's activism began in the late 1990s when the economics graduate volunteered to work on environmental projects . in 2001 , he began helping villagers infected with hiv / aids through blood-selling schemes in the central province of henan .
the following year , hu and four friends had their first run-in with state security police who intercepted them and seized film after they traveled to henan villages . the group took christmas toys and clothes to children in poor villages that were decimated due to aids spread by the illegal collection and sale of blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hu said the sars epidemic helped draw awareness to the aids problem in china " it seemed like the worst scenes of aids in africa , with old and young people infected , " hu told dpa news agency .
" state security police threatened us and said that aids was a state secret , " he said . hu said he believes that china was " lucky " to be shaken out of its complacency on aids by the scandal over a cover-up of hundreds of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- in beijing . " after sars in 2003 , nobody dared to say that aids was a state secret any more , " hu said .
" it gave us an opportunity to be more open . " activism despite house arrest his continued advocacy for the rights of people living with hiv / aids in china brought him international attention and several awards . but after two years of relatively open activism , the climate began to change with the arrest and harassment of aids activists in 2005 , he said . in 2006 and 2007 he was forced to spend most of his time confined inside his suburban apartment on the outskirts of beijing .
before his formal arrest in late december , hu had spent most of the previous two years under virtual house arrest or other forms of detention . he used his enforced isolation to act as a bridge between foreign media and the growing number of rights activists across the country , collecting and disseminating information on rights cases and other issues in china via the internet and telephone . in november , he and his wife zeng jinyan managed to testify in a telephone call to the european parliamentary hearing on the rights situation in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nelson mandela was the first recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize in 1988 despite appeals from the european union , the united states and rights groups for his release , a beijing court in april sentenced hu to three and a half years in prison for " inciting subversion of state power " after a one-day trial . the sakharov prize , in its 20th year , is named for the soviet dissident andrei sakharov , who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1975 .

saying that the scanners " have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens " , the lawmakers voted on a non-binding resolution asking the bloc 's executive european commission to carry out an economic , medical and human rights assessment of the impact of using full-body scanners .
body scanners use radio waves to display full-body images that reveal whether passengers are concealing weapons or explosives under their clothes .
the commission proposed last month that the scanners be added to a list of security measures that can be used at airports in the 27-country bloc .
the eu commission says the proposal is meant to harmonize the conditions in which they can be operated .
the scanners are already in use at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports to speed up security checks and to avoid hand-frisking passengers .
" a serious breach of fundamental rights " while the european parliament resolution does not call for an outright ban on such scanners , some eu lawmakers said they found them unacceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner is touted as a faster alternative to body searches " i think this is an offense against human dignity .
using this technology does not make us safer , " said the leader of the assembly 's socialist group , martin schulz .
" these devices allow one to see genitals , if a woman has big or small breasts , " said german social democrat lawmaker wolfgang kreissl-doerfler , during debate on the topic .
he said the idea was proof of the " paranoia of interior ministers " when it comes to the question of fighting terrorism .
green mep eva lichtenberger said the machines could be a " serious breach of fundamental rights and the defense of human dignity .
it seems that there is no real effort to see whether they really increase security . "
a voluntary way to speed up security screening european commission spokesman jens mester disagreed , however , saying that fears concerning the eu executive 's proposal were exaggerated .
" the body will indeed be pictured , " he said .
" but the quality is more that of a negative of a photograph , it is not a very clear image but sufficient to detect metal things , explosives or strange objects . "
ahead of the debate , eu transport commissioner antonio tajani likewise insisted that people would not be forced to go through them .
" the body scanner will never be made obligatory .
it 's an alternative to hand searches , " he said , adding that the images " would not be recorded and never stored " on a database .
he said the machines could help shorten security lines at airports , and that personally he found body searches to be more invasive than the machines .
" but everyone is free to choose , " he said . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tough times ahead : for the second time in only three months german car giant daimler reduced its expected profit for the next quarter .
the expected annual profit drops from almost 8 down to 6 billion euros . german carmaker daimler ag became the first of the country 's key auto groups to report its third-quarter results , reducing its earnings forecast again in face of deepening economic gloom .
the manufacturer of luxury mercedes-benz vehicles said it now expected to post operating profit in 2008 " of more than 6 billion euros " -lrb- $ 7.67 billion -rrb- .
high energy prices and economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will discounts help to encourage sales ?
daimler chief dieter zetsche had three months previously reduced the group 's 2008 earnings to about 7.0 billion euros from 7.7 billion euros , amid concerns that high energy prices and the prospects of an economic downturn will keep car buyers away from showrooms .
the group 's third-quarter net earnings were 213 million euros , compared with a 1.53-billion-euro loss a year earlier , the company said .
the weak state of the auto business has resulted in analysts expecting the german car sector to begin offering discounts to try to encourage sales .
government aid for the troubled sector ?
germany car industry leaders have also launched a campaign for government aid to help the key export sector to limp through the current financial crisis .
stuttgart-based daimler confirmed last month that it was in talks to finally sever links with troubled us carmaker chrysler , selling off its remaining 19.9-percent stake to the us equity group cerberus capital management lp .
this comes just over a year after cerberus bought an 80.1-percent stake in chrysler from daimler , as the german carmaker moved to end its nine-year troubled relationship with the us vehicle group . dpa news agency -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this week 's education summit missed the mark , says dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen . unfortunately , the politicians at the education summit in dresden on wednesday , oct .
22 , did n't present any solutions that fit the problem .
education is often a topic that gets politicians on their soap boxes .
but at the summit , the issue was once again used as a means to boost their political images .
the result was nothing more than expressions of good intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen " education should be top priority in germany , " they concluded .
yes , but was n't it top priority before ?
in dresden , state and federal delegations agreed to halve the number of high school and college dropouts .
that 's been called for many times , but changes have yet to be seen .
the state and federal governments have also said they want to increase the education budget by 10 percent by the year 2015 .
that sounds good - but no one has said how they plan to reach this goal .
money for banks , not for education it 's amazing that it is possible to decide on a billion-euro rescue package for the troubled finance industry in just a few days , but that it is apparently unfeasible to agree on financing germany 's most important resource - education .
what was announced on wednesday was merely symbolic : " look , we 've made it top priority ; we 'll take care of it . "
that sounds good , especially ahead of an election year in the federal parliament as well as several state governments .
after all , a committee was established to figure out how the ambitious goals can be financed .
but there wo n't be any results until after the 2009 bundestag election .

but this week 's education summit missed the mark , says dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen . unfortunately , the politicians at the education summit in dresden on wednesday , oct .
22 , did n't present any solutions that fit the problem .
education is often a topic that gets politicians on their soap boxes .
but at the summit , the issue was once again used as a means to boost their political images .
the result was nothing more than expressions of good intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen " education should be top priority in germany , " they concluded .
yes , but was n't it top priority before ?
in dresden , state and federal delegations agreed to halve the number of high school and college dropouts .
that 's been called for many times , but changes have yet to be seen .
the state and federal governments have also said they want to increase the education budget by 10 percent by the year 2015 .
that sounds good - but no one has said how they plan to reach this goal .
money for banks , not for education it 's amazing that it is possible to decide on a billion-euro rescue package for the troubled finance industry in just a few days , but that it is apparently unfeasible to agree on financing germany 's most important resource - education .
what was announced on wednesday was merely symbolic : " look , we 've made it top priority ; we 'll take care of it . "
that sounds good , especially ahead of an election year in the federal parliament as well as several state governments .
after all , a committee was established to figure out how the ambitious goals can be financed .
but there wo n't be any results until after the 2009 bundestag election .
delay instead of action , that 's the motto .
' education for all ' still just a dream once again , the main problems with the german education system were n't addressed .
it 's a disaster that , in a wealthy country like germany , parents ' bank accounts still determine their children 's education options .

tough times ahead : for the second time in only three months german car giant daimler reduced its expected profit for the next quarter .
the expected annual profit drops from almost 8 down to 6 billion euros . german carmaker daimler ag became the first of the country 's key auto groups to report its third-quarter results , reducing its earnings forecast again in face of deepening economic gloom .
the manufacturer of luxury mercedes-benz vehicles said it now expected to post operating profit in 2008 " of more than 6 billion euros " -lrb- $ 7.67 billion -rrb- .
high energy prices and economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will discounts help to encourage sales ?
daimler chief dieter zetsche had three months previously reduced the group 's 2008 earnings to about 7.0 billion euros from 7.7 billion euros , amid concerns that high energy prices and the prospects of an economic downturn will keep car buyers away from showrooms .
the group 's third-quarter net earnings were 213 million euros , compared with a 1.53-billion-euro loss a year earlier , the company said .
the weak state of the auto business has resulted in analysts expecting the german car sector to begin offering discounts to try to encourage sales .
government aid for the troubled sector ?
germany car industry leaders have also launched a campaign for government aid to help the key export sector to limp through the current financial crisis .
stuttgart-based daimler confirmed last month that it was in talks to finally sever links with troubled us carmaker chrysler , selling off its remaining 19.9-percent stake to the us equity group cerberus capital management lp .
this comes just over a year after cerberus bought an 80.1-percent stake in chrysler from daimler , as the german carmaker moved to end its nine-year troubled relationship with the us vehicle group . dpa news agency -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government has always called for the release of hu jia and will continue to do so , " she said , adding that she did n't expect the issue to cast a cloud over the asem summit .

daimler chief dieter zetsche had three months previously reduced the group 's 2008 earnings to about 7.0 billion euros from 7.7 billion euros , amid concerns that high energy prices and the prospects of an economic downturn will keep car buyers away from showrooms .
the group 's third-quarter net earnings were 213 million euros , compared with a 1.53-billion-euro loss a year earlier , the company said .

saying that the scanners " have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens " , the lawmakers voted on a non-binding resolution asking the bloc 's executive european commission to carry out an economic , medical and human rights assessment of the impact of using full-body scanners .
body scanners use radio waves to display full-body images that reveal whether passengers are concealing weapons or explosives under their clothes .
the commission proposed last month that the scanners be added to a list of security measures that can be used at airports in the 27-country bloc .
the eu commission says the proposal is meant to harmonize the conditions in which they can be operated .
the scanners are already in use at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports to speed up security checks and to avoid hand-frisking passengers .

saying that the scanners " have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens " , the lawmakers voted on a non-binding resolution asking the bloc 's executive european commission to carry out an economic , medical and human rights assessment of the impact of using full-body scanners .
body scanners use radio waves to display full-body images that reveal whether passengers are concealing weapons or explosives under their clothes .
the commission proposed last month that the scanners be added to a list of security measures that can be used at airports in the 27-country bloc .
the eu commission says the proposal is meant to harmonize the conditions in which they can be operated .
the scanners are already in use at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports to speed up security checks and to avoid hand-frisking passengers .
" a serious breach of fundamental rights " while the european parliament resolution does not call for an outright ban on such scanners , some eu lawmakers said they found them unacceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner is touted as a faster alternative to body searches " i think this is an offense against human dignity .
using this technology does not make us safer , " said the leader of the assembly 's socialist group , martin schulz .
" these devices allow one to see genitals , if a woman has big or small breasts , " said german social democrat lawmaker wolfgang kreissl-doerfler , during debate on the topic .
he said the idea was proof of the " paranoia of interior ministers " when it comes to the question of fighting terrorism .
green mep eva lichtenberger said the machines could be a " serious breach of fundamental rights and the defense of human dignity .
it seems that there is no real effort to see whether they really increase security . "
a voluntary way to speed up security screening european commission spokesman jens mester disagreed , however , saying that fears concerning the eu executive 's proposal were exaggerated .
" the body will indeed be pictured , " he said .
" but the quality is more that of a negative of a photograph , it is not a very clear image but sufficient to detect metal things , explosives or strange objects . "
ahead of the debate , eu transport commissioner antonio tajani likewise insisted that people would not be forced to go through them .
" the body scanner will never be made obligatory .
it 's an alternative to hand searches , " he said , adding that the images " would not be recorded and never stored " on a database .
he said the machines could help shorten security lines at airports , and that personally he found body searches to be more invasive than the machines .
" but everyone is free to choose , " he said . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in all , the government estimated that german banks had committed between one to five billion euros to investments with lehman brothers . however , spokesmen for the government as well as the insurance companies stressed that the money had not been lost and that it was covered by a fund created by a federation of private german banks . lehman brothers declared bankruptcy on september 15 , the same day that kfw , the german state-owned development bank , transferred more than 300 million euros to it .
that transaction is under investigation .

these securities lost much of their value when the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed in 2007 .
as the bank was recovering from this loss , it was hit a second time when interbank loans dried up in mid-september . reports of kemmer 's resignation come just one day after bavarian finance minister and head of bayernlb 's supervisory board erwin huber said he was quitting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumor comes on the heels of the bavarian finance minister 's departure bayernlb became the first german financial house to apply for aid this week when it asked for 5.4 billion euros from berlin 's bank rescue plan . bayernlb also announced wednesday it was launching a review of all its costs , including the the bank 's 19,000 world-wide labor force with the bank having already warned that it might not be able to avoid job cuts .
former ikb execs also feeling the pain but managers at bayern lb are n't the only ones to be feeling the heat of the financial meltdown .
former executives at german bank ikb have been told to pay back bonuses worth millions of euros that they earned before the bank had to be rescued by the government , a spokesman for the bank said thursday .
the bank , which specializes in corporate loans , has told six bankers to return a total of three million euros -lrb- 3.9 million dollars -rrb- , according to agence france presse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six ikb executives have been told to return bonuses " a new assessment of the bank 's accounts for the period 2006-7 has shown the good financial performances that these bonuses were based to be invalid , " the spokesman told afp .
the executives include former chief executive stefan ortseifen who has been told to pay back 805,000 euros -lrb- 1 million dollars -rrb- .
though he quit in july , he is also being sued by the bank over his actions leading up to a government-led rescue earlier this year .
two others have been told that they have until the end of the month to pay back the money , while a third - reportedly still on ikb 's board - has already returned 558,000 euros -lrb- 730,980 dollars -rrb- .
ikb , which had invested heavily in toxic securities linked to subprime mortgages , became the first big casualty of the subprime crisis in germany .

former ikb execs also feeling the pain but managers at bayern lb are n't the only ones to be feeling the heat of the financial meltdown .
former executives at german bank ikb have been told to pay back bonuses worth millions of euros that they earned before the bank had to be rescued by the government , a spokesman for the bank said thursday .
the bank , which specializes in corporate loans , has told six bankers to return a total of three million euros -lrb- 3.9 million dollars -rrb- , according to agence france presse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six ikb executives have been told to return bonuses " a new assessment of the bank 's accounts for the period 2006-7 has shown the good financial performances that these bonuses were based to be invalid , " the spokesman told afp .
the executives include former chief executive stefan ortseifen who has been told to pay back 805,000 euros -lrb- 1 million dollars -rrb- .
though he quit in july , he is also being sued by the bank over his actions leading up to a government-led rescue earlier this year .
two others have been told that they have until the end of the month to pay back the money , while a third - reportedly still on ikb 's board - has already returned 558,000 euros -lrb- 730,980 dollars -rrb- .
ikb , which had invested heavily in toxic securities linked to subprime mortgages , became the first big casualty of the subprime crisis in germany .

23 , for defending the rights of people living with hiv / aids . " awarding the sakharov to hu jia is a reflection of the very spirit of this prize , which supports free thought and honors human rights defenders fighting repression , " greens leaders daniel cohn-bendit and monica frassoni said in a statement . hu is currently serving a three-and-a-half-year jail term on charges of subversion .
beijing on thursday insisted that hu is a criminal . " to issue an award to such a criminal amounts to interference in china 's judicial sovereignty and is totally against the purpose of this prize , " said government spokesman qin gang . the sakharov award announcement comes just one day ahead of an asia-europe summit , but qin declined to say whether hu 's recognition would have a negative impact on the talks . uncovering a ' state secret ' hu 's activism began in the late 1990s when the economics graduate volunteered to work on environmental projects . in 2001 , he began helping villagers infected with hiv / aids through blood-selling schemes in the central province of henan .
the following year , hu and four friends had their first run-in with state security police who intercepted them and seized film after they traveled to henan villages . the group took christmas toys and clothes to children in poor villages that were decimated due to aids spread by the illegal collection and sale of blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hu said the sars epidemic helped draw awareness to the aids problem in china " it seemed like the worst scenes of aids in africa , with old and young people infected , " hu told dpa news agency .
" state security police threatened us and said that aids was a state secret , " he said . hu said he believes that china was " lucky " to be shaken out of its complacency on aids by the scandal over a cover-up of hundreds of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- in beijing . " after sars in 2003 , nobody dared to say that aids was a state secret any more , " hu said .
" it gave us an opportunity to be more open . " activism despite house arrest his continued advocacy for the rights of people living with hiv / aids in china brought him international attention and several awards . but after two years of relatively open activism , the climate began to change with the arrest and harassment of aids activists in 2005 , he said . in 2006 and 2007 he was forced to spend most of his time confined inside his suburban apartment on the outskirts of beijing .
before his formal arrest in late december , hu had spent most of the previous two years under virtual house arrest or other forms of detention . he used his enforced isolation to act as a bridge between foreign media and the growing number of rights activists across the country , collecting and disseminating information on rights cases and other issues in china via the internet and telephone . in november , he and his wife zeng jinyan managed to testify in a telephone call to the european parliamentary hearing on the rights situation in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nelson mandela was the first recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize in 1988 despite appeals from the european union , the united states and rights groups for his release , a beijing court in april sentenced hu to three and a half years in prison for " inciting subversion of state power " after a one-day trial . the sakharov prize , in its 20th year , is named for the soviet dissident andrei sakharov , who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1975 .

22 , several advisors to the french president have confirmed this strategy .
sarkozy 's ambition is based on his firm conviction that the crisis in georgia and the financial crisis both demonstrated that europe was in need of a strong leader .
according to le monde , sarkozy believes that without such an individual at the helm , the eu would never have been able to negotiate with moscow or decide on an effective plan to rescue european banks .
in addition , with ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty , there will be no stable presidency of the eu , elected for a period of 30 months , as the treaty had foreseen .

in all , the government estimated that german banks had committed between one to five billion euros to investments with lehman brothers . however , spokesmen for the government as well as the insurance companies stressed that the money had not been lost and that it was covered by a fund created by a federation of private german banks . lehman brothers declared bankruptcy on september 15 , the same day that kfw , the german state-owned development bank , transferred more than 300 million euros to it .
that transaction is under investigation .

former executives at german bank ikb have been told to pay back bonuses worth millions of euros that they earned before the bank had to be rescued by the government , a spokesman for the bank said thursday .
the bank , which specializes in corporate loans , has told six bankers to return a total of three million euros -lrb- 3.9 million dollars -rrb- , according to agence france presse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six ikb executives have been told to return bonuses " a new assessment of the bank 's accounts for the period 2006-7 has shown the good financial performances that these bonuses were based to be invalid , " the spokesman told afp .
the executives include former chief executive stefan ortseifen who has been told to pay back 805,000 euros -lrb- 1 million dollars -rrb- .
though he quit in july , he is also being sued by the bank over his actions leading up to a government-led rescue earlier this year .
two others have been told that they have until the end of the month to pay back the money , while a third - reportedly still on ikb 's board - has already returned 558,000 euros -lrb- 730,980 dollars -rrb- .
ikb , which had invested heavily in toxic securities linked to subprime mortgages , became the first big casualty of the subprime crisis in germany .

23 , for defending the rights of people living with hiv / aids . " awarding the sakharov to hu jia is a reflection of the very spirit of this prize , which supports free thought and honors human rights defenders fighting repression , " greens leaders daniel cohn-bendit and monica frassoni said in a statement . hu is currently serving a three-and-a-half-year jail term on charges of subversion .
beijing on thursday insisted that hu is a criminal . " to issue an award to such a criminal amounts to interference in china 's judicial sovereignty and is totally against the purpose of this prize , " said government spokesman qin gang . the sakharov award announcement comes just one day ahead of an asia-europe summit , but qin declined to say whether hu 's recognition would have a negative impact on the talks . uncovering a ' state secret ' hu 's activism began in the late 1990s when the economics graduate volunteered to work on environmental projects . in 2001 , he began helping villagers infected with hiv / aids through blood-selling schemes in the central province of henan .
the following year , hu and four friends had their first run-in with state security police who intercepted them and seized film after they traveled to henan villages . the group took christmas toys and clothes to children in poor villages that were decimated due to aids spread by the illegal collection and sale of blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hu said the sars epidemic helped draw awareness to the aids problem in china " it seemed like the worst scenes of aids in africa , with old and young people infected , " hu told dpa news agency .
" state security police threatened us and said that aids was a state secret , " he said . hu said he believes that china was " lucky " to be shaken out of its complacency on aids by the scandal over a cover-up of hundreds of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- in beijing .

" awarding the sakharov to hu jia is a reflection of the very spirit of this prize , which supports free thought and honors human rights defenders fighting repression , " greens leaders daniel cohn-bendit and monica frassoni said in a statement . hu is currently serving a three-and-a-half-year jail term on charges of subversion .
beijing on thursday insisted that hu is a criminal .

economic ties , but also human rights and global warming , were on the meeting agenda , advisers said . at the start of her trip to beijing , merkel spoke of germany 's interest in creating " solid german-chinese economic ties , " and held up the daimler-chinese cooperation as an example .
merkel was at daimler for the celebration of the 25,000th daimler car to roll off the production line in beijing ; she was set to meet chinese premier wen jiabao in the afternoon of thursday , oct .
23 , for talks that are expected to focus on the global financial crisis .
the two leaders will then join some 40 other heads of state at the biannual asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- on friday and saturday .
merkel visit stresses importance of ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel feted the successful automobile cooperation german officials said the fact that merkel was one of the few foreign leaders making a formal state visit to china for the asem summit showed the importance of ties between the two nations .
the world financial crisis , and global warming , are expected to be the main focal points of the asem summit , which groups 27 european and 16 asian nations .
merkel is scheduled to meet president hu jintao on friday .
her talks with chinese leaders will deal with bilateral political and economic ties , as well as north korea 's heavily disputed atomic program , and relations with iran , german politicians told reporters .
moreover , merkel will meet with non-politicians such as journalists and writers .
the trip to china is merkel 's fist since she met with tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama last year , which led to strained ties between beijing and berlin .
calls for discussion on human rights green party politician volker beck told afp news service that he hoped merkel would bring up the " continuing poor state of human rights " in china , and urged her not to let the subject be overshadowed by talks of the financial crisis .
meanwhile , two other human-rights groups appealed to merkel to use the meetings to address human-rights issues , specifically the situation of china 's tibetan and uighur minorities .
merkel should press china for " tangible results from the dialogue between the dalai lama 's representatives and chinese officials , " kate saunders , communications director of the international campaign for tibet , told dpa press agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's 2007 meeting with the dalai lama shook china relations and a european-based group representing china 's mainly muslim uighur urged the german leader to press china to allow international investigation of claims that uighurs were involved in several plots to attack the beijing olympic games in august .
relations back to normal after dalai lama visit thomas steg , a deputy spokesman for merkel , told dpa that the chancellor would indeed raise human rights issues during her china visit .
" she 'll bring it up , " he said .
ruprecht polenz , a foreign affairs spokesman for merkel 's party , the christian democratic union , insisted that china-germany relations were back to normal after beijing 's displeasure at merkel meeting in her office last year with the dalai lama .
but polenz , who chairs the parliamentary committee on foreign policy , acknowledged that " human rights remain a problem issue . "
he called on beijing to grant greater autonomy to tibet . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.10.2008 two jailed in ivory coast in dutch toxic dumping scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ivorian man in an oxygen mask in abijhan where toxic waste was dumped a court in ivory coast jailed two people over a deadly 2006 dumping of toxic waste which killed at least 17 people and poisoned thousands after a dutch firm paid an african company to dispose 500 tons of toxic liquid . it 's a case of catching the little fish while watching the big fish wriggle away .
at least for now .
the little fish , also known as salomon ugborugo , was the head of the ivory coast company , which in 2006 agreed to dispose of 500 tons of liquid waste for the big fish - - otherwise known as dutch multinational firm trafigura . ugborugo 's company did get rid of the waste .
the problem was , they did so without treating it , and the resulting fumes killed an estimated 17 people and have made an estimated 100,000 people in abidjan ill . now , for his role ugborugo is looking at 20 years behind bars .
his partner at the city ’ s port will get 5 years .
ugborugo 's lawyer says he 's appalled by the verdict . " the element of intention was clearly missing .
i would have understood if he was only condemned of involuntary homicide . "
the lawyer insists that his client hadn ’ t been aware that the waste was so dangerous . who is to blame ?
the trail leads to the netherlands it ’ s hard to say how much ugborugo actually knew about the dangerous load his company was dumping . but either way , if you follow the story back up the food chain , it doesn ’ t take long to get back to the netherlands-based trafigura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the clearing efforts , much of the toxic waste is still polluting the area marietta harjono from green peace international , says she hopes the buck doesn ’ t just stop with ugborugo .
" trafigura is a big , multi-billion dollar oil company , " she says .
" the only goal is to make as much money as possible . " trafigura had tried to dispose of the waste in amsterdam , hiding the fact that it was toxic .
but once the truth came out , the tanker full of toxic liquid shipped off to africa , hoping to bypass the hundreds of thousands euros it would have cost to safely treat the material . and that ’ s when the trafigura story merged with ugborugo ’ s . 200 million to avoid a lawsuit when it became clear what had made people sick in abidjan , trafigura paid ivory coast more than $ 200 million to avoid a lawsuit in the west african country .
it seems like a lot , but that amount could be peanuts compared to what the disaster has actually cost ivory coast in terms of health care and environmental clean up costs . with that in mind the netherlands has announced it ’ s suing trafigura for illegal dumping practices and a law firm in england has agreed to bring a suit against the company on behalf of 30,000 plaintiffs affected by the waste in abidjan .
unfortunately for the residents of abidjan , regardless of the outcomes in the courts , the nightmare continues , with much of the toxic waste still polluting the air . eric heath -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it provides information about the fate of jews in national-socialist germany , their place of birth , their place of residence and about whether and when they left germany or when they were murdered , " franka kuehn , spokeswoman for the german foundation for remembrance , responsibility and future , which initiated the research project , told deutsche welle .
on thursday , oct .
23 , german culture minister bernd neumann and martin salm , the head of the foundation , officially lodged the list at yad vashem .
though the israeli memorial site has a huge database of its own , the german contribution is a valuable addition because it is based on over 1,000 sources - more than ever used at one time .
long-drawn out process kuehn said that several terminology issues had to be sorted out during the research process , as it was n't always clear who was a jew and who was n't .
the nazis ' own records of jews contained people who may have only sympathized with the jews and were therefore also persecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many holocaust victims were transported to death camps by train " the term jew had a racist connotation during the time of national socialism , " said kuehn .
one might ask whether golo mann -lrb- son of german writer thomas mann -rrb- would have wanted to see his name on a list of german jews , but it 's not our job as a foundation to answer these kinds of questions . "
the study follows a 1986 compilation , revised in 2005 , of the names of the 150,000 german jews killed in the holocaust .
a greater number of german jews managed to flee .
the nazis killed an estimated 6 million jews in europe .
the german foundation for remembrance , responsibility and future was founded in 2002 to organize compensation payments to forced laborers under the nazi regime .
by the end of 2007 , the foundation had disbursed 4.37 billion euros from german industries and the state to more than 1.5 million people in 98 countries . dw staff -lrb- hg / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tough times ahead : for the second time in only three months german car giant daimler reduced its expected profit for the next quarter .
the expected annual profit drops from almost 8 down to 6 billion euros . german carmaker daimler ag became the first of the country 's key auto groups to report its third-quarter results , reducing its earnings forecast again in face of deepening economic gloom .
the manufacturer of luxury mercedes-benz vehicles said it now expected to post operating profit in 2008 " of more than 6 billion euros " -lrb- $ 7.67 billion -rrb- .
high energy prices and economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will discounts help to encourage sales ?
daimler chief dieter zetsche had three months previously reduced the group 's 2008 earnings to about 7.0 billion euros from 7.7 billion euros , amid concerns that high energy prices and the prospects of an economic downturn will keep car buyers away from showrooms .
the group 's third-quarter net earnings were 213 million euros , compared with a 1.53-billion-euro loss a year earlier , the company said .
the weak state of the auto business has resulted in analysts expecting the german car sector to begin offering discounts to try to encourage sales .
government aid for the troubled sector ?
germany car industry leaders have also launched a campaign for government aid to help the key export sector to limp through the current financial crisis .
stuttgart-based daimler confirmed last month that it was in talks to finally sever links with troubled us carmaker chrysler , selling off its remaining 19.9-percent stake to the us equity group cerberus capital management lp .
this comes just over a year after cerberus bought an 80.1-percent stake in chrysler from daimler , as the german carmaker moved to end its nine-year troubled relationship with the us vehicle group . dpa news agency -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 23.10.2008 lawmakers castigate use of full-body scanners at airports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a body scanner in use on a male passenger at amsterdam 's schiphol airport full-body scanners - those that show people 's private parts - amount to a virtual strip search , eu lawmakers decided thursday as concerns about citizens ’ privacy trumped a debate on security . a plan to introduce full-body scanners at airports throughout the eu was voted down by a margin of 361 to 16 with 181 abstentions in the european parliament thursday .
saying that the scanners " have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens " , the lawmakers voted on a non-binding resolution asking the bloc 's executive european commission to carry out an economic , medical and human rights assessment of the impact of using full-body scanners .
body scanners use radio waves to display full-body images that reveal whether passengers are concealing weapons or explosives under their clothes .
the commission proposed last month that the scanners be added to a list of security measures that can be used at airports in the 27-country bloc .
the eu commission says the proposal is meant to harmonize the conditions in which they can be operated .
the scanners are already in use at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports to speed up security checks and to avoid hand-frisking passengers .
" a serious breach of fundamental rights " while the european parliament resolution does not call for an outright ban on such scanners , some eu lawmakers said they found them unacceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner is touted as a faster alternative to body searches " i think this is an offense against human dignity .
using this technology does not make us safer , " said the leader of the assembly 's socialist group , martin schulz .
" these devices allow one to see genitals , if a woman has big or small breasts , " said german social democrat lawmaker wolfgang kreissl-doerfler , during debate on the topic .
he said the idea was proof of the " paranoia of interior ministers " when it comes to the question of fighting terrorism .
green mep eva lichtenberger said the machines could be a " serious breach of fundamental rights and the defense of human dignity .
it seems that there is no real effort to see whether they really increase security . "
a voluntary way to speed up security screening european commission spokesman jens mester disagreed , however , saying that fears concerning the eu executive 's proposal were exaggerated .
" the body will indeed be pictured , " he said .
" but the quality is more that of a negative of a photograph , it is not a very clear image but sufficient to detect metal things , explosives or strange objects . "
ahead of the debate , eu transport commissioner antonio tajani likewise insisted that people would not be forced to go through them .
" the body scanner will never be made obligatory .
it 's an alternative to hand searches , " he said , adding that the images " would not be recorded and never stored " on a database .
he said the machines could help shorten security lines at airports , and that personally he found body searches to be more invasive than the machines .
" but everyone is free to choose , " he said . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economic ties , but also human rights and global warming , were on the meeting agenda , advisers said . at the start of her trip to beijing , merkel spoke of germany 's interest in creating " solid german-chinese economic ties , " and held up the daimler-chinese cooperation as an example .
merkel was at daimler for the celebration of the 25,000th daimler car to roll off the production line in beijing ; she was set to meet chinese premier wen jiabao in the afternoon of thursday , oct .
23 , for talks that are expected to focus on the global financial crisis .
the two leaders will then join some 40 other heads of state at the biannual asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- on friday and saturday .
merkel visit stresses importance of ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel feted the successful automobile cooperation german officials said the fact that merkel was one of the few foreign leaders making a formal state visit to china for the asem summit showed the importance of ties between the two nations .
the world financial crisis , and global warming , are expected to be the main focal points of the asem summit , which groups 27 european and 16 asian nations .
merkel is scheduled to meet president hu jintao on friday .
her talks with chinese leaders will deal with bilateral political and economic ties , as well as north korea 's heavily disputed atomic program , and relations with iran , german politicians told reporters .
moreover , merkel will meet with non-politicians such as journalists and writers .
the trip to china is merkel 's fist since she met with tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama last year , which led to strained ties between beijing and berlin .
calls for discussion on human rights green party politician volker beck told afp news service that he hoped merkel would bring up the " continuing poor state of human rights " in china , and urged her not to let the subject be overshadowed by talks of the financial crisis .
meanwhile , two other human-rights groups appealed to merkel to use the meetings to address human-rights issues , specifically the situation of china 's tibetan and uighur minorities .
merkel should press china for " tangible results from the dialogue between the dalai lama 's representatives and chinese officials , " kate saunders , communications director of the international campaign for tibet , told dpa press agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's 2007 meeting with the dalai lama shook china relations and a european-based group representing china 's mainly muslim uighur urged the german leader to press china to allow international investigation of claims that uighurs were involved in several plots to attack the beijing olympic games in august .
relations back to normal after dalai lama visit thomas steg , a deputy spokesman for merkel , told dpa that the chancellor would indeed raise human rights issues during her china visit .
" she 'll bring it up , " he said .
ruprecht polenz , a foreign affairs spokesman for merkel 's party , the christian democratic union , insisted that china-germany relations were back to normal after beijing 's displeasure at merkel meeting in her office last year with the dalai lama .
but polenz , who chairs the parliamentary committee on foreign policy , acknowledged that " human rights remain a problem issue . "
he called on beijing to grant greater autonomy to tibet . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the movie is based on the autobiographical account of marta hiller , a young woman in berlin between the months of april and june in 1945 .

coinciding with the release , a german university is investigating the trauma of the victims . the movie picks up a story long neglected in german post-war history : the plight of rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii .
" a woman in berlin " premiered at septembers ' film festival in toronto and is being released in theaters across germany on thursday , oct .
23 .
the movie is based on the autobiographical account of marta hiller , a young woman in berlin between the months of april and june in 1945 .
when the book was published anonymously in the 1950s , reactions were overwhelmingly negative .
from flop to bestseller a republished edition hit the shelves only as late as 2003 - - two years after hiller 's death - - and proved to be a bestseller .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their men gone , women were left to pick up the pieces the lead role is portrayed by german actress nina hoss , playing the young woman as soviet soldiers entered berlin in may 1945 .
she 's raped several times by red army soldiers until she eventually enters into a relationship with a russian officer to shield herself from further attacks .
rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii have long been a difficult chapter in german history , especially in communist east germany , where any criticism of the russian army was impossible .
" for the first time the phenomenon of mass rapes at the end of the war is the subject of a german movie , " said jochen-konrad fromme , a german parliamentarian and a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that means that 63 years after the end of the war , the fate and suffering of hundreds of thousands of german women is being acknowledged for the first time , " he added .
millions of victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress nina hoss says her character ' went through hell ' fromme added that historians estimate around 2 million women became victims of rape after the war .
cases of sexual violence also occurred in the western part of germany under the allied forces , yet historians agree that the problem was particularly acute under the soviet army .
coinciding with the release of the movie , the university of greifswald in northeastern germany has launched a research project to study the trauma of women raped during that period .
phillip kuwert , who is heading the project , said that it will help to analyze the long-term psychological effects .
better methods of treatment could then be developed for other conflict or war zones .
german newspapers have reacted with mixed reviews to " a woman in berlin . "

education is often a topic that gets politicians on their soap boxes .

the result was nothing more than expressions of good intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen " education should be top priority in germany , " they concluded .
yes , but was n't it top priority before ?
in dresden , state and federal delegations agreed to halve the number of high school and college dropouts .

money for banks , not for education it 's amazing that it is possible to decide on a billion-euro rescue package for the troubled finance industry in just a few days , but that it is apparently unfeasible to agree on financing germany 's most important resource - education .
what was announced on wednesday was merely symbolic : " look , we 've made it top priority ; we 'll take care of it . "
that sounds good , especially ahead of an election year in the federal parliament as well as several state governments .

" industry indicators predict weak overall economic activity in the third quarter , which should continue into 2009 , " the report said .
production and orders seemed to be down , generally , the report noted .
the report noted that germany 's crucial export sector is likely to hobble the economy at some point .
growth estimate slashed " immediate consequences of the global crisis on financial markets have been limited so far in germany .
but the crisis will be felt through a slowdown in the global economy , " said the report , which included previously published data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will german cars sell in a recession ?
the report said the " weakness of the global economy has weighed on exports " that contribute significantly to the economy , given that germany is the world 's leading exporter .
the government forecasts annual growth this year of 1.7 percent , owing to an exceptionally dynamic first quarter , but recently slashed its estimate for 2009 to just 0.2 percent .
third-quarter figures are expected in mid-november , but officials have warned gross domestic product would probably be " almost unchanged " from the second quarter , when it contracted by 0.5 percent .
two quarters running of economic contraction are the commonly accepted definition of a recession .
vw predicts carmakers will suffer meanwhile , volkswagen chairman ferdinand piëch told a german newspaper that he expects the german car industry to face a prolonged downturn .

for its part , the association of german retailers , or hde , releasted a statement calling for the govenrment to implement long-termchanges instead of short-sighted , industry-specific aid packages .
plea for tax relief hde president josef sanktjohanser came out against " short-term , branch-specific programs , " instead calling for " more financial latitude " for companies , including lower taxes and fees .
talking to the frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung on thursday , oct .
23 , he said his group was calling for an end to progressive income taxes .

" industry indicators predict weak overall economic activity in the third quarter , which should continue into 2009 , " the report said .
production and orders seemed to be down , generally , the report noted .
the report noted that germany 's crucial export sector is likely to hobble the economy at some point .
growth estimate slashed " immediate consequences of the global crisis on financial markets have been limited so far in germany .
but the crisis will be felt through a slowdown in the global economy , " said the report , which included previously published data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will german cars sell in a recession ?
the report said the " weakness of the global economy has weighed on exports " that contribute significantly to the economy , given that germany is the world 's leading exporter .
the government forecasts annual growth this year of 1.7 percent , owing to an exceptionally dynamic first quarter , but recently slashed its estimate for 2009 to just 0.2 percent .
third-quarter figures are expected in mid-november , but officials have warned gross domestic product would probably be " almost unchanged " from the second quarter , when it contracted by 0.5 percent .
two quarters running of economic contraction are the commonly accepted definition of a recession .
vw predicts carmakers will suffer meanwhile , volkswagen chairman ferdinand piëch told a german newspaper that he expects the german car industry to face a prolonged downturn .
the world economy suffering under the problems of the capital market , which is further damaging the already weak german economy , piech told the bild newspaper .

economic ties , but also human rights and global warming , were on the meeting agenda , advisers said . at the start of her trip to beijing , merkel spoke of germany 's interest in creating " solid german-chinese economic ties , " and held up the daimler-chinese cooperation as an example .
merkel was at daimler for the celebration of the 25,000th daimler car to roll off the production line in beijing ; she was set to meet chinese premier wen jiabao in the afternoon of thursday , oct .
23 , for talks that are expected to focus on the global financial crisis .
the two leaders will then join some 40 other heads of state at the biannual asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- on friday and saturday .
merkel visit stresses importance of ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel feted the successful automobile cooperation german officials said the fact that merkel was one of the few foreign leaders making a formal state visit to china for the asem summit showed the importance of ties between the two nations .
the world financial crisis , and global warming , are expected to be the main focal points of the asem summit , which groups 27 european and 16 asian nations .
merkel is scheduled to meet president hu jintao on friday .
her talks with chinese leaders will deal with bilateral political and economic ties , as well as north korea 's heavily disputed atomic program , and relations with iran , german politicians told reporters .
moreover , merkel will meet with non-politicians such as journalists and writers .
the trip to china is merkel 's fist since she met with tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama last year , which led to strained ties between beijing and berlin .
calls for discussion on human rights green party politician volker beck told afp news service that he hoped merkel would bring up the " continuing poor state of human rights " in china , and urged her not to let the subject be overshadowed by talks of the financial crisis .
meanwhile , two other human-rights groups appealed to merkel to use the meetings to address human-rights issues , specifically the situation of china 's tibetan and uighur minorities .
merkel should press china for " tangible results from the dialogue between the dalai lama 's representatives and chinese officials , " kate saunders , communications director of the international campaign for tibet , told dpa press agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's 2007 meeting with the dalai lama shook china relations and a european-based group representing china 's mainly muslim uighur urged the german leader to press china to allow international investigation of claims that uighurs were involved in several plots to attack the beijing olympic games in august .
relations back to normal after dalai lama visit thomas steg , a deputy spokesman for merkel , told dpa that the chancellor would indeed raise human rights issues during her china visit .
" she 'll bring it up , " he said .
ruprecht polenz , a foreign affairs spokesman for merkel 's party , the christian democratic union , insisted that china-germany relations were back to normal after beijing 's displeasure at merkel meeting in her office last year with the dalai lama .
but polenz , who chairs the parliamentary committee on foreign policy , acknowledged that " human rights remain a problem issue . "
he called on beijing to grant greater autonomy to tibet . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

saying that the scanners " have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens " , the lawmakers voted on a non-binding resolution asking the bloc 's executive european commission to carry out an economic , medical and human rights assessment of the impact of using full-body scanners .
body scanners use radio waves to display full-body images that reveal whether passengers are concealing weapons or explosives under their clothes .
the commission proposed last month that the scanners be added to a list of security measures that can be used at airports in the 27-country bloc .
the eu commission says the proposal is meant to harmonize the conditions in which they can be operated .
the scanners are already in use at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports to speed up security checks and to avoid hand-frisking passengers .

" it provides information about the fate of jews in national-socialist germany , their place of birth , their place of residence and about whether and when they left germany or when they were murdered , " franka kuehn , spokeswoman for the german foundation for remembrance , responsibility and future , which initiated the research project , told deutsche welle .
on thursday , oct .
23 , german culture minister bernd neumann and martin salm , the head of the foundation , officially lodged the list at yad vashem .
though the israeli memorial site has a huge database of its own , the german contribution is a valuable addition because it is based on over 1,000 sources - more than ever used at one time .
long-drawn out process kuehn said that several terminology issues had to be sorted out during the research process , as it was n't always clear who was a jew and who was n't .
the nazis ' own records of jews contained people who may have only sympathized with the jews and were therefore also persecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many holocaust victims were transported to death camps by train " the term jew had a racist connotation during the time of national socialism , " said kuehn .
one might ask whether golo mann -lrb- son of german writer thomas mann -rrb- would have wanted to see his name on a list of german jews , but it 's not our job as a foundation to answer these kinds of questions . "
the study follows a 1986 compilation , revised in 2005 , of the names of the 150,000 german jews killed in the holocaust .
a greater number of german jews managed to flee .
the nazis killed an estimated 6 million jews in europe .
the german foundation for remembrance , responsibility and future was founded in 2002 to organize compensation payments to forced laborers under the nazi regime .

tough times ahead : for the second time in only three months german car giant daimler reduced its expected profit for the next quarter .
the expected annual profit drops from almost 8 down to 6 billion euros . german carmaker daimler ag became the first of the country 's key auto groups to report its third-quarter results , reducing its earnings forecast again in face of deepening economic gloom .
the manufacturer of luxury mercedes-benz vehicles said it now expected to post operating profit in 2008 " of more than 6 billion euros " -lrb- $ 7.67 billion -rrb- .
high energy prices and economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will discounts help to encourage sales ?
daimler chief dieter zetsche had three months previously reduced the group 's 2008 earnings to about 7.0 billion euros from 7.7 billion euros , amid concerns that high energy prices and the prospects of an economic downturn will keep car buyers away from showrooms .
the group 's third-quarter net earnings were 213 million euros , compared with a 1.53-billion-euro loss a year earlier , the company said .
the weak state of the auto business has resulted in analysts expecting the german car sector to begin offering discounts to try to encourage sales .
government aid for the troubled sector ?
germany car industry leaders have also launched a campaign for government aid to help the key export sector to limp through the current financial crisis .
stuttgart-based daimler confirmed last month that it was in talks to finally sever links with troubled us carmaker chrysler , selling off its remaining 19.9-percent stake to the us equity group cerberus capital management lp .

coinciding with the release , a german university is investigating the trauma of the victims . the movie picks up a story long neglected in german post-war history : the plight of rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii .
" a woman in berlin " premiered at septembers ' film festival in toronto and is being released in theaters across germany on thursday , oct .
23 .
the movie is based on the autobiographical account of marta hiller , a young woman in berlin between the months of april and june in 1945 .
when the book was published anonymously in the 1950s , reactions were overwhelmingly negative .
from flop to bestseller a republished edition hit the shelves only as late as 2003 - - two years after hiller 's death - - and proved to be a bestseller .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their men gone , women were left to pick up the pieces the lead role is portrayed by german actress nina hoss , playing the young woman as soviet soldiers entered berlin in may 1945 .
she 's raped several times by red army soldiers until she eventually enters into a relationship with a russian officer to shield herself from further attacks .
rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii have long been a difficult chapter in german history , especially in communist east germany , where any criticism of the russian army was impossible .
" for the first time the phenomenon of mass rapes at the end of the war is the subject of a german movie , " said jochen-konrad fromme , a german parliamentarian and a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that means that 63 years after the end of the war , the fate and suffering of hundreds of thousands of german women is being acknowledged for the first time , " he added .
millions of victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress nina hoss says her character ' went through hell ' fromme added that historians estimate around 2 million women became victims of rape after the war .
cases of sexual violence also occurred in the western part of germany under the allied forces , yet historians agree that the problem was particularly acute under the soviet army .
coinciding with the release of the movie , the university of greifswald in northeastern germany has launched a research project to study the trauma of women raped during that period .
phillip kuwert , who is heading the project , said that it will help to analyze the long-term psychological effects .
better methods of treatment could then be developed for other conflict or war zones .
german newspapers have reacted with mixed reviews to " a woman in berlin . "
some critics are bashing the filmmakers for treating the serious subject on a level way too trivial and sentimental .
others praise the movie for bringing a chapter of german history to a wider audience which so far many people have been ill-informed about . dw staff -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 23.10.2008 opinion : education draws the short stick in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : better education for kids and youth in germany - that would have been just as important as bailing out the banking sector .
but this week 's education summit missed the mark , says dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen . unfortunately , the politicians at the education summit in dresden on wednesday , oct .
22 , did n't present any solutions that fit the problem .
education is often a topic that gets politicians on their soap boxes .
but at the summit , the issue was once again used as a means to boost their political images .
the result was nothing more than expressions of good intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen " education should be top priority in germany , " they concluded .
yes , but was n't it top priority before ?
in dresden , state and federal delegations agreed to halve the number of high school and college dropouts .
that 's been called for many times , but changes have yet to be seen .
the state and federal governments have also said they want to increase the education budget by 10 percent by the year 2015 .
that sounds good - but no one has said how they plan to reach this goal .
money for banks , not for education it 's amazing that it is possible to decide on a billion-euro rescue package for the troubled finance industry in just a few days , but that it is apparently unfeasible to agree on financing germany 's most important resource - education .
what was announced on wednesday was merely symbolic : " look , we 've made it top priority ; we 'll take care of it . "
that sounds good , especially ahead of an election year in the federal parliament as well as several state governments .
after all , a committee was established to figure out how the ambitious goals can be financed .
but there wo n't be any results until after the 2009 bundestag election .
delay instead of action , that 's the motto .
' education for all ' still just a dream once again , the main problems with the german education system were n't addressed .
it 's a disaster that , in a wealthy country like germany , parents ' bank accounts still determine their children 's education options .
former chancellor willy brandt 's appeal in the 1970s for " education for all " has never been fulfilled .
the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school and the working class child goes to the third-tier tech school - that 's still often the case .
children with so-called non-academic backgrounds or from immigrant families are n't challenged enough and their potential goes unrecognized .
germany 's education budget is well below the average of many other industrial countries .
particularly in the elementary schools , much less is invested per child than elsewhere .
germany is the only country in the world that demands several hundred euros a month from young parents so their child can attend pre-school .
education path determined too early furthermore , in no other country does the selection process - the sorting of children into various types of schools - begin so early .
a pupil 's educational path is decided after the fourth grade .
the familiar learning environment , where children learn well and yet differentiated , gets lost . nearly all german education experts agree that the solution is for pupils to spend more time learning together in a positive environment , without pressure to perform .
but in dresden , concrete steps and strategies were n't discussed .
chancellor angela merkel praised wednesday 's resolutions as an important step toward an " education republic of germany . "
but , as one newspaper commented , the " education illusion of germany " would be a more appropriate term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 23.10.2008 germany compiles list of nazi-era jews and their fates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yad vashem is internationally known as a place for holocaust research after four years of detailed research , the most complete list to-date of jewish residents living in germany between 1933 and 1945 has been handed over to the yad vashem holocaust memorial site in jerusalem . over six decades after the end of the holocaust , family members and scholars can use the list , which includes some 600,000 names , to find out the fate of individuals during the holocaust . " it provides information about the fate of jews in national-socialist germany , their place of birth , their place of residence and about whether and when they left germany or when they were murdered , " franka kuehn , spokeswoman for the german foundation for remembrance , responsibility and future , which initiated the research project , told deutsche welle .
on thursday , oct .
23 , german culture minister bernd neumann and martin salm , the head of the foundation , officially lodged the list at yad vashem .
though the israeli memorial site has a huge database of its own , the german contribution is a valuable addition because it is based on over 1,000 sources - more than ever used at one time .
long-drawn out process kuehn said that several terminology issues had to be sorted out during the research process , as it was n't always clear who was a jew and who was n't .
the nazis ' own records of jews contained people who may have only sympathized with the jews and were therefore also persecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many holocaust victims were transported to death camps by train " the term jew had a racist connotation during the time of national socialism , " said kuehn .
one might ask whether golo mann -lrb- son of german writer thomas mann -rrb- would have wanted to see his name on a list of german jews , but it 's not our job as a foundation to answer these kinds of questions . "
the study follows a 1986 compilation , revised in 2005 , of the names of the 150,000 german jews killed in the holocaust .
a greater number of german jews managed to flee .
the nazis killed an estimated 6 million jews in europe .
the german foundation for remembrance , responsibility and future was founded in 2002 to organize compensation payments to forced laborers under the nazi regime .
by the end of 2007 , the foundation had disbursed 4.37 billion euros from german industries and the state to more than 1.5 million people in 98 countries . dw staff -lrb- hg / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it provides information about the fate of jews in national-socialist germany , their place of birth , their place of residence and about whether and when they left germany or when they were murdered , " franka kuehn , spokeswoman for the german foundation for remembrance , responsibility and future , which initiated the research project , told deutsche welle .
on thursday , oct .
23 , german culture minister bernd neumann and martin salm , the head of the foundation , officially lodged the list at yad vashem .
though the israeli memorial site has a huge database of its own , the german contribution is a valuable addition because it is based on over 1,000 sources - more than ever used at one time .
long-drawn out process kuehn said that several terminology issues had to be sorted out during the research process , as it was n't always clear who was a jew and who was n't .
the nazis ' own records of jews contained people who may have only sympathized with the jews and were therefore also persecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many holocaust victims were transported to death camps by train " the term jew had a racist connotation during the time of national socialism , " said kuehn .
one might ask whether golo mann -lrb- son of german writer thomas mann -rrb- would have wanted to see his name on a list of german jews , but it 's not our job as a foundation to answer these kinds of questions . "
the study follows a 1986 compilation , revised in 2005 , of the names of the 150,000 german jews killed in the holocaust .
a greater number of german jews managed to flee .
the nazis killed an estimated 6 million jews in europe .
the german foundation for remembrance , responsibility and future was founded in 2002 to organize compensation payments to forced laborers under the nazi regime .
by the end of 2007 , the foundation had disbursed 4.37 billion euros from german industries and the state to more than 1.5 million people in 98 countries . dw staff -lrb- hg / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.10.2008 two jailed in ivory coast in dutch toxic dumping scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ivorian man in an oxygen mask in abijhan where toxic waste was dumped a court in ivory coast jailed two people over a deadly 2006 dumping of toxic waste which killed at least 17 people and poisoned thousands after a dutch firm paid an african company to dispose 500 tons of toxic liquid . it 's a case of catching the little fish while watching the big fish wriggle away .
at least for now .
the little fish , also known as salomon ugborugo , was the head of the ivory coast company , which in 2006 agreed to dispose of 500 tons of liquid waste for the big fish - - otherwise known as dutch multinational firm trafigura . ugborugo 's company did get rid of the waste .
the problem was , they did so without treating it , and the resulting fumes killed an estimated 17 people and have made an estimated 100,000 people in abidjan ill . now , for his role ugborugo is looking at 20 years behind bars .
his partner at the city ’ s port will get 5 years .
ugborugo 's lawyer says he 's appalled by the verdict . " the element of intention was clearly missing .
i would have understood if he was only condemned of involuntary homicide . "
the lawyer insists that his client hadn ’ t been aware that the waste was so dangerous . who is to blame ?
the trail leads to the netherlands it ’ s hard to say how much ugborugo actually knew about the dangerous load his company was dumping . but either way , if you follow the story back up the food chain , it doesn ’ t take long to get back to the netherlands-based trafigura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the clearing efforts , much of the toxic waste is still polluting the area marietta harjono from green peace international , says she hopes the buck doesn ’ t just stop with ugborugo .
" trafigura is a big , multi-billion dollar oil company , " she says .
" the only goal is to make as much money as possible . " trafigura had tried to dispose of the waste in amsterdam , hiding the fact that it was toxic .
but once the truth came out , the tanker full of toxic liquid shipped off to africa , hoping to bypass the hundreds of thousands euros it would have cost to safely treat the material . and that ’ s when the trafigura story merged with ugborugo ’ s . 200 million to avoid a lawsuit when it became clear what had made people sick in abidjan , trafigura paid ivory coast more than $ 200 million to avoid a lawsuit in the west african country .
it seems like a lot , but that amount could be peanuts compared to what the disaster has actually cost ivory coast in terms of health care and environmental clean up costs . with that in mind the netherlands has announced it ’ s suing trafigura for illegal dumping practices and a law firm in england has agreed to bring a suit against the company on behalf of 30,000 plaintiffs affected by the waste in abidjan .
unfortunately for the residents of abidjan , regardless of the outcomes in the courts , the nightmare continues , with much of the toxic waste still polluting the air . eric heath -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

coinciding with the release , a german university is investigating the trauma of the victims . the movie picks up a story long neglected in german post-war history : the plight of rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii .
" a woman in berlin " premiered at septembers ' film festival in toronto and is being released in theaters across germany on thursday , oct .
23 .
the movie is based on the autobiographical account of marta hiller , a young woman in berlin between the months of april and june in 1945 .
when the book was published anonymously in the 1950s , reactions were overwhelmingly negative .
from flop to bestseller a republished edition hit the shelves only as late as 2003 - - two years after hiller 's death - - and proved to be a bestseller .

she 's raped several times by red army soldiers until she eventually enters into a relationship with a russian officer to shield herself from further attacks .
rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii have long been a difficult chapter in german history , especially in communist east germany , where any criticism of the russian army was impossible .
" for the first time the phenomenon of mass rapes at the end of the war is the subject of a german movie , " said jochen-konrad fromme , a german parliamentarian and a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that means that 63 years after the end of the war , the fate and suffering of hundreds of thousands of german women is being acknowledged for the first time , " he added .
millions of victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress nina hoss says her character ' went through hell ' fromme added that historians estimate around 2 million women became victims of rape after the war .
cases of sexual violence also occurred in the western part of germany under the allied forces , yet historians agree that the problem was particularly acute under the soviet army .
coinciding with the release of the movie , the university of greifswald in northeastern germany has launched a research project to study the trauma of women raped during that period .
phillip kuwert , who is heading the project , said that it will help to analyze the long-term psychological effects .
better methods of treatment could then be developed for other conflict or war zones .
german newspapers have reacted with mixed reviews to " a woman in berlin . "

saying that the scanners " have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens " , the lawmakers voted on a non-binding resolution asking the bloc 's executive european commission to carry out an economic , medical and human rights assessment of the impact of using full-body scanners .
body scanners use radio waves to display full-body images that reveal whether passengers are concealing weapons or explosives under their clothes .
the commission proposed last month that the scanners be added to a list of security measures that can be used at airports in the 27-country bloc .
the eu commission says the proposal is meant to harmonize the conditions in which they can be operated .
the scanners are already in use at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports to speed up security checks and to avoid hand-frisking passengers .
" a serious breach of fundamental rights " while the european parliament resolution does not call for an outright ban on such scanners , some eu lawmakers said they found them unacceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner is touted as a faster alternative to body searches " i think this is an offense against human dignity .
using this technology does not make us safer , " said the leader of the assembly 's socialist group , martin schulz .
" these devices allow one to see genitals , if a woman has big or small breasts , " said german social democrat lawmaker wolfgang kreissl-doerfler , during debate on the topic .
he said the idea was proof of the " paranoia of interior ministers " when it comes to the question of fighting terrorism .
green mep eva lichtenberger said the machines could be a " serious breach of fundamental rights and the defense of human dignity .
it seems that there is no real effort to see whether they really increase security . "
a voluntary way to speed up security screening european commission spokesman jens mester disagreed , however , saying that fears concerning the eu executive 's proposal were exaggerated .
" the body will indeed be pictured , " he said .
" but the quality is more that of a negative of a photograph , it is not a very clear image but sufficient to detect metal things , explosives or strange objects . "
ahead of the debate , eu transport commissioner antonio tajani likewise insisted that people would not be forced to go through them .
" the body scanner will never be made obligatory .
it 's an alternative to hand searches , " he said , adding that the images " would not be recorded and never stored " on a database .
he said the machines could help shorten security lines at airports , and that personally he found body searches to be more invasive than the machines .
" but everyone is free to choose , " he said . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

daimler chief dieter zetsche had three months previously reduced the group 's 2008 earnings to about 7.0 billion euros from 7.7 billion euros , amid concerns that high energy prices and the prospects of an economic downturn will keep car buyers away from showrooms .
the group 's third-quarter net earnings were 213 million euros , compared with a 1.53-billion-euro loss a year earlier , the company said .
the weak state of the auto business has resulted in analysts expecting the german car sector to begin offering discounts to try to encourage sales .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 23.10.2008 report : sarkozy wants to lead euro zone until 2010 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the midst of the finance crisis , the euro zone needs a strong leader , says sarkozy french president nicolas sarkozy reportedly said he wants to become president of the euro zone countries once his term as eu heads expires at the end of the year . according to the french daily le monde on wednesday , oct .
22 , several advisors to the french president have confirmed this strategy .
sarkozy 's ambition is based on his firm conviction that the crisis in georgia and the financial crisis both demonstrated that europe was in need of a strong leader .
according to le monde , sarkozy believes that without such an individual at the helm , the eu would never have been able to negotiate with moscow or decide on an effective plan to rescue european banks .
in addition , with ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty , there will be no stable presidency of the eu , elected for a period of 30 months , as the treaty had foreseen .
next eu presidencies not in euro zone as a result , the eu will be led by the euro-skeptic czech president vaclav klaus and his prime minister , mirek topolanek , beginning on jan .
1 , 2009 , with the prague government fighting for survival after a landslide defeat in recent regional elections .
in july 2009 , the eu will be headed by sweden , which - like the czechs - does not use the single currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next two eu presidency holders are outside the euro zone to avoid what he foresees as a paralysis in the eu , sarkozy sees the soon-to-be 16-member euro zone as an effective alternative , as it was on oct .
12 , when euro zone leaders formulated the european bank rescue plan at a summit in paris convened by the french president .
in a speech before eu parliamentarians in strasbourg on tuesday , sarkozy said that " a meeting of -lrb- eu -rrb- finance ministers is not up to dealing with the crisis . "
german minister rejects joint economic governance only heads of state and government " have the democratic legitimacy " to decide such wide-ranging measures as the bank rescue plan , he said in strasbourg .
since the eurogroup has no legal existence , a euro zone president could be elected without resorting to a constitution .
or a decision could be taken to allow france - that is , sarkozy - to continue in a leadership position until the eu presidency reverts to a country that uses the euro , which would be spain in january 2010 .
however , it seems unlikely that other eu countries will go along with the idea .
in an interview published wednesday in the french business daily la tribune , german economics minister michael glos said the proposal of a single economic governance of euro zone countries was " not suitable for resolving the current problems . "
the problems of individual eu member nations were diverse , he said , and the majority of economic policies should remain national decisions . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , for defending the rights of people living with hiv / aids . " awarding the sakharov to hu jia is a reflection of the very spirit of this prize , which supports free thought and honors human rights defenders fighting repression , " greens leaders daniel cohn-bendit and monica frassoni said in a statement . hu is currently serving a three-and-a-half-year jail term on charges of subversion .
beijing on thursday insisted that hu is a criminal . " to issue an award to such a criminal amounts to interference in china 's judicial sovereignty and is totally against the purpose of this prize , " said government spokesman qin gang . the sakharov award announcement comes just one day ahead of an asia-europe summit , but qin declined to say whether hu 's recognition would have a negative impact on the talks . uncovering a ' state secret ' hu 's activism began in the late 1990s when the economics graduate volunteered to work on environmental projects . in 2001 , he began helping villagers infected with hiv / aids through blood-selling schemes in the central province of henan .
the following year , hu and four friends had their first run-in with state security police who intercepted them and seized film after they traveled to henan villages . the group took christmas toys and clothes to children in poor villages that were decimated due to aids spread by the illegal collection and sale of blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hu said the sars epidemic helped draw awareness to the aids problem in china " it seemed like the worst scenes of aids in africa , with old and young people infected , " hu told dpa news agency .
" state security police threatened us and said that aids was a state secret , " he said . hu said he believes that china was " lucky " to be shaken out of its complacency on aids by the scandal over a cover-up of hundreds of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- in beijing . " after sars in 2003 , nobody dared to say that aids was a state secret any more , " hu said .
" it gave us an opportunity to be more open . " activism despite house arrest his continued advocacy for the rights of people living with hiv / aids in china brought him international attention and several awards . but after two years of relatively open activism , the climate began to change with the arrest and harassment of aids activists in 2005 , he said . in 2006 and 2007 he was forced to spend most of his time confined inside his suburban apartment on the outskirts of beijing .
before his formal arrest in late december , hu had spent most of the previous two years under virtual house arrest or other forms of detention . he used his enforced isolation to act as a bridge between foreign media and the growing number of rights activists across the country , collecting and disseminating information on rights cases and other issues in china via the internet and telephone . in november , he and his wife zeng jinyan managed to testify in a telephone call to the european parliamentary hearing on the rights situation in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nelson mandela was the first recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize in 1988 despite appeals from the european union , the united states and rights groups for his release , a beijing court in april sentenced hu to three and a half years in prison for " inciting subversion of state power " after a one-day trial . the sakharov prize , in its 20th year , is named for the soviet dissident andrei sakharov , who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1975 .

" awarding the sakharov to hu jia is a reflection of the very spirit of this prize , which supports free thought and honors human rights defenders fighting repression , " greens leaders daniel cohn-bendit and monica frassoni said in a statement . hu is currently serving a three-and-a-half-year jail term on charges of subversion .
beijing on thursday insisted that hu is a criminal . " to issue an award to such a criminal amounts to interference in china 's judicial sovereignty and is totally against the purpose of this prize , " said government spokesman qin gang . the sakharov award announcement comes just one day ahead of an asia-europe summit , but qin declined to say whether hu 's recognition would have a negative impact on the talks . uncovering a ' state secret ' hu 's activism began in the late 1990s when the economics graduate volunteered to work on environmental projects . in 2001 , he began helping villagers infected with hiv / aids through blood-selling schemes in the central province of henan .

before his formal arrest in late december , hu had spent most of the previous two years under virtual house arrest or other forms of detention . he used his enforced isolation to act as a bridge between foreign media and the growing number of rights activists across the country , collecting and disseminating information on rights cases and other issues in china via the internet and telephone . in november , he and his wife zeng jinyan managed to testify in a telephone call to the european parliamentary hearing on the rights situation in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nelson mandela was the first recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize in 1988 despite appeals from the european union , the united states and rights groups for his release , a beijing court in april sentenced hu to three and a half years in prison for " inciting subversion of state power " after a one-day trial . the sakharov prize , in its 20th year , is named for the soviet dissident andrei sakharov , who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1975 .

22 , several advisors to the french president have confirmed this strategy .
sarkozy 's ambition is based on his firm conviction that the crisis in georgia and the financial crisis both demonstrated that europe was in need of a strong leader .
according to le monde , sarkozy believes that without such an individual at the helm , the eu would never have been able to negotiate with moscow or decide on an effective plan to rescue european banks .
in addition , with ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty , there will be no stable presidency of the eu , elected for a period of 30 months , as the treaty had foreseen .
next eu presidencies not in euro zone as a result , the eu will be led by the euro-skeptic czech president vaclav klaus and his prime minister , mirek topolanek , beginning on jan .

12 , when euro zone leaders formulated the european bank rescue plan at a summit in paris convened by the french president .
in a speech before eu parliamentarians in strasbourg on tuesday , sarkozy said that " a meeting of -lrb- eu -rrb- finance ministers is not up to dealing with the crisis . "
german minister rejects joint economic governance only heads of state and government " have the democratic legitimacy " to decide such wide-ranging measures as the bank rescue plan , he said in strasbourg .
since the eurogroup has no legal existence , a euro zone president could be elected without resorting to a constitution .
or a decision could be taken to allow france - that is , sarkozy - to continue in a leadership position until the eu presidency reverts to a country that uses the euro , which would be spain in january 2010 .
however , it seems unlikely that other eu countries will go along with the idea .
in an interview published wednesday in the french business daily la tribune , german economics minister michael glos said the proposal of a single economic governance of euro zone countries was " not suitable for resolving the current problems . "
the problems of individual eu member nations were diverse , he said , and the majority of economic policies should remain national decisions . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economic ties , but also human rights and global warming , were on the meeting agenda , advisers said . at the start of her trip to beijing , merkel spoke of germany 's interest in creating " solid german-chinese economic ties , " and held up the daimler-chinese cooperation as an example .
merkel was at daimler for the celebration of the 25,000th daimler car to roll off the production line in beijing ; she was set to meet chinese premier wen jiabao in the afternoon of thursday , oct .
23 , for talks that are expected to focus on the global financial crisis .
the two leaders will then join some 40 other heads of state at the biannual asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- on friday and saturday .
merkel visit stresses importance of ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel feted the successful automobile cooperation german officials said the fact that merkel was one of the few foreign leaders making a formal state visit to china for the asem summit showed the importance of ties between the two nations .
the world financial crisis , and global warming , are expected to be the main focal points of the asem summit , which groups 27 european and 16 asian nations .
merkel is scheduled to meet president hu jintao on friday .
her talks with chinese leaders will deal with bilateral political and economic ties , as well as north korea 's heavily disputed atomic program , and relations with iran , german politicians told reporters .
moreover , merkel will meet with non-politicians such as journalists and writers .
the trip to china is merkel 's fist since she met with tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama last year , which led to strained ties between beijing and berlin .
calls for discussion on human rights green party politician volker beck told afp news service that he hoped merkel would bring up the " continuing poor state of human rights " in china , and urged her not to let the subject be overshadowed by talks of the financial crisis .
meanwhile , two other human-rights groups appealed to merkel to use the meetings to address human-rights issues , specifically the situation of china 's tibetan and uighur minorities .
merkel should press china for " tangible results from the dialogue between the dalai lama 's representatives and chinese officials , " kate saunders , communications director of the international campaign for tibet , told dpa press agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's 2007 meeting with the dalai lama shook china relations and a european-based group representing china 's mainly muslim uighur urged the german leader to press china to allow international investigation of claims that uighurs were involved in several plots to attack the beijing olympic games in august .
relations back to normal after dalai lama visit thomas steg , a deputy spokesman for merkel , told dpa that the chancellor would indeed raise human rights issues during her china visit .
" she 'll bring it up , " he said .
ruprecht polenz , a foreign affairs spokesman for merkel 's party , the christian democratic union , insisted that china-germany relations were back to normal after beijing 's displeasure at merkel meeting in her office last year with the dalai lama .
but polenz , who chairs the parliamentary committee on foreign policy , acknowledged that " human rights remain a problem issue . "
he called on beijing to grant greater autonomy to tibet . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economic ties , but also human rights and global warming , were on the meeting agenda , advisers said . at the start of her trip to beijing , merkel spoke of germany 's interest in creating " solid german-chinese economic ties , " and held up the daimler-chinese cooperation as an example .
merkel was at daimler for the celebration of the 25,000th daimler car to roll off the production line in beijing ; she was set to meet chinese premier wen jiabao in the afternoon of thursday , oct .
23 , for talks that are expected to focus on the global financial crisis .
the two leaders will then join some 40 other heads of state at the biannual asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- on friday and saturday .
merkel visit stresses importance of ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel feted the successful automobile cooperation german officials said the fact that merkel was one of the few foreign leaders making a formal state visit to china for the asem summit showed the importance of ties between the two nations .
the world financial crisis , and global warming , are expected to be the main focal points of the asem summit , which groups 27 european and 16 asian nations .
merkel is scheduled to meet president hu jintao on friday .
her talks with chinese leaders will deal with bilateral political and economic ties , as well as north korea 's heavily disputed atomic program , and relations with iran , german politicians told reporters .
moreover , merkel will meet with non-politicians such as journalists and writers .
the trip to china is merkel 's fist since she met with tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama last year , which led to strained ties between beijing and berlin .
calls for discussion on human rights green party politician volker beck told afp news service that he hoped merkel would bring up the " continuing poor state of human rights " in china , and urged her not to let the subject be overshadowed by talks of the financial crisis .
meanwhile , two other human-rights groups appealed to merkel to use the meetings to address human-rights issues , specifically the situation of china 's tibetan and uighur minorities .
merkel should press china for " tangible results from the dialogue between the dalai lama 's representatives and chinese officials , " kate saunders , communications director of the international campaign for tibet , told dpa press agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's 2007 meeting with the dalai lama shook china relations and a european-based group representing china 's mainly muslim uighur urged the german leader to press china to allow international investigation of claims that uighurs were involved in several plots to attack the beijing olympic games in august .
relations back to normal after dalai lama visit thomas steg , a deputy spokesman for merkel , told dpa that the chancellor would indeed raise human rights issues during her china visit .
" she 'll bring it up , " he said .
ruprecht polenz , a foreign affairs spokesman for merkel 's party , the christian democratic union , insisted that china-germany relations were back to normal after beijing 's displeasure at merkel meeting in her office last year with the dalai lama .
but polenz , who chairs the parliamentary committee on foreign policy , acknowledged that " human rights remain a problem issue . "
he called on beijing to grant greater autonomy to tibet . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 23.10.2008 lawmakers castigate use of full-body scanners at airports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a body scanner in use on a male passenger at amsterdam 's schiphol airport full-body scanners - those that show people 's private parts - amount to a virtual strip search , eu lawmakers decided thursday as concerns about citizens ’ privacy trumped a debate on security . a plan to introduce full-body scanners at airports throughout the eu was voted down by a margin of 361 to 16 with 181 abstentions in the european parliament thursday .
saying that the scanners " have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens " , the lawmakers voted on a non-binding resolution asking the bloc 's executive european commission to carry out an economic , medical and human rights assessment of the impact of using full-body scanners .
body scanners use radio waves to display full-body images that reveal whether passengers are concealing weapons or explosives under their clothes .
the commission proposed last month that the scanners be added to a list of security measures that can be used at airports in the 27-country bloc .
the eu commission says the proposal is meant to harmonize the conditions in which they can be operated .
the scanners are already in use at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports to speed up security checks and to avoid hand-frisking passengers .
" a serious breach of fundamental rights " while the european parliament resolution does not call for an outright ban on such scanners , some eu lawmakers said they found them unacceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner is touted as a faster alternative to body searches " i think this is an offense against human dignity .
using this technology does not make us safer , " said the leader of the assembly 's socialist group , martin schulz .
" these devices allow one to see genitals , if a woman has big or small breasts , " said german social democrat lawmaker wolfgang kreissl-doerfler , during debate on the topic .
he said the idea was proof of the " paranoia of interior ministers " when it comes to the question of fighting terrorism .
green mep eva lichtenberger said the machines could be a " serious breach of fundamental rights and the defense of human dignity .
it seems that there is no real effort to see whether they really increase security . "
a voluntary way to speed up security screening european commission spokesman jens mester disagreed , however , saying that fears concerning the eu executive 's proposal were exaggerated .
" the body will indeed be pictured , " he said .
" but the quality is more that of a negative of a photograph , it is not a very clear image but sufficient to detect metal things , explosives or strange objects . "
ahead of the debate , eu transport commissioner antonio tajani likewise insisted that people would not be forced to go through them .
" the body scanner will never be made obligatory .
it 's an alternative to hand searches , " he said , adding that the images " would not be recorded and never stored " on a database .
he said the machines could help shorten security lines at airports , and that personally he found body searches to be more invasive than the machines .
" but everyone is free to choose , " he said . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

daimler chief dieter zetsche had three months previously reduced the group 's 2008 earnings to about 7.0 billion euros from 7.7 billion euros , amid concerns that high energy prices and the prospects of an economic downturn will keep car buyers away from showrooms .
the group 's third-quarter net earnings were 213 million euros , compared with a 1.53-billion-euro loss a year earlier , the company said .
the weak state of the auto business has resulted in analysts expecting the german car sector to begin offering discounts to try to encourage sales .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 23.10.2008 report : sarkozy wants to lead euro zone until 2010 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the midst of the finance crisis , the euro zone needs a strong leader , says sarkozy french president nicolas sarkozy reportedly said he wants to become president of the euro zone countries once his term as eu heads expires at the end of the year . according to the french daily le monde on wednesday , oct .
22 , several advisors to the french president have confirmed this strategy .
sarkozy 's ambition is based on his firm conviction that the crisis in georgia and the financial crisis both demonstrated that europe was in need of a strong leader .
according to le monde , sarkozy believes that without such an individual at the helm , the eu would never have been able to negotiate with moscow or decide on an effective plan to rescue european banks .
in addition , with ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty , there will be no stable presidency of the eu , elected for a period of 30 months , as the treaty had foreseen .
next eu presidencies not in euro zone as a result , the eu will be led by the euro-skeptic czech president vaclav klaus and his prime minister , mirek topolanek , beginning on jan .
1 , 2009 , with the prague government fighting for survival after a landslide defeat in recent regional elections .
in july 2009 , the eu will be headed by sweden , which - like the czechs - does not use the single currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next two eu presidency holders are outside the euro zone to avoid what he foresees as a paralysis in the eu , sarkozy sees the soon-to-be 16-member euro zone as an effective alternative , as it was on oct .
12 , when euro zone leaders formulated the european bank rescue plan at a summit in paris convened by the french president .
in a speech before eu parliamentarians in strasbourg on tuesday , sarkozy said that " a meeting of -lrb- eu -rrb- finance ministers is not up to dealing with the crisis . "
german minister rejects joint economic governance only heads of state and government " have the democratic legitimacy " to decide such wide-ranging measures as the bank rescue plan , he said in strasbourg .
since the eurogroup has no legal existence , a euro zone president could be elected without resorting to a constitution .
or a decision could be taken to allow france - that is , sarkozy - to continue in a leadership position until the eu presidency reverts to a country that uses the euro , which would be spain in january 2010 .
however , it seems unlikely that other eu countries will go along with the idea .
in an interview published wednesday in the french business daily la tribune , german economics minister michael glos said the proposal of a single economic governance of euro zone countries was " not suitable for resolving the current problems . "

tough times ahead : for the second time in only three months german car giant daimler reduced its expected profit for the next quarter .
the expected annual profit drops from almost 8 down to 6 billion euros . german carmaker daimler ag became the first of the country 's key auto groups to report its third-quarter results , reducing its earnings forecast again in face of deepening economic gloom .
the manufacturer of luxury mercedes-benz vehicles said it now expected to post operating profit in 2008 " of more than 6 billion euros " -lrb- $ 7.67 billion -rrb- .
high energy prices and economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will discounts help to encourage sales ?
daimler chief dieter zetsche had three months previously reduced the group 's 2008 earnings to about 7.0 billion euros from 7.7 billion euros , amid concerns that high energy prices and the prospects of an economic downturn will keep car buyers away from showrooms .
the group 's third-quarter net earnings were 213 million euros , compared with a 1.53-billion-euro loss a year earlier , the company said .
the weak state of the auto business has resulted in analysts expecting the german car sector to begin offering discounts to try to encourage sales .
government aid for the troubled sector ?
germany car industry leaders have also launched a campaign for government aid to help the key export sector to limp through the current financial crisis .
stuttgart-based daimler confirmed last month that it was in talks to finally sever links with troubled us carmaker chrysler , selling off its remaining 19.9-percent stake to the us equity group cerberus capital management lp .
this comes just over a year after cerberus bought an 80.1-percent stake in chrysler from daimler , as the german carmaker moved to end its nine-year troubled relationship with the us vehicle group . dpa news agency -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beijing on thursday insisted that hu is a criminal .

the movie is based on the autobiographical account of marta hiller , a young woman in berlin between the months of april and june in 1945 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 23.10.2008 lawmakers castigate use of full-body scanners at airports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a body scanner in use on a male passenger at amsterdam 's schiphol airport full-body scanners - those that show people 's private parts - amount to a virtual strip search , eu lawmakers decided thursday as concerns about citizens ’ privacy trumped a debate on security . a plan to introduce full-body scanners at airports throughout the eu was voted down by a margin of 361 to 16 with 181 abstentions in the european parliament thursday .
saying that the scanners " have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens " , the lawmakers voted on a non-binding resolution asking the bloc 's executive european commission to carry out an economic , medical and human rights assessment of the impact of using full-body scanners .
body scanners use radio waves to display full-body images that reveal whether passengers are concealing weapons or explosives under their clothes .
the commission proposed last month that the scanners be added to a list of security measures that can be used at airports in the 27-country bloc .
the eu commission says the proposal is meant to harmonize the conditions in which they can be operated .
the scanners are already in use at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports to speed up security checks and to avoid hand-frisking passengers .
" a serious breach of fundamental rights " while the european parliament resolution does not call for an outright ban on such scanners , some eu lawmakers said they found them unacceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner is touted as a faster alternative to body searches " i think this is an offense against human dignity .
using this technology does not make us safer , " said the leader of the assembly 's socialist group , martin schulz .
" these devices allow one to see genitals , if a woman has big or small breasts , " said german social democrat lawmaker wolfgang kreissl-doerfler , during debate on the topic .
he said the idea was proof of the " paranoia of interior ministers " when it comes to the question of fighting terrorism .
green mep eva lichtenberger said the machines could be a " serious breach of fundamental rights and the defense of human dignity .
it seems that there is no real effort to see whether they really increase security . "
a voluntary way to speed up security screening european commission spokesman jens mester disagreed , however , saying that fears concerning the eu executive 's proposal were exaggerated .
" the body will indeed be pictured , " he said .
" but the quality is more that of a negative of a photograph , it is not a very clear image but sufficient to detect metal things , explosives or strange objects . "
ahead of the debate , eu transport commissioner antonio tajani likewise insisted that people would not be forced to go through them .
" the body scanner will never be made obligatory .
it 's an alternative to hand searches , " he said , adding that the images " would not be recorded and never stored " on a database .
he said the machines could help shorten security lines at airports , and that personally he found body searches to be more invasive than the machines .
" but everyone is free to choose , " he said . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economic ties , but also human rights and global warming , were on the meeting agenda , advisers said . at the start of her trip to beijing , merkel spoke of germany 's interest in creating " solid german-chinese economic ties , " and held up the daimler-chinese cooperation as an example .
merkel was at daimler for the celebration of the 25,000th daimler car to roll off the production line in beijing ; she was set to meet chinese premier wen jiabao in the afternoon of thursday , oct .
23 , for talks that are expected to focus on the global financial crisis .
the two leaders will then join some 40 other heads of state at the biannual asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- on friday and saturday .
merkel visit stresses importance of ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel feted the successful automobile cooperation german officials said the fact that merkel was one of the few foreign leaders making a formal state visit to china for the asem summit showed the importance of ties between the two nations .
the world financial crisis , and global warming , are expected to be the main focal points of the asem summit , which groups 27 european and 16 asian nations .
merkel is scheduled to meet president hu jintao on friday .
her talks with chinese leaders will deal with bilateral political and economic ties , as well as north korea 's heavily disputed atomic program , and relations with iran , german politicians told reporters .
moreover , merkel will meet with non-politicians such as journalists and writers .
the trip to china is merkel 's fist since she met with tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama last year , which led to strained ties between beijing and berlin .
calls for discussion on human rights green party politician volker beck told afp news service that he hoped merkel would bring up the " continuing poor state of human rights " in china , and urged her not to let the subject be overshadowed by talks of the financial crisis .
meanwhile , two other human-rights groups appealed to merkel to use the meetings to address human-rights issues , specifically the situation of china 's tibetan and uighur minorities .
merkel should press china for " tangible results from the dialogue between the dalai lama 's representatives and chinese officials , " kate saunders , communications director of the international campaign for tibet , told dpa press agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's 2007 meeting with the dalai lama shook china relations and a european-based group representing china 's mainly muslim uighur urged the german leader to press china to allow international investigation of claims that uighurs were involved in several plots to attack the beijing olympic games in august .
relations back to normal after dalai lama visit thomas steg , a deputy spokesman for merkel , told dpa that the chancellor would indeed raise human rights issues during her china visit .
" she 'll bring it up , " he said .
ruprecht polenz , a foreign affairs spokesman for merkel 's party , the christian democratic union , insisted that china-germany relations were back to normal after beijing 's displeasure at merkel meeting in her office last year with the dalai lama .
but polenz , who chairs the parliamentary committee on foreign policy , acknowledged that " human rights remain a problem issue . "
he called on beijing to grant greater autonomy to tibet . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" to issue an award to such a criminal amounts to interference in china 's judicial sovereignty and is totally against the purpose of this prize , " said government spokesman qin gang . the sakharov award announcement comes just one day ahead of an asia-europe summit , but qin declined to say whether hu 's recognition would have a negative impact on the talks . uncovering a ' state secret ' hu 's activism began in the late 1990s when the economics graduate volunteered to work on environmental projects . in 2001 , he began helping villagers infected with hiv / aids through blood-selling schemes in the central province of henan .

" state security police threatened us and said that aids was a state secret , " he said . hu said he believes that china was " lucky " to be shaken out of its complacency on aids by the scandal over a cover-up of hundreds of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- in beijing . " after sars in 2003 , nobody dared to say that aids was a state secret any more , " hu said .

before his formal arrest in late december , hu had spent most of the previous two years under virtual house arrest or other forms of detention . he used his enforced isolation to act as a bridge between foreign media and the growing number of rights activists across the country , collecting and disseminating information on rights cases and other issues in china via the internet and telephone . in november , he and his wife zeng jinyan managed to testify in a telephone call to the european parliamentary hearing on the rights situation in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nelson mandela was the first recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize in 1988 despite appeals from the european union , the united states and rights groups for his release , a beijing court in april sentenced hu to three and a half years in prison for " inciting subversion of state power " after a one-day trial . the sakharov prize , in its 20th year , is named for the soviet dissident andrei sakharov , who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1975 .

coinciding with the release , a german university is investigating the trauma of the victims . the movie picks up a story long neglected in german post-war history : the plight of rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii .
" a woman in berlin " premiered at septembers ' film festival in toronto and is being released in theaters across germany on thursday , oct .
23 .
the movie is based on the autobiographical account of marta hiller , a young woman in berlin between the months of april and june in 1945 .
when the book was published anonymously in the 1950s , reactions were overwhelmingly negative .
from flop to bestseller a republished edition hit the shelves only as late as 2003 - - two years after hiller 's death - - and proved to be a bestseller .

she 's raped several times by red army soldiers until she eventually enters into a relationship with a russian officer to shield herself from further attacks .
rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii have long been a difficult chapter in german history , especially in communist east germany , where any criticism of the russian army was impossible .
" for the first time the phenomenon of mass rapes at the end of the war is the subject of a german movie , " said jochen-konrad fromme , a german parliamentarian and a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .

cases of sexual violence also occurred in the western part of germany under the allied forces , yet historians agree that the problem was particularly acute under the soviet army .
coinciding with the release of the movie , the university of greifswald in northeastern germany has launched a research project to study the trauma of women raped during that period .
phillip kuwert , who is heading the project , said that it will help to analyze the long-term psychological effects .
better methods of treatment could then be developed for other conflict or war zones .
german newspapers have reacted with mixed reviews to " a woman in berlin . "

coinciding with the release , a german university is investigating the trauma of the victims . the movie picks up a story long neglected in german post-war history : the plight of rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii .
" a woman in berlin " premiered at septembers ' film festival in toronto and is being released in theaters across germany on thursday , oct .
23 .
the movie is based on the autobiographical account of marta hiller , a young woman in berlin between the months of april and june in 1945 .
when the book was published anonymously in the 1950s , reactions were overwhelmingly negative .
from flop to bestseller a republished edition hit the shelves only as late as 2003 - - two years after hiller 's death - - and proved to be a bestseller .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their men gone , women were left to pick up the pieces the lead role is portrayed by german actress nina hoss , playing the young woman as soviet soldiers entered berlin in may 1945 .
she 's raped several times by red army soldiers until she eventually enters into a relationship with a russian officer to shield herself from further attacks .
rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii have long been a difficult chapter in german history , especially in communist east germany , where any criticism of the russian army was impossible .
" for the first time the phenomenon of mass rapes at the end of the war is the subject of a german movie , " said jochen-konrad fromme , a german parliamentarian and a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that means that 63 years after the end of the war , the fate and suffering of hundreds of thousands of german women is being acknowledged for the first time , " he added .
millions of victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress nina hoss says her character ' went through hell ' fromme added that historians estimate around 2 million women became victims of rape after the war .
cases of sexual violence also occurred in the western part of germany under the allied forces , yet historians agree that the problem was particularly acute under the soviet army .
coinciding with the release of the movie , the university of greifswald in northeastern germany has launched a research project to study the trauma of women raped during that period .
phillip kuwert , who is heading the project , said that it will help to analyze the long-term psychological effects .
better methods of treatment could then be developed for other conflict or war zones .
german newspapers have reacted with mixed reviews to " a woman in berlin . "
some critics are bashing the filmmakers for treating the serious subject on a level way too trivial and sentimental .
others praise the movie for bringing a chapter of german history to a wider audience which so far many people have been ill-informed about . dw staff -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this week 's education summit missed the mark , says dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen . unfortunately , the politicians at the education summit in dresden on wednesday , oct .
22 , did n't present any solutions that fit the problem .
education is often a topic that gets politicians on their soap boxes .
but at the summit , the issue was once again used as a means to boost their political images .
the result was nothing more than expressions of good intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen " education should be top priority in germany , " they concluded .
yes , but was n't it top priority before ?
in dresden , state and federal delegations agreed to halve the number of high school and college dropouts .
that 's been called for many times , but changes have yet to be seen .
the state and federal governments have also said they want to increase the education budget by 10 percent by the year 2015 .
that sounds good - but no one has said how they plan to reach this goal .
money for banks , not for education it 's amazing that it is possible to decide on a billion-euro rescue package for the troubled finance industry in just a few days , but that it is apparently unfeasible to agree on financing germany 's most important resource - education .
what was announced on wednesday was merely symbolic : " look , we 've made it top priority ; we 'll take care of it . "
that sounds good , especially ahead of an election year in the federal parliament as well as several state governments .
after all , a committee was established to figure out how the ambitious goals can be financed .
but there wo n't be any results until after the 2009 bundestag election .
delay instead of action , that 's the motto .
' education for all ' still just a dream once again , the main problems with the german education system were n't addressed .
it 's a disaster that , in a wealthy country like germany , parents ' bank accounts still determine their children 's education options .
former chancellor willy brandt 's appeal in the 1970s for " education for all " has never been fulfilled .
the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school and the working class child goes to the third-tier tech school - that 's still often the case .
children with so-called non-academic backgrounds or from immigrant families are n't challenged enough and their potential goes unrecognized .
germany 's education budget is well below the average of many other industrial countries .
particularly in the elementary schools , much less is invested per child than elsewhere .
germany is the only country in the world that demands several hundred euros a month from young parents so their child can attend pre-school .
education path determined too early furthermore , in no other country does the selection process - the sorting of children into various types of schools - begin so early .
a pupil 's educational path is decided after the fourth grade .
the familiar learning environment , where children learn well and yet differentiated , gets lost . nearly all german education experts agree that the solution is for pupils to spend more time learning together in a positive environment , without pressure to perform .
but in dresden , concrete steps and strategies were n't discussed .
chancellor angela merkel praised wednesday 's resolutions as an important step toward an " education republic of germany . "

but this week 's education summit missed the mark , says dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen . unfortunately , the politicians at the education summit in dresden on wednesday , oct .
22 , did n't present any solutions that fit the problem .
education is often a topic that gets politicians on their soap boxes .
but at the summit , the issue was once again used as a means to boost their political images .
the result was nothing more than expressions of good intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen " education should be top priority in germany , " they concluded .
yes , but was n't it top priority before ?
in dresden , state and federal delegations agreed to halve the number of high school and college dropouts .
that 's been called for many times , but changes have yet to be seen .
the state and federal governments have also said they want to increase the education budget by 10 percent by the year 2015 .
that sounds good - but no one has said how they plan to reach this goal .
money for banks , not for education it 's amazing that it is possible to decide on a billion-euro rescue package for the troubled finance industry in just a few days , but that it is apparently unfeasible to agree on financing germany 's most important resource - education .
what was announced on wednesday was merely symbolic : " look , we 've made it top priority ; we 'll take care of it . "
that sounds good , especially ahead of an election year in the federal parliament as well as several state governments .
after all , a committee was established to figure out how the ambitious goals can be financed .
but there wo n't be any results until after the 2009 bundestag election .
delay instead of action , that 's the motto .
' education for all ' still just a dream once again , the main problems with the german education system were n't addressed .
it 's a disaster that , in a wealthy country like germany , parents ' bank accounts still determine their children 's education options .
former chancellor willy brandt 's appeal in the 1970s for " education for all " has never been fulfilled .
the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school and the working class child goes to the third-tier tech school - that 's still often the case .
children with so-called non-academic backgrounds or from immigrant families are n't challenged enough and their potential goes unrecognized .
germany 's education budget is well below the average of many other industrial countries .
particularly in the elementary schools , much less is invested per child than elsewhere .
germany is the only country in the world that demands several hundred euros a month from young parents so their child can attend pre-school .
education path determined too early furthermore , in no other country does the selection process - the sorting of children into various types of schools - begin so early .
a pupil 's educational path is decided after the fourth grade .
the familiar learning environment , where children learn well and yet differentiated , gets lost . nearly all german education experts agree that the solution is for pupils to spend more time learning together in a positive environment , without pressure to perform .
but in dresden , concrete steps and strategies were n't discussed .
chancellor angela merkel praised wednesday 's resolutions as an important step toward an " education republic of germany . "
but , as one newspaper commented , the " education illusion of germany " would be a more appropriate term .

" we need a coordinated global response to reform the global financial system .
we are living in unprecedented times , and we need unprecedented levels of global coordination , " barroso told reporters in beijing .
" i very much hope that china gives an important contribution to the solution of this financial crisis . it 's a great opportunity for china to show a sense of responsibility , " he said . " it 's very simple : we sink together or we swim together . "
" we need asia on board " barroso 's comments came ahead of a two-day summit in beijing of the 27 eu member states and 16 asian countries covering the global downturn , climate change and international security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese investors too are an anxious lot nowadays outlining the " unprecedented " challenges facing the global economy , under threat of a looming worldwide recession , barroso said : " we need asia to be on board , and more particularly countries like china , india -lrb- and -rrb- japan . " french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the european union , has already said he would use the asem summit to seek asian backing for his bid to rebuild the world 's financial system . european governments have already committed more than two trillion dollars to help bail out struggling banks and shore up plummeting stock markets in largely coordinated actions . unlike in europe , asian banks have not responded to the crisis with coordinated action , but rather have focused on cutting interest rates , guaranteeing bank deposits and injecting money into credit markets . " the present gathering could not be more timely .
we face challenges which do n't respect any borders , " barroso said . " no one in europe or asia can seriously pretend to be immune .
we are living in unprecedented times , and we need unprecedented levels of global coordination . " barroso says china could enjoy greater influence barroso also hinted that in return beijing could be given greater clout on the world financial stage . china this year won a modest increase in its voting power at the international monetary fund but argues that it is still not being given adequate leverage as the world 's fourth-largest economy and the one that is growing fastest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , right , and barroso want china to step up to the plate on financial reforms " we think china could and should have a greater voice in international financial institutions , " barroso said in a speech at a school for civil servants .
china is among the group of 20 industrial and emerging nations that us president george w. bush invited to a finance summit in washington on nov .
15 .
more concrete internationally coordinated action is expected to come out of the washington conference that friday and saturday 's asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- in beijing .
merkel affirms economic ties to china speaking to reporters in beijing after meeting chinese premier wen jiabao , german chancellor angela merkel said on thursday that " cooperation with china is of utmost importance " for germany .
" it is important to bring china into a new financial system , " she said , adding that china was already making efforts .
" with china 's strong economic growth , china by itself is already making a contribution , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic issues dominate merkel 's visit to china in a speech ahead of his talks with merkel , wen said cooperation with germany was " extremely important " and that china " counts on investment from germany . "
german officials said the fact that merkel was one of the few foreign leaders making a formal state visit to china for the asem summit showed the importance of ties between the two nations .
chancellor defends jailed chinese activist merkel , who was scheduled to meet president hu jintao friday , said she raised human rights issues , including the situation of china 's tibetan and uighur minorities , during her talks , adding that germany wanted to continue dialogue with china on human rights .
she welcomed thursday 's award of the eu 's sakharov prize for human rights to recently jailed chinese dissident hu jia .
" the german government has always called for the release of hu jia and will continue to do so , " she said , adding that she did n't expect the issue to cast a cloud over the asem summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's human rights award for hu jia has irked the chinese government china expressed anger at the decision to award the prize to hu , 35 , who was imprisoned for three-and-a-half years in april on subversion charges . " this is gross interference in china 's domestic affairs , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . but experts say the incident is unlikely to seriously mar the summit or strain ties between china and the eu .
" the fact is , in spite of all the political irritation and debates in the last few months about the dalai lama and the olympics , the significance of bilateral economic relations between germany and china or europe and china was never denied by anyone , " eberhard sandschneider , research director at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this week 's education summit missed the mark , says dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen . unfortunately , the politicians at the education summit in dresden on wednesday , oct .
22 , did n't present any solutions that fit the problem .
education is often a topic that gets politicians on their soap boxes .
but at the summit , the issue was once again used as a means to boost their political images .
the result was nothing more than expressions of good intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen " education should be top priority in germany , " they concluded .
yes , but was n't it top priority before ?
in dresden , state and federal delegations agreed to halve the number of high school and college dropouts .
that 's been called for many times , but changes have yet to be seen .
the state and federal governments have also said they want to increase the education budget by 10 percent by the year 2015 .
that sounds good - but no one has said how they plan to reach this goal .
money for banks , not for education it 's amazing that it is possible to decide on a billion-euro rescue package for the troubled finance industry in just a few days , but that it is apparently unfeasible to agree on financing germany 's most important resource - education .
what was announced on wednesday was merely symbolic : " look , we 've made it top priority ; we 'll take care of it . "
that sounds good , especially ahead of an election year in the federal parliament as well as several state governments .
after all , a committee was established to figure out how the ambitious goals can be financed .
but there wo n't be any results until after the 2009 bundestag election .
delay instead of action , that 's the motto .
' education for all ' still just a dream once again , the main problems with the german education system were n't addressed .
it 's a disaster that , in a wealthy country like germany , parents ' bank accounts still determine their children 's education options .
former chancellor willy brandt 's appeal in the 1970s for " education for all " has never been fulfilled .
the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school and the working class child goes to the third-tier tech school - that 's still often the case .
children with so-called non-academic backgrounds or from immigrant families are n't challenged enough and their potential goes unrecognized .
germany 's education budget is well below the average of many other industrial countries .
particularly in the elementary schools , much less is invested per child than elsewhere .
germany is the only country in the world that demands several hundred euros a month from young parents so their child can attend pre-school .
education path determined too early furthermore , in no other country does the selection process - the sorting of children into various types of schools - begin so early .
a pupil 's educational path is decided after the fourth grade .
the familiar learning environment , where children learn well and yet differentiated , gets lost . nearly all german education experts agree that the solution is for pupils to spend more time learning together in a positive environment , without pressure to perform .
but in dresden , concrete steps and strategies were n't discussed .
chancellor angela merkel praised wednesday 's resolutions as an important step toward an " education republic of germany . "
but , as one newspaper commented , the " education illusion of germany " would be a more appropriate term .

22 , several advisors to the french president have confirmed this strategy .
sarkozy 's ambition is based on his firm conviction that the crisis in georgia and the financial crisis both demonstrated that europe was in need of a strong leader .
according to le monde , sarkozy believes that without such an individual at the helm , the eu would never have been able to negotiate with moscow or decide on an effective plan to rescue european banks .
in addition , with ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty , there will be no stable presidency of the eu , elected for a period of 30 months , as the treaty had foreseen .
next eu presidencies not in euro zone as a result , the eu will be led by the euro-skeptic czech president vaclav klaus and his prime minister , mirek topolanek , beginning on jan .
1 , 2009 , with the prague government fighting for survival after a landslide defeat in recent regional elections .
in july 2009 , the eu will be headed by sweden , which - like the czechs - does not use the single currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next two eu presidency holders are outside the euro zone to avoid what he foresees as a paralysis in the eu , sarkozy sees the soon-to-be 16-member euro zone as an effective alternative , as it was on oct .
12 , when euro zone leaders formulated the european bank rescue plan at a summit in paris convened by the french president .
in a speech before eu parliamentarians in strasbourg on tuesday , sarkozy said that " a meeting of -lrb- eu -rrb- finance ministers is not up to dealing with the crisis . "
german minister rejects joint economic governance only heads of state and government " have the democratic legitimacy " to decide such wide-ranging measures as the bank rescue plan , he said in strasbourg .
since the eurogroup has no legal existence , a euro zone president could be elected without resorting to a constitution .
or a decision could be taken to allow france - that is , sarkozy - to continue in a leadership position until the eu presidency reverts to a country that uses the euro , which would be spain in january 2010 .
however , it seems unlikely that other eu countries will go along with the idea .
in an interview published wednesday in the french business daily la tribune , german economics minister michael glos said the proposal of a single economic governance of euro zone countries was " not suitable for resolving the current problems . "
the problems of individual eu member nations were diverse , he said , and the majority of economic policies should remain national decisions . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at least for now .
the little fish , also known as salomon ugborugo , was the head of the ivory coast company , which in 2006 agreed to dispose of 500 tons of liquid waste for the big fish - - otherwise known as dutch multinational firm trafigura . ugborugo 's company did get rid of the waste .
the problem was , they did so without treating it , and the resulting fumes killed an estimated 17 people and have made an estimated 100,000 people in abidjan ill . now , for his role ugborugo is looking at 20 years behind bars .
his partner at the city ’ s port will get 5 years .
ugborugo 's lawyer says he 's appalled by the verdict . " the element of intention was clearly missing .
i would have understood if he was only condemned of involuntary homicide . "
the lawyer insists that his client hadn ’ t been aware that the waste was so dangerous . who is to blame ?
the trail leads to the netherlands it ’ s hard to say how much ugborugo actually knew about the dangerous load his company was dumping . but either way , if you follow the story back up the food chain , it doesn ’ t take long to get back to the netherlands-based trafigura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the clearing efforts , much of the toxic waste is still polluting the area marietta harjono from green peace international , says she hopes the buck doesn ’ t just stop with ugborugo .
" trafigura is a big , multi-billion dollar oil company , " she says .
" the only goal is to make as much money as possible . " trafigura had tried to dispose of the waste in amsterdam , hiding the fact that it was toxic .
but once the truth came out , the tanker full of toxic liquid shipped off to africa , hoping to bypass the hundreds of thousands euros it would have cost to safely treat the material . and that ’ s when the trafigura story merged with ugborugo ’ s . 200 million to avoid a lawsuit when it became clear what had made people sick in abidjan , trafigura paid ivory coast more than $ 200 million to avoid a lawsuit in the west african country .
it seems like a lot , but that amount could be peanuts compared to what the disaster has actually cost ivory coast in terms of health care and environmental clean up costs . with that in mind the netherlands has announced it ’ s suing trafigura for illegal dumping practices and a law firm in england has agreed to bring a suit against the company on behalf of 30,000 plaintiffs affected by the waste in abidjan .
unfortunately for the residents of abidjan , regardless of the outcomes in the courts , the nightmare continues , with much of the toxic waste still polluting the air . eric heath -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the little fish , also known as salomon ugborugo , was the head of the ivory coast company , which in 2006 agreed to dispose of 500 tons of liquid waste for the big fish - - otherwise known as dutch multinational firm trafigura . ugborugo 's company did get rid of the waste .
the problem was , they did so without treating it , and the resulting fumes killed an estimated 17 people and have made an estimated 100,000 people in abidjan ill . now , for his role ugborugo is looking at 20 years behind bars .
his partner at the city ’ s port will get 5 years .
ugborugo 's lawyer says he 's appalled by the verdict . " the element of intention was clearly missing .
i would have understood if he was only condemned of involuntary homicide . "
the lawyer insists that his client hadn ’ t been aware that the waste was so dangerous . who is to blame ?
the trail leads to the netherlands it ’ s hard to say how much ugborugo actually knew about the dangerous load his company was dumping . but either way , if you follow the story back up the food chain , it doesn ’ t take long to get back to the netherlands-based trafigura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the clearing efforts , much of the toxic waste is still polluting the area marietta harjono from green peace international , says she hopes the buck doesn ’ t just stop with ugborugo .
" trafigura is a big , multi-billion dollar oil company , " she says .
" the only goal is to make as much money as possible . " trafigura had tried to dispose of the waste in amsterdam , hiding the fact that it was toxic .
but once the truth came out , the tanker full of toxic liquid shipped off to africa , hoping to bypass the hundreds of thousands euros it would have cost to safely treat the material . and that ’ s when the trafigura story merged with ugborugo ’ s . 200 million to avoid a lawsuit when it became clear what had made people sick in abidjan , trafigura paid ivory coast more than $ 200 million to avoid a lawsuit in the west african country .
it seems like a lot , but that amount could be peanuts compared to what the disaster has actually cost ivory coast in terms of health care and environmental clean up costs . with that in mind the netherlands has announced it ’ s suing trafigura for illegal dumping practices and a law firm in england has agreed to bring a suit against the company on behalf of 30,000 plaintiffs affected by the waste in abidjan .

" large french companies ca n't be allowed to fall into foreign hands just because we do n't react to the financial crisis , " sarkozy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says the financial crisis underlines the need for governments to intervene in the economy earlier this week , sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , stirred debate in the european parliament with his plan to partially nationalize key industries with the help of state funds . sarkozy argued that the sovereign wealth fund would help to prevent countries such as china and other gulf nations taking over large european companies by using current stock plunges to buy up shares in eu firms . " i do n't want european citizens to wake up in a few months and discover that european companies belong to non-european capitals , " he said . germany resists plan germany , which last week passed a 500-million-euro rescue package for its troubled banks , reacted sharply to the french proposal on thursday , saying saying any measures must be compatible with european union rules . " the german government believes that ... greater protection measures are not needed in germany , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
" it is also convinced that measures to protect against foreign takeovers must be compatible with -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market rules . " german chancellor angela merkel will discuss sarkozy 's idea with him on the sidelines of a two-day summit of european and asian countries beginning in beijing on friday , wilhelm said in a statement . earlier this week , german economy minister michael glos too dismissed the french plan . " the french proposal that the state should take stakes in european industry so as to protect it from foreign state takeover goes against the successful principles of our economic policy , " glos said . " current state intervention in the banking and insurance sector are an indispensable exception so as to prevent a possible breakdown of financial flows and help protect jobs and growth , " glos said . sarkozy vows more state investment in addition to the sovereign wealth fund , sarkozy unveiled measures to stimulate the french economy . his administration plans to scrap corporate tax on new investments until 2010 and inject 175 billion euros in infrastructure . " in the past 20 years , france has lagged in infrastructure , " sarkozy said , adding that investments were needed in new energies , universities and public transportation . " governments have to become more active in the economy , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.10.2008 two jailed in ivory coast in dutch toxic dumping scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ivorian man in an oxygen mask in abijhan where toxic waste was dumped a court in ivory coast jailed two people over a deadly 2006 dumping of toxic waste which killed at least 17 people and poisoned thousands after a dutch firm paid an african company to dispose 500 tons of toxic liquid . it 's a case of catching the little fish while watching the big fish wriggle away .
at least for now .
the little fish , also known as salomon ugborugo , was the head of the ivory coast company , which in 2006 agreed to dispose of 500 tons of liquid waste for the big fish - - otherwise known as dutch multinational firm trafigura . ugborugo 's company did get rid of the waste .
the problem was , they did so without treating it , and the resulting fumes killed an estimated 17 people and have made an estimated 100,000 people in abidjan ill . now , for his role ugborugo is looking at 20 years behind bars .
his partner at the city ’ s port will get 5 years .
ugborugo 's lawyer says he 's appalled by the verdict . " the element of intention was clearly missing .
i would have understood if he was only condemned of involuntary homicide . "
the lawyer insists that his client hadn ’ t been aware that the waste was so dangerous . who is to blame ?
the trail leads to the netherlands it ’ s hard to say how much ugborugo actually knew about the dangerous load his company was dumping . but either way , if you follow the story back up the food chain , it doesn ’ t take long to get back to the netherlands-based trafigura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the clearing efforts , much of the toxic waste is still polluting the area marietta harjono from green peace international , says she hopes the buck doesn ’ t just stop with ugborugo .
" trafigura is a big , multi-billion dollar oil company , " she says .
" the only goal is to make as much money as possible . " trafigura had tried to dispose of the waste in amsterdam , hiding the fact that it was toxic .
but once the truth came out , the tanker full of toxic liquid shipped off to africa , hoping to bypass the hundreds of thousands euros it would have cost to safely treat the material . and that ’ s when the trafigura story merged with ugborugo ’ s . 200 million to avoid a lawsuit when it became clear what had made people sick in abidjan , trafigura paid ivory coast more than $ 200 million to avoid a lawsuit in the west african country .
it seems like a lot , but that amount could be peanuts compared to what the disaster has actually cost ivory coast in terms of health care and environmental clean up costs . with that in mind the netherlands has announced it ’ s suing trafigura for illegal dumping practices and a law firm in england has agreed to bring a suit against the company on behalf of 30,000 plaintiffs affected by the waste in abidjan .
unfortunately for the residents of abidjan , regardless of the outcomes in the courts , the nightmare continues , with much of the toxic waste still polluting the air . eric heath -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it provides information about the fate of jews in national-socialist germany , their place of birth , their place of residence and about whether and when they left germany or when they were murdered , " franka kuehn , spokeswoman for the german foundation for remembrance , responsibility and future , which initiated the research project , told deutsche welle .
on thursday , oct .
23 , german culture minister bernd neumann and martin salm , the head of the foundation , officially lodged the list at yad vashem .
though the israeli memorial site has a huge database of its own , the german contribution is a valuable addition because it is based on over 1,000 sources - more than ever used at one time .
long-drawn out process kuehn said that several terminology issues had to be sorted out during the research process , as it was n't always clear who was a jew and who was n't .
the nazis ' own records of jews contained people who may have only sympathized with the jews and were therefore also persecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many holocaust victims were transported to death camps by train " the term jew had a racist connotation during the time of national socialism , " said kuehn .
one might ask whether golo mann -lrb- son of german writer thomas mann -rrb- would have wanted to see his name on a list of german jews , but it 's not our job as a foundation to answer these kinds of questions . "
the study follows a 1986 compilation , revised in 2005 , of the names of the 150,000 german jews killed in the holocaust .
a greater number of german jews managed to flee .
the nazis killed an estimated 6 million jews in europe .
the german foundation for remembrance , responsibility and future was founded in 2002 to organize compensation payments to forced laborers under the nazi regime .
by the end of 2007 , the foundation had disbursed 4.37 billion euros from german industries and the state to more than 1.5 million people in 98 countries . dw staff -lrb- hg / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , said china should have more say in international financial institutions , but also urged beijing to play its part in helping to resolve the global financial crisis .
" we need a coordinated global response to reform the global financial system .
we are living in unprecedented times , and we need unprecedented levels of global coordination , " barroso told reporters in beijing .
" i very much hope that china gives an important contribution to the solution of this financial crisis . it 's a great opportunity for china to show a sense of responsibility , " he said . " it 's very simple : we sink together or we swim together . "
" we need asia on board " barroso 's comments came ahead of a two-day summit in beijing of the 27 eu member states and 16 asian countries covering the global downturn , climate change and international security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese investors too are an anxious lot nowadays outlining the " unprecedented " challenges facing the global economy , under threat of a looming worldwide recession , barroso said : " we need asia to be on board , and more particularly countries like china , india -lrb- and -rrb- japan . " french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the european union , has already said he would use the asem summit to seek asian backing for his bid to rebuild the world 's financial system . european governments have already committed more than two trillion dollars to help bail out struggling banks and shore up plummeting stock markets in largely coordinated actions . unlike in europe , asian banks have not responded to the crisis with coordinated action , but rather have focused on cutting interest rates , guaranteeing bank deposits and injecting money into credit markets . " the present gathering could not be more timely .
we face challenges which do n't respect any borders , " barroso said . " no one in europe or asia can seriously pretend to be immune .
we are living in unprecedented times , and we need unprecedented levels of global coordination . " barroso says china could enjoy greater influence barroso also hinted that in return beijing could be given greater clout on the world financial stage . china this year won a modest increase in its voting power at the international monetary fund but argues that it is still not being given adequate leverage as the world 's fourth-largest economy and the one that is growing fastest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , right , and barroso want china to step up to the plate on financial reforms " we think china could and should have a greater voice in international financial institutions , " barroso said in a speech at a school for civil servants .
china is among the group of 20 industrial and emerging nations that us president george w. bush invited to a finance summit in washington on nov .
15 .
more concrete internationally coordinated action is expected to come out of the washington conference that friday and saturday 's asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- in beijing .
merkel affirms economic ties to china speaking to reporters in beijing after meeting chinese premier wen jiabao , german chancellor angela merkel said on thursday that " cooperation with china is of utmost importance " for germany .
" it is important to bring china into a new financial system , " she said , adding that china was already making efforts .
" with china 's strong economic growth , china by itself is already making a contribution , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic issues dominate merkel 's visit to china in a speech ahead of his talks with merkel , wen said cooperation with germany was " extremely important " and that china " counts on investment from germany . "
german officials said the fact that merkel was one of the few foreign leaders making a formal state visit to china for the asem summit showed the importance of ties between the two nations .
chancellor defends jailed chinese activist merkel , who was scheduled to meet president hu jintao friday , said she raised human rights issues , including the situation of china 's tibetan and uighur minorities , during her talks , adding that germany wanted to continue dialogue with china on human rights .
she welcomed thursday 's award of the eu 's sakharov prize for human rights to recently jailed chinese dissident hu jia .
" the german government has always called for the release of hu jia and will continue to do so , " she said , adding that she did n't expect the issue to cast a cloud over the asem summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's human rights award for hu jia has irked the chinese government china expressed anger at the decision to award the prize to hu , 35 , who was imprisoned for three-and-a-half years in april on subversion charges . " this is gross interference in china 's domestic affairs , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . but experts say the incident is unlikely to seriously mar the summit or strain ties between china and the eu .
" the fact is , in spite of all the political irritation and debates in the last few months about the dalai lama and the olympics , the significance of bilateral economic relations between germany and china or europe and china was never denied by anyone , " eberhard sandschneider , research director at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government forecasts annual growth this year of 1.7 percent , owing to an exceptionally dynamic first quarter , but recently slashed its estimate for 2009 to just 0.2 percent .
third-quarter figures are expected in mid-november , but officials have warned gross domestic product would probably be " almost unchanged " from the second quarter , when it contracted by 0.5 percent .

saying that the scanners " have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens " , the lawmakers voted on a non-binding resolution asking the bloc 's executive european commission to carry out an economic , medical and human rights assessment of the impact of using full-body scanners .
body scanners use radio waves to display full-body images that reveal whether passengers are concealing weapons or explosives under their clothes .
the commission proposed last month that the scanners be added to a list of security measures that can be used at airports in the 27-country bloc .
the eu commission says the proposal is meant to harmonize the conditions in which they can be operated .
the scanners are already in use at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports to speed up security checks and to avoid hand-frisking passengers .

saying that the scanners " have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens " , the lawmakers voted on a non-binding resolution asking the bloc 's executive european commission to carry out an economic , medical and human rights assessment of the impact of using full-body scanners .
body scanners use radio waves to display full-body images that reveal whether passengers are concealing weapons or explosives under their clothes .
the commission proposed last month that the scanners be added to a list of security measures that can be used at airports in the 27-country bloc .
the eu commission says the proposal is meant to harmonize the conditions in which they can be operated .
the scanners are already in use at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports to speed up security checks and to avoid hand-frisking passengers .
" a serious breach of fundamental rights " while the european parliament resolution does not call for an outright ban on such scanners , some eu lawmakers said they found them unacceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner is touted as a faster alternative to body searches " i think this is an offense against human dignity .
using this technology does not make us safer , " said the leader of the assembly 's socialist group , martin schulz .
" these devices allow one to see genitals , if a woman has big or small breasts , " said german social democrat lawmaker wolfgang kreissl-doerfler , during debate on the topic .
he said the idea was proof of the " paranoia of interior ministers " when it comes to the question of fighting terrorism .
green mep eva lichtenberger said the machines could be a " serious breach of fundamental rights and the defense of human dignity .
it seems that there is no real effort to see whether they really increase security . "
a voluntary way to speed up security screening european commission spokesman jens mester disagreed , however , saying that fears concerning the eu executive 's proposal were exaggerated .
" the body will indeed be pictured , " he said .
" but the quality is more that of a negative of a photograph , it is not a very clear image but sufficient to detect metal things , explosives or strange objects . "
ahead of the debate , eu transport commissioner antonio tajani likewise insisted that people would not be forced to go through them .
" the body scanner will never be made obligatory .
it 's an alternative to hand searches , " he said , adding that the images " would not be recorded and never stored " on a database .
he said the machines could help shorten security lines at airports , and that personally he found body searches to be more invasive than the machines .

saying that the scanners " have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens " , the lawmakers voted on a non-binding resolution asking the bloc 's executive european commission to carry out an economic , medical and human rights assessment of the impact of using full-body scanners .
body scanners use radio waves to display full-body images that reveal whether passengers are concealing weapons or explosives under their clothes .
the commission proposed last month that the scanners be added to a list of security measures that can be used at airports in the 27-country bloc .
the eu commission says the proposal is meant to harmonize the conditions in which they can be operated .
the scanners are already in use at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports to speed up security checks and to avoid hand-frisking passengers .

he said the idea was proof of the " paranoia of interior ministers " when it comes to the question of fighting terrorism .
green mep eva lichtenberger said the machines could be a " serious breach of fundamental rights and the defense of human dignity .
it seems that there is no real effort to see whether they really increase security . "
a voluntary way to speed up security screening european commission spokesman jens mester disagreed , however , saying that fears concerning the eu executive 's proposal were exaggerated .
" the body will indeed be pictured , " he said .
" but the quality is more that of a negative of a photograph , it is not a very clear image but sufficient to detect metal things , explosives or strange objects . "
ahead of the debate , eu transport commissioner antonio tajani likewise insisted that people would not be forced to go through them .
" the body scanner will never be made obligatory .
it 's an alternative to hand searches , " he said , adding that the images " would not be recorded and never stored " on a database .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 23.10.2008 lawmakers castigate use of full-body scanners at airports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a body scanner in use on a male passenger at amsterdam 's schiphol airport full-body scanners - those that show people 's private parts - amount to a virtual strip search , eu lawmakers decided thursday as concerns about citizens ’ privacy trumped a debate on security . a plan to introduce full-body scanners at airports throughout the eu was voted down by a margin of 361 to 16 with 181 abstentions in the european parliament thursday .
saying that the scanners " have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens " , the lawmakers voted on a non-binding resolution asking the bloc 's executive european commission to carry out an economic , medical and human rights assessment of the impact of using full-body scanners .
body scanners use radio waves to display full-body images that reveal whether passengers are concealing weapons or explosives under their clothes .
the commission proposed last month that the scanners be added to a list of security measures that can be used at airports in the 27-country bloc .
the eu commission says the proposal is meant to harmonize the conditions in which they can be operated .
the scanners are already in use at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports to speed up security checks and to avoid hand-frisking passengers .
" a serious breach of fundamental rights " while the european parliament resolution does not call for an outright ban on such scanners , some eu lawmakers said they found them unacceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanner is touted as a faster alternative to body searches " i think this is an offense against human dignity .
using this technology does not make us safer , " said the leader of the assembly 's socialist group , martin schulz .
" these devices allow one to see genitals , if a woman has big or small breasts , " said german social democrat lawmaker wolfgang kreissl-doerfler , during debate on the topic .
he said the idea was proof of the " paranoia of interior ministers " when it comes to the question of fighting terrorism .
green mep eva lichtenberger said the machines could be a " serious breach of fundamental rights and the defense of human dignity .
it seems that there is no real effort to see whether they really increase security . "

tough times ahead : for the second time in only three months german car giant daimler reduced its expected profit for the next quarter .
the expected annual profit drops from almost 8 down to 6 billion euros . german carmaker daimler ag became the first of the country 's key auto groups to report its third-quarter results , reducing its earnings forecast again in face of deepening economic gloom .
the manufacturer of luxury mercedes-benz vehicles said it now expected to post operating profit in 2008 " of more than 6 billion euros " -lrb- $ 7.67 billion -rrb- .
high energy prices and economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will discounts help to encourage sales ?
daimler chief dieter zetsche had three months previously reduced the group 's 2008 earnings to about 7.0 billion euros from 7.7 billion euros , amid concerns that high energy prices and the prospects of an economic downturn will keep car buyers away from showrooms .
the group 's third-quarter net earnings were 213 million euros , compared with a 1.53-billion-euro loss a year earlier , the company said .
the weak state of the auto business has resulted in analysts expecting the german car sector to begin offering discounts to try to encourage sales .
government aid for the troubled sector ?
germany car industry leaders have also launched a campaign for government aid to help the key export sector to limp through the current financial crisis .
stuttgart-based daimler confirmed last month that it was in talks to finally sever links with troubled us carmaker chrysler , selling off its remaining 19.9-percent stake to the us equity group cerberus capital management lp .
this comes just over a year after cerberus bought an 80.1-percent stake in chrysler from daimler , as the german carmaker moved to end its nine-year troubled relationship with the us vehicle group . dpa news agency -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tough times ahead : for the second time in only three months german car giant daimler reduced its expected profit for the next quarter .
the expected annual profit drops from almost 8 down to 6 billion euros . german carmaker daimler ag became the first of the country 's key auto groups to report its third-quarter results , reducing its earnings forecast again in face of deepening economic gloom .
the manufacturer of luxury mercedes-benz vehicles said it now expected to post operating profit in 2008 " of more than 6 billion euros " -lrb- $ 7.67 billion -rrb- .
high energy prices and economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will discounts help to encourage sales ?
daimler chief dieter zetsche had three months previously reduced the group 's 2008 earnings to about 7.0 billion euros from 7.7 billion euros , amid concerns that high energy prices and the prospects of an economic downturn will keep car buyers away from showrooms .
the group 's third-quarter net earnings were 213 million euros , compared with a 1.53-billion-euro loss a year earlier , the company said .
the weak state of the auto business has resulted in analysts expecting the german car sector to begin offering discounts to try to encourage sales .
government aid for the troubled sector ?
germany car industry leaders have also launched a campaign for government aid to help the key export sector to limp through the current financial crisis .
stuttgart-based daimler confirmed last month that it was in talks to finally sever links with troubled us carmaker chrysler , selling off its remaining 19.9-percent stake to the us equity group cerberus capital management lp .
this comes just over a year after cerberus bought an 80.1-percent stake in chrysler from daimler , as the german carmaker moved to end its nine-year troubled relationship with the us vehicle group . dpa news agency -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it provides information about the fate of jews in national-socialist germany , their place of birth , their place of residence and about whether and when they left germany or when they were murdered , " franka kuehn , spokeswoman for the german foundation for remembrance , responsibility and future , which initiated the research project , told deutsche welle .
on thursday , oct .
23 , german culture minister bernd neumann and martin salm , the head of the foundation , officially lodged the list at yad vashem .
though the israeli memorial site has a huge database of its own , the german contribution is a valuable addition because it is based on over 1,000 sources - more than ever used at one time .
long-drawn out process kuehn said that several terminology issues had to be sorted out during the research process , as it was n't always clear who was a jew and who was n't .
the nazis ' own records of jews contained people who may have only sympathized with the jews and were therefore also persecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many holocaust victims were transported to death camps by train " the term jew had a racist connotation during the time of national socialism , " said kuehn .
one might ask whether golo mann -lrb- son of german writer thomas mann -rrb- would have wanted to see his name on a list of german jews , but it 's not our job as a foundation to answer these kinds of questions . "
the study follows a 1986 compilation , revised in 2005 , of the names of the 150,000 german jews killed in the holocaust .
a greater number of german jews managed to flee .
the nazis killed an estimated 6 million jews in europe .
the german foundation for remembrance , responsibility and future was founded in 2002 to organize compensation payments to forced laborers under the nazi regime .
by the end of 2007 , the foundation had disbursed 4.37 billion euros from german industries and the state to more than 1.5 million people in 98 countries . dw staff -lrb- hg / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in all , the government estimated that german banks had committed between one to five billion euros to investments with lehman brothers . however , spokesmen for the government as well as the insurance companies stressed that the money had not been lost and that it was covered by a fund created by a federation of private german banks . lehman brothers declared bankruptcy on september 15 , the same day that kfw , the german state-owned development bank , transferred more than 300 million euros to it .
that transaction is under investigation .
the government 's letter noted that lehman brothers ' german subsidiary is not officially bankrupt . string of embarrassing financial news but the news is an embarrassing blow to germany , a week after it announced a 500-billion-euro rescue package for its troubled banks and after repeated assurances by lawmakers that its banks were not exposed to the failure of us financial giants . it comes on the heels of a string of damaging revelations at state-owned banks which have been the first to line up to tap the government bailout . on thursday , german news agency dpa cited sources saying michael kemmer , ceo of bavaria 's regional bayern lb bank is to step down following huge losses at the bank , incurred because of its deep involvement he bank in asset-backed securities .
these securities lost much of their value when the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed in 2007 .

former ikb execs also feeling the pain but managers at bayern lb are n't the only ones to be feeling the heat of the financial meltdown .
former executives at german bank ikb have been told to pay back bonuses worth millions of euros that they earned before the bank had to be rescued by the government , a spokesman for the bank said thursday .
the bank , which specializes in corporate loans , has told six bankers to return a total of three million euros -lrb- 3.9 million dollars -rrb- , according to agence france presse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six ikb executives have been told to return bonuses " a new assessment of the bank 's accounts for the period 2006-7 has shown the good financial performances that these bonuses were based to be invalid , " the spokesman told afp .
the executives include former chief executive stefan ortseifen who has been told to pay back 805,000 euros -lrb- 1 million dollars -rrb- .
though he quit in july , he is also being sued by the bank over his actions leading up to a government-led rescue earlier this year .
two others have been told that they have until the end of the month to pay back the money , while a third - reportedly still on ikb 's board - has already returned 558,000 euros -lrb- 730,980 dollars -rrb- .
ikb , which had invested heavily in toxic securities linked to subprime mortgages , became the first big casualty of the subprime crisis in germany .
it had to be rescued with several billion euros of public money in july - the same month in which the bonuses were paid out , according to the daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , several advisors to the french president have confirmed this strategy .
sarkozy 's ambition is based on his firm conviction that the crisis in georgia and the financial crisis both demonstrated that europe was in need of a strong leader .
according to le monde , sarkozy believes that without such an individual at the helm , the eu would never have been able to negotiate with moscow or decide on an effective plan to rescue european banks .
in addition , with ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty , there will be no stable presidency of the eu , elected for a period of 30 months , as the treaty had foreseen .
next eu presidencies not in euro zone as a result , the eu will be led by the euro-skeptic czech president vaclav klaus and his prime minister , mirek topolanek , beginning on jan .
1 , 2009 , with the prague government fighting for survival after a landslide defeat in recent regional elections .
in july 2009 , the eu will be headed by sweden , which - like the czechs - does not use the single currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next two eu presidency holders are outside the euro zone to avoid what he foresees as a paralysis in the eu , sarkozy sees the soon-to-be 16-member euro zone as an effective alternative , as it was on oct .
12 , when euro zone leaders formulated the european bank rescue plan at a summit in paris convened by the french president .
in a speech before eu parliamentarians in strasbourg on tuesday , sarkozy said that " a meeting of -lrb- eu -rrb- finance ministers is not up to dealing with the crisis . "
german minister rejects joint economic governance only heads of state and government " have the democratic legitimacy " to decide such wide-ranging measures as the bank rescue plan , he said in strasbourg .
since the eurogroup has no legal existence , a euro zone president could be elected without resorting to a constitution .
or a decision could be taken to allow france - that is , sarkozy - to continue in a leadership position until the eu presidency reverts to a country that uses the euro , which would be spain in january 2010 .
however , it seems unlikely that other eu countries will go along with the idea .
in an interview published wednesday in the french business daily la tribune , german economics minister michael glos said the proposal of a single economic governance of euro zone countries was " not suitable for resolving the current problems . "
the problems of individual eu member nations were diverse , he said , and the majority of economic policies should remain national decisions . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or a decision could be taken to allow france - that is , sarkozy - to continue in a leadership position until the eu presidency reverts to a country that uses the euro , which would be spain in january 2010 .
however , it seems unlikely that other eu countries will go along with the idea .
in an interview published wednesday in the french business daily la tribune , german economics minister michael glos said the proposal of a single economic governance of euro zone countries was " not suitable for resolving the current problems . "
the problems of individual eu member nations were diverse , he said , and the majority of economic policies should remain national decisions . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in all , the government estimated that german banks had committed between one to five billion euros to investments with lehman brothers . however , spokesmen for the government as well as the insurance companies stressed that the money had not been lost and that it was covered by a fund created by a federation of private german banks . lehman brothers declared bankruptcy on september 15 , the same day that kfw , the german state-owned development bank , transferred more than 300 million euros to it .
that transaction is under investigation .
the government 's letter noted that lehman brothers ' german subsidiary is not officially bankrupt . string of embarrassing financial news but the news is an embarrassing blow to germany , a week after it announced a 500-billion-euro rescue package for its troubled banks and after repeated assurances by lawmakers that its banks were not exposed to the failure of us financial giants . it comes on the heels of a string of damaging revelations at state-owned banks which have been the first to line up to tap the government bailout . on thursday , german news agency dpa cited sources saying michael kemmer , ceo of bavaria 's regional bayern lb bank is to step down following huge losses at the bank , incurred because of its deep involvement he bank in asset-backed securities .
these securities lost much of their value when the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed in 2007 .
as the bank was recovering from this loss , it was hit a second time when interbank loans dried up in mid-september . reports of kemmer 's resignation come just one day after bavarian finance minister and head of bayernlb 's supervisory board erwin huber said he was quitting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rumor comes on the heels of the bavarian finance minister 's departure bayernlb became the first german financial house to apply for aid this week when it asked for 5.4 billion euros from berlin 's bank rescue plan . bayernlb also announced wednesday it was launching a review of all its costs , including the the bank 's 19,000 world-wide labor force with the bank having already warned that it might not be able to avoid job cuts .
former ikb execs also feeling the pain but managers at bayern lb are n't the only ones to be feeling the heat of the financial meltdown .
former executives at german bank ikb have been told to pay back bonuses worth millions of euros that they earned before the bank had to be rescued by the government , a spokesman for the bank said thursday .
the bank , which specializes in corporate loans , has told six bankers to return a total of three million euros -lrb- 3.9 million dollars -rrb- , according to agence france presse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six ikb executives have been told to return bonuses " a new assessment of the bank 's accounts for the period 2006-7 has shown the good financial performances that these bonuses were based to be invalid , " the spokesman told afp .
the executives include former chief executive stefan ortseifen who has been told to pay back 805,000 euros -lrb- 1 million dollars -rrb- .
though he quit in july , he is also being sued by the bank over his actions leading up to a government-led rescue earlier this year .
two others have been told that they have until the end of the month to pay back the money , while a third - reportedly still on ikb 's board - has already returned 558,000 euros -lrb- 730,980 dollars -rrb- .
ikb , which had invested heavily in toxic securities linked to subprime mortgages , became the first big casualty of the subprime crisis in germany .

but this week 's education summit missed the mark , says dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen . unfortunately , the politicians at the education summit in dresden on wednesday , oct .
22 , did n't present any solutions that fit the problem .
education is often a topic that gets politicians on their soap boxes .
but at the summit , the issue was once again used as a means to boost their political images .
the result was nothing more than expressions of good intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen " education should be top priority in germany , " they concluded .
yes , but was n't it top priority before ?
in dresden , state and federal delegations agreed to halve the number of high school and college dropouts .
that 's been called for many times , but changes have yet to be seen .
the state and federal governments have also said they want to increase the education budget by 10 percent by the year 2015 .
that sounds good - but no one has said how they plan to reach this goal .
money for banks , not for education it 's amazing that it is possible to decide on a billion-euro rescue package for the troubled finance industry in just a few days , but that it is apparently unfeasible to agree on financing germany 's most important resource - education .
what was announced on wednesday was merely symbolic : " look , we 've made it top priority ; we 'll take care of it . "
that sounds good , especially ahead of an election year in the federal parliament as well as several state governments .
after all , a committee was established to figure out how the ambitious goals can be financed .
but there wo n't be any results until after the 2009 bundestag election .
delay instead of action , that 's the motto .
' education for all ' still just a dream once again , the main problems with the german education system were n't addressed .
it 's a disaster that , in a wealthy country like germany , parents ' bank accounts still determine their children 's education options .
former chancellor willy brandt 's appeal in the 1970s for " education for all " has never been fulfilled .
the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school and the working class child goes to the third-tier tech school - that 's still often the case .
children with so-called non-academic backgrounds or from immigrant families are n't challenged enough and their potential goes unrecognized .
germany 's education budget is well below the average of many other industrial countries .
particularly in the elementary schools , much less is invested per child than elsewhere .

but this week 's education summit missed the mark , says dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen . unfortunately , the politicians at the education summit in dresden on wednesday , oct .
22 , did n't present any solutions that fit the problem .
education is often a topic that gets politicians on their soap boxes .
but at the summit , the issue was once again used as a means to boost their political images .
the result was nothing more than expressions of good intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen " education should be top priority in germany , " they concluded .
yes , but was n't it top priority before ?
in dresden , state and federal delegations agreed to halve the number of high school and college dropouts .
that 's been called for many times , but changes have yet to be seen .
the state and federal governments have also said they want to increase the education budget by 10 percent by the year 2015 .
that sounds good - but no one has said how they plan to reach this goal .
money for banks , not for education it 's amazing that it is possible to decide on a billion-euro rescue package for the troubled finance industry in just a few days , but that it is apparently unfeasible to agree on financing germany 's most important resource - education .
what was announced on wednesday was merely symbolic : " look , we 've made it top priority ; we 'll take care of it . "
that sounds good , especially ahead of an election year in the federal parliament as well as several state governments .
after all , a committee was established to figure out how the ambitious goals can be financed .
but there wo n't be any results until after the 2009 bundestag election .
delay instead of action , that 's the motto .
' education for all ' still just a dream once again , the main problems with the german education system were n't addressed .
it 's a disaster that , in a wealthy country like germany , parents ' bank accounts still determine their children 's education options .
former chancellor willy brandt 's appeal in the 1970s for " education for all " has never been fulfilled .
the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school and the working class child goes to the third-tier tech school - that 's still often the case .
children with so-called non-academic backgrounds or from immigrant families are n't challenged enough and their potential goes unrecognized .
germany 's education budget is well below the average of many other industrial countries .
particularly in the elementary schools , much less is invested per child than elsewhere .

" it provides information about the fate of jews in national-socialist germany , their place of birth , their place of residence and about whether and when they left germany or when they were murdered , " franka kuehn , spokeswoman for the german foundation for remembrance , responsibility and future , which initiated the research project , told deutsche welle .
on thursday , oct .
23 , german culture minister bernd neumann and martin salm , the head of the foundation , officially lodged the list at yad vashem .
though the israeli memorial site has a huge database of its own , the german contribution is a valuable addition because it is based on over 1,000 sources - more than ever used at one time .
long-drawn out process kuehn said that several terminology issues had to be sorted out during the research process , as it was n't always clear who was a jew and who was n't .
the nazis ' own records of jews contained people who may have only sympathized with the jews and were therefore also persecuted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many holocaust victims were transported to death camps by train " the term jew had a racist connotation during the time of national socialism , " said kuehn .
one might ask whether golo mann -lrb- son of german writer thomas mann -rrb- would have wanted to see his name on a list of german jews , but it 's not our job as a foundation to answer these kinds of questions . "
the study follows a 1986 compilation , revised in 2005 , of the names of the 150,000 german jews killed in the holocaust .
a greater number of german jews managed to flee .
the nazis killed an estimated 6 million jews in europe .
the german foundation for remembrance , responsibility and future was founded in 2002 to organize compensation payments to forced laborers under the nazi regime .
by the end of 2007 , the foundation had disbursed 4.37 billion euros from german industries and the state to more than 1.5 million people in 98 countries . dw staff -lrb- hg / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.10.2008 two jailed in ivory coast in dutch toxic dumping scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ivorian man in an oxygen mask in abijhan where toxic waste was dumped a court in ivory coast jailed two people over a deadly 2006 dumping of toxic waste which killed at least 17 people and poisoned thousands after a dutch firm paid an african company to dispose 500 tons of toxic liquid . it 's a case of catching the little fish while watching the big fish wriggle away .
at least for now .
the little fish , also known as salomon ugborugo , was the head of the ivory coast company , which in 2006 agreed to dispose of 500 tons of liquid waste for the big fish - - otherwise known as dutch multinational firm trafigura . ugborugo 's company did get rid of the waste .
the problem was , they did so without treating it , and the resulting fumes killed an estimated 17 people and have made an estimated 100,000 people in abidjan ill . now , for his role ugborugo is looking at 20 years behind bars .
his partner at the city ’ s port will get 5 years .
ugborugo 's lawyer says he 's appalled by the verdict . " the element of intention was clearly missing .
i would have understood if he was only condemned of involuntary homicide . "
the lawyer insists that his client hadn ’ t been aware that the waste was so dangerous . who is to blame ?
the trail leads to the netherlands it ’ s hard to say how much ugborugo actually knew about the dangerous load his company was dumping . but either way , if you follow the story back up the food chain , it doesn ’ t take long to get back to the netherlands-based trafigura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the clearing efforts , much of the toxic waste is still polluting the area marietta harjono from green peace international , says she hopes the buck doesn ’ t just stop with ugborugo .
" trafigura is a big , multi-billion dollar oil company , " she says .
" the only goal is to make as much money as possible . " trafigura had tried to dispose of the waste in amsterdam , hiding the fact that it was toxic .
but once the truth came out , the tanker full of toxic liquid shipped off to africa , hoping to bypass the hundreds of thousands euros it would have cost to safely treat the material . and that ’ s when the trafigura story merged with ugborugo ’ s . 200 million to avoid a lawsuit when it became clear what had made people sick in abidjan , trafigura paid ivory coast more than $ 200 million to avoid a lawsuit in the west african country .
it seems like a lot , but that amount could be peanuts compared to what the disaster has actually cost ivory coast in terms of health care and environmental clean up costs . with that in mind the netherlands has announced it ’ s suing trafigura for illegal dumping practices and a law firm in england has agreed to bring a suit against the company on behalf of 30,000 plaintiffs affected by the waste in abidjan .
unfortunately for the residents of abidjan , regardless of the outcomes in the courts , the nightmare continues , with much of the toxic waste still polluting the air . eric heath -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de a dutch oil trading company agrees to pay 152 million euros to ivory coast to settle a dispute over toxic waste that killed 10 people but the oil trading group trafigura has stressed that the money is not to be seen as damages , nor , it says , was the company responsible for the environmental disaster -lrb- 14.02.2007 -rrb- africa 's environment - a lost paradise under threat africa contributes the least to global greenhouse emissions , but it ’ s hardest hit by climate change .

" we need a coordinated global response to reform the global financial system .
we are living in unprecedented times , and we need unprecedented levels of global coordination , " barroso told reporters in beijing .
" i very much hope that china gives an important contribution to the solution of this financial crisis . it 's a great opportunity for china to show a sense of responsibility , " he said . " it 's very simple : we sink together or we swim together . "

" the present gathering could not be more timely .

23 , said china should have more say in international financial institutions , but also urged beijing to play its part in helping to resolve the global financial crisis .
" we need a coordinated global response to reform the global financial system .
we are living in unprecedented times , and we need unprecedented levels of global coordination , " barroso told reporters in beijing .
" i very much hope that china gives an important contribution to the solution of this financial crisis . it 's a great opportunity for china to show a sense of responsibility , " he said . " it 's very simple : we sink together or we swim together . "

" french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the european union , has already said he would use the asem summit to seek asian backing for his bid to rebuild the world 's financial system . european governments have already committed more than two trillion dollars to help bail out struggling banks and shore up plummeting stock markets in largely coordinated actions . unlike in europe , asian banks have not responded to the crisis with coordinated action , but rather have focused on cutting interest rates , guaranteeing bank deposits and injecting money into credit markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 23.10.2008 report : sarkozy wants to lead euro zone until 2010 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the midst of the finance crisis , the euro zone needs a strong leader , says sarkozy french president nicolas sarkozy reportedly said he wants to become president of the euro zone countries once his term as eu heads expires at the end of the year . according to the french daily le monde on wednesday , oct .
22 , several advisors to the french president have confirmed this strategy .
sarkozy 's ambition is based on his firm conviction that the crisis in georgia and the financial crisis both demonstrated that europe was in need of a strong leader .
according to le monde , sarkozy believes that without such an individual at the helm , the eu would never have been able to negotiate with moscow or decide on an effective plan to rescue european banks .
in addition , with ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty , there will be no stable presidency of the eu , elected for a period of 30 months , as the treaty had foreseen .
next eu presidencies not in euro zone as a result , the eu will be led by the euro-skeptic czech president vaclav klaus and his prime minister , mirek topolanek , beginning on jan .
1 , 2009 , with the prague government fighting for survival after a landslide defeat in recent regional elections .
in july 2009 , the eu will be headed by sweden , which - like the czechs - does not use the single currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next two eu presidency holders are outside the euro zone to avoid what he foresees as a paralysis in the eu , sarkozy sees the soon-to-be 16-member euro zone as an effective alternative , as it was on oct .
12 , when euro zone leaders formulated the european bank rescue plan at a summit in paris convened by the french president .
in a speech before eu parliamentarians in strasbourg on tuesday , sarkozy said that " a meeting of -lrb- eu -rrb- finance ministers is not up to dealing with the crisis . "
german minister rejects joint economic governance only heads of state and government " have the democratic legitimacy " to decide such wide-ranging measures as the bank rescue plan , he said in strasbourg .
since the eurogroup has no legal existence , a euro zone president could be elected without resorting to a constitution .
or a decision could be taken to allow france - that is , sarkozy - to continue in a leadership position until the eu presidency reverts to a country that uses the euro , which would be spain in january 2010 .
however , it seems unlikely that other eu countries will go along with the idea .
in an interview published wednesday in the french business daily la tribune , german economics minister michael glos said the proposal of a single economic governance of euro zone countries was " not suitable for resolving the current problems . "
the problems of individual eu member nations were diverse , he said , and the majority of economic policies should remain national decisions . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , several advisors to the french president have confirmed this strategy .
sarkozy 's ambition is based on his firm conviction that the crisis in georgia and the financial crisis both demonstrated that europe was in need of a strong leader .
according to le monde , sarkozy believes that without such an individual at the helm , the eu would never have been able to negotiate with moscow or decide on an effective plan to rescue european banks .
in addition , with ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty , there will be no stable presidency of the eu , elected for a period of 30 months , as the treaty had foreseen .
next eu presidencies not in euro zone as a result , the eu will be led by the euro-skeptic czech president vaclav klaus and his prime minister , mirek topolanek , beginning on jan .

12 , when euro zone leaders formulated the european bank rescue plan at a summit in paris convened by the french president .
in a speech before eu parliamentarians in strasbourg on tuesday , sarkozy said that " a meeting of -lrb- eu -rrb- finance ministers is not up to dealing with the crisis . "
german minister rejects joint economic governance only heads of state and government " have the democratic legitimacy " to decide such wide-ranging measures as the bank rescue plan , he said in strasbourg .
since the eurogroup has no legal existence , a euro zone president could be elected without resorting to a constitution .
or a decision could be taken to allow france - that is , sarkozy - to continue in a leadership position until the eu presidency reverts to a country that uses the euro , which would be spain in january 2010 .
however , it seems unlikely that other eu countries will go along with the idea .
in an interview published wednesday in the french business daily la tribune , german economics minister michael glos said the proposal of a single economic governance of euro zone countries was " not suitable for resolving the current problems . "

23 , said china should have more say in international financial institutions , but also urged beijing to play its part in helping to resolve the global financial crisis .
" we need a coordinated global response to reform the global financial system .
we are living in unprecedented times , and we need unprecedented levels of global coordination , " barroso told reporters in beijing .
" i very much hope that china gives an important contribution to the solution of this financial crisis . it 's a great opportunity for china to show a sense of responsibility , " he said . " it 's very simple : we sink together or we swim together . "
" we need asia on board " barroso 's comments came ahead of a two-day summit in beijing of the 27 eu member states and 16 asian countries covering the global downturn , climate change and international security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese investors too are an anxious lot nowadays outlining the " unprecedented " challenges facing the global economy , under threat of a looming worldwide recession , barroso said : " we need asia to be on board , and more particularly countries like china , india -lrb- and -rrb- japan . " french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the european union , has already said he would use the asem summit to seek asian backing for his bid to rebuild the world 's financial system . european governments have already committed more than two trillion dollars to help bail out struggling banks and shore up plummeting stock markets in largely coordinated actions . unlike in europe , asian banks have not responded to the crisis with coordinated action , but rather have focused on cutting interest rates , guaranteeing bank deposits and injecting money into credit markets . " the present gathering could not be more timely .
we face challenges which do n't respect any borders , " barroso said . " no one in europe or asia can seriously pretend to be immune .
we are living in unprecedented times , and we need unprecedented levels of global coordination . " barroso says china could enjoy greater influence barroso also hinted that in return beijing could be given greater clout on the world financial stage . china this year won a modest increase in its voting power at the international monetary fund but argues that it is still not being given adequate leverage as the world 's fourth-largest economy and the one that is growing fastest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , right , and barroso want china to step up to the plate on financial reforms " we think china could and should have a greater voice in international financial institutions , " barroso said in a speech at a school for civil servants .
china is among the group of 20 industrial and emerging nations that us president george w. bush invited to a finance summit in washington on nov .
15 .
more concrete internationally coordinated action is expected to come out of the washington conference that friday and saturday 's asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- in beijing .
merkel affirms economic ties to china speaking to reporters in beijing after meeting chinese premier wen jiabao , german chancellor angela merkel said on thursday that " cooperation with china is of utmost importance " for germany .
" it is important to bring china into a new financial system , " she said , adding that china was already making efforts .
" with china 's strong economic growth , china by itself is already making a contribution , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic issues dominate merkel 's visit to china in a speech ahead of his talks with merkel , wen said cooperation with germany was " extremely important " and that china " counts on investment from germany . "
german officials said the fact that merkel was one of the few foreign leaders making a formal state visit to china for the asem summit showed the importance of ties between the two nations .
chancellor defends jailed chinese activist merkel , who was scheduled to meet president hu jintao friday , said she raised human rights issues , including the situation of china 's tibetan and uighur minorities , during her talks , adding that germany wanted to continue dialogue with china on human rights .
she welcomed thursday 's award of the eu 's sakharov prize for human rights to recently jailed chinese dissident hu jia .
" the german government has always called for the release of hu jia and will continue to do so , " she said , adding that she did n't expect the issue to cast a cloud over the asem summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's human rights award for hu jia has irked the chinese government china expressed anger at the decision to award the prize to hu , 35 , who was imprisoned for three-and-a-half years in april on subversion charges . " this is gross interference in china 's domestic affairs , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . but experts say the incident is unlikely to seriously mar the summit or strain ties between china and the eu .
" the fact is , in spite of all the political irritation and debates in the last few months about the dalai lama and the olympics , the significance of bilateral economic relations between germany and china or europe and china was never denied by anyone , " eberhard sandschneider , research director at the german council on foreign relations told deutsche welle . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at least for now .
the little fish , also known as salomon ugborugo , was the head of the ivory coast company , which in 2006 agreed to dispose of 500 tons of liquid waste for the big fish - - otherwise known as dutch multinational firm trafigura . ugborugo 's company did get rid of the waste .
the problem was , they did so without treating it , and the resulting fumes killed an estimated 17 people and have made an estimated 100,000 people in abidjan ill . now , for his role ugborugo is looking at 20 years behind bars .
his partner at the city ’ s port will get 5 years .
ugborugo 's lawyer says he 's appalled by the verdict . " the element of intention was clearly missing .
i would have understood if he was only condemned of involuntary homicide . "
the lawyer insists that his client hadn ’ t been aware that the waste was so dangerous . who is to blame ?
the trail leads to the netherlands it ’ s hard to say how much ugborugo actually knew about the dangerous load his company was dumping . but either way , if you follow the story back up the food chain , it doesn ’ t take long to get back to the netherlands-based trafigura . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the clearing efforts , much of the toxic waste is still polluting the area marietta harjono from green peace international , says she hopes the buck doesn ’ t just stop with ugborugo .
" trafigura is a big , multi-billion dollar oil company , " she says .
" the only goal is to make as much money as possible . " trafigura had tried to dispose of the waste in amsterdam , hiding the fact that it was toxic .
but once the truth came out , the tanker full of toxic liquid shipped off to africa , hoping to bypass the hundreds of thousands euros it would have cost to safely treat the material . and that ’ s when the trafigura story merged with ugborugo ’ s . 200 million to avoid a lawsuit when it became clear what had made people sick in abidjan , trafigura paid ivory coast more than $ 200 million to avoid a lawsuit in the west african country .
it seems like a lot , but that amount could be peanuts compared to what the disaster has actually cost ivory coast in terms of health care and environmental clean up costs . with that in mind the netherlands has announced it ’ s suing trafigura for illegal dumping practices and a law firm in england has agreed to bring a suit against the company on behalf of 30,000 plaintiffs affected by the waste in abidjan .
unfortunately for the residents of abidjan , regardless of the outcomes in the courts , the nightmare continues , with much of the toxic waste still polluting the air . eric heath -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

coinciding with the release , a german university is investigating the trauma of the victims . the movie picks up a story long neglected in german post-war history : the plight of rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii .
" a woman in berlin " premiered at septembers ' film festival in toronto and is being released in theaters across germany on thursday , oct .
23 .
the movie is based on the autobiographical account of marta hiller , a young woman in berlin between the months of april and june in 1945 .
when the book was published anonymously in the 1950s , reactions were overwhelmingly negative .
from flop to bestseller a republished edition hit the shelves only as late as 2003 - - two years after hiller 's death - - and proved to be a bestseller .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their men gone , women were left to pick up the pieces the lead role is portrayed by german actress nina hoss , playing the young woman as soviet soldiers entered berlin in may 1945 .
she 's raped several times by red army soldiers until she eventually enters into a relationship with a russian officer to shield herself from further attacks .
rape victims in the aftermath of world war ii have long been a difficult chapter in german history , especially in communist east germany , where any criticism of the russian army was impossible .
" for the first time the phenomenon of mass rapes at the end of the war is the subject of a german movie , " said jochen-konrad fromme , a german parliamentarian and a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
" that means that 63 years after the end of the war , the fate and suffering of hundreds of thousands of german women is being acknowledged for the first time , " he added .
millions of victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress nina hoss says her character ' went through hell ' fromme added that historians estimate around 2 million women became victims of rape after the war .
cases of sexual violence also occurred in the western part of germany under the allied forces , yet historians agree that the problem was particularly acute under the soviet army .
coinciding with the release of the movie , the university of greifswald in northeastern germany has launched a research project to study the trauma of women raped during that period .
phillip kuwert , who is heading the project , said that it will help to analyze the long-term psychological effects .
better methods of treatment could then be developed for other conflict or war zones .
german newspapers have reacted with mixed reviews to " a woman in berlin . "
some critics are bashing the filmmakers for treating the serious subject on a level way too trivial and sentimental .
others praise the movie for bringing a chapter of german history to a wider audience which so far many people have been ill-informed about . dw staff -lrb- ai -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seven others were acquitted .
the dutch company that shipped the waste paid a $ 200m -lrb- £ 108m -rrb- out-of-court settlement relating to civil claims in 2007 .
the company , trafigura , never admitted liability , saying the payment was made out of sympathy for the ivorian people .
seventeen people died and thousands suffered breathing problems and nausea .
the dutch multi-national firm chartered the ship carrying the waste , which was unloaded in ivory coast , after a failure to agree deals to get it treated in the netherlands .
it said it had contracted a local firm , tommy , to handle the waste in good faith .

the ivory coast attorney general , damou kouyate , said " a wild quest for money " had led those involved to set up the " fatal deal " .
in march 2008 , the ivorian court of appeal ruled that there was insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges against trafigura .

and while the probo koala 's slops were offloaded in abidjan when the ship docked there , the company said independent experts had found the slops could not have caused the widespread alleged illnesses .

by professor ngaire woods presenter , analysis , bbc radio 4 we are living in economic chaos .
banks , homes , jobs , and businesses are at risk .
yet curiously , the one thing that seems stable is the dollar .
it is a symbol - and a lever - of american power and leadership , itis the standard unit of account for much of the world 's economic activity .
and in times of crisis , it has often seemed a safe haven .
but in the longer term , some experts believe this crisis could mark a turning point in the dollar 's fortunes , hastening a fall from power which has seen its value decline over several years before its recent rally .
" i think today 's financial crisis is going to hasten the end of the dollar as the world 's reserve currency " , says avinash persaud , chairman of intelligence capital limited .
" for the first time ever we 're now seeing that in the financial markets it costs money to guarantee you against a us government default . "
' exorbitant privilege ' " for the american government there is simply no such thing as living beyond its means .
with the rest of the world demanding dollars , all the us has to do is to keep printing them " prof ngaire woods dollars and dominance listen to the programme he wonders whether the combined cost of foreign wars and domestic bail-outs is being seen as " a burden too far " for the us .
but for the dollar to lose reserve currency status would end what has been in many ways a huge bonus for the us .
it is sometimes described as the ability to write cheques that no-one ever cashes .
so for the american government there is simply no such thing as living beyond its means .
with the rest of the world demanding dollars , all the us has to do is to keep printing them .
this makes possible things that no other government could imagine - a power that america 's rivals have historically denounced as an " exorbitant privilege " .
in the early 1970s , us treasury secretary john connally even told the outside world , brutally , that the dollar was " our currency , but your problem " .
euro reluctance since then , europe has developed its own currency , the euro , which has taken on a global role .
as it grew in strength against the dollar it challenged some of the dollar 's glamorous reputation .
supermodels in new york started asking for contracts in euros rather than dollars .
but european leaders are far from keen on seeing their currency become the world 's reserve money .
" europe has got a much less vast set of ambitions than america has ever had " , says david marsh , a banker who is just finishing a book charting the birth of the euro .
adopting the currency , he adds , was a " flight into a lack of ambition " .
potential to undermine so might a rising economic power like china supply the dollar 's eventual global successor ?

by professor ngaire woods presenter , analysis , bbc radio 4 the dollar is becoming more of a problem for the us , prof woods argues .
we are living in economic chaos .
banks , homes , jobs , and businesses are at risk .
yet curiously , the one thing that seems stable is the dollar .
it is a symbol - and a lever - of american power and leadership , itis the standard unit of account for much of the world 's economic activity .
and in times of crisis , it has often seemed a safe haven .
but in the longer term , some experts believe this crisis could mark a turning point in the dollar 's fortunes , hastening a fall from power which has seen its value decline over several years before its recent rally .
" i think today 's financial crisis is going to hasten the end of the dollar as the world 's reserve currency " , says avinash persaud , chairman of intelligence capital limited .
" for the first time ever we 're now seeing that in the financial markets it costs money to guarantee you against a us government default . "
' exorbitant privilege ' for the american government there is simply no such thing as living beyond its means .
with the rest of the world demanding dollars , all the us has to do is to keep printing them prof ngaire woods dollars and dominance listen to the programme he wonders whether the combined cost of foreign wars and domestic bail-outs is being seen as " a burden too far " for the us .
but for the dollar to lose reserve currency status would end what has been in many ways a huge bonus for the us .
it is sometimes described as the ability to write cheques that no-one ever cashes .
so for the american government there is simply no such thing as living beyond its means .
with the rest of the world demanding dollars , all the us has to do is to keep printing them .
this makes possible things that no other government could imagine - a power that america 's rivals have historically denounced as an " exorbitant privilege " .
in the early 1970s , us treasury secretary john connally even told the outside world , brutally , that the dollar was " our currency , but your problem " .
euro reluctance since then , europe has developed its own currency , the euro , which has taken on a global role .
as it grew in strength against the dollar it challenged some of the dollar 's glamorous reputation .
supermodels in new york started asking for contracts in euros rather than dollars .
but european leaders are far from keen on seeing their currency become the world 's reserve money .
chinese exports have helped it build up huge dollar reserves " europe has got a much less vast set of ambitions than america has ever had " , says david marsh , a banker who is just finishing a book charting the birth of the euro .
adopting the currency , he adds , was a " flight into a lack of ambition " .
potential to undermine so might a rising economic power like china supply the dollar 's eventual global successor ?
at present , china lacks the open markets or institutions to support that role .
but avinash persaud points out that similarly dismissive things were said about the us a century ago .
we are emerging into is this very hazy and slightly worrying state of affairs where there is n't going to be any single country leading the world in the way the us has done and with it no single currency either jim o 'neill goldman sachs the us did not have a central bank until 1913 , yet within a few decades the dollar was challenging sterling for world domination .

advertisement zoe walters is fighting for the future of the royal glamorgan hospital 's neonatal unit zoe walters is looking forward to celebrating her son 's first birthday - and campaigning to ensure the future of the hospital unit that saved his life .
her son louis was born after just 24 weeks of her pregnancy at the royal glamorgan hospital in llantrisant , weighing in at only 1lb 13ozs -lrb- 0.8kg -rrb- .
but the hospital is currently closed to new admissions needing intensive neonatal care , due to staffing issues .
that has prompted louis ' mother to help organise a campaign to save the unit .
" babies born at my son 's age -lsb- 24 weeks gestation -rsb- are having to be transferred all over the uk , " explained ms walters .
" if a parent lives in cardiff and has to travel to bristol to see their child it 's awful . "
she said she knew of one mother who had been transferred to a specialist baby unit in glasgow .
baby louis was born at the royal glamorgan hospital weighing 1lb 13ozs " the staff at the unit are so devoted .
it 's not just a job to them , they become like a family , " she added .
the staffing problems at the royal glamorgan mean that in practice , babies born before a 30-week gestation period must be admitted elsewhere .
cwm taf nhs trust said this was a temporary measure to ensure patient safety because of a national problem in recruiting middle grade medical staff .
the trust said decisions on additional funding were being made shortly which should enable the neonatal service to return to normal .
" the trust has been in close contact with health commission wales who are responsible for commissioning neonatal services and it is expected that decisions on additional funding and clarity upon future service provision will be made within the next week , " the trust said in a statement .
" this should ease recruitment difficulties and enable the trust to return to level three service provision -lsb- the highest level of care -rsb- . "
campaign young louis walters is now 11-months-old and weighs 23lb -lrb- 10.4kg -rrb- , and ms walters is determined to fight for the neonatal unit 's survivals .
she has helped organise a protest which will be held in pontypridd on saturday .
more than 3,000 people have also signed up to a group ms walters set up on social networking site facebook .
however , a spokesperson for the welsh assembly government said care for sick babies would continue at the royal glamorgan hospital and the unit would not close .
" plans to enhance care for the most sick babies in wales were endorsed by clinicians following a review of neonatal services , " said the spokesperson .
" this recommended the development of four neonatal intensive care units in wales .
" these units would be at the university hospital of wales -lsb- in cardiff -rsb- , singleton hospital , swansea , royal gwent hospital , newport and ysbyty glan clwyd , bodelwyddan .
" the current maternity units , including the royal glamorgan , llantrisant will continue to provide intensive care for short periods , but with improved care at the four neonatal intensive care units , capacity to care for the most sick children will be increased , which will lead to a better outcome for the babies .

how many projects have been given approval for the new round of regional funding from the european union ?
to date , 42 projects have been approved .
but there are many more projects in the pipeline - with 393 applications registered with the wales european funding office -lrb- wefo -rrb- , of which 241 are being formally assessed , with 75 of these at the final stages of detailed assessment .
those 75 projects at the final stages of the process are close to a decision - although since this is a competitive process , some of these projects may be rejected and will never materialise .
how much money is available ?
the total amount of eu funding that will be available between 2007-13 in west wales , the valleys and east wales is £ 1,762m , with a total match funding worth £ 1,834m .
based on an exchange rate of £ 1/1.26 euros , this gives a grand total of £ 3,596m .
this is £ 240m more than was anticipated in august 2007 , because of currency fluctuations .
how many projects will get european cash ?
the early estimates are that about 500 projects will receive funding between 2007 and 2013 - which is significantly lower than the total number of around 3000 projects that were approved in the previous round of funding , between 2000 and 2006 .
the official explanation for this reduction is that the welsh assembly government now favours a more strategic approach , with less duplication , and a significant reduction in management overheads - all of which will get more money away from administration costs , and towards front line projects .
how much of the money has been spent so far ?
because of the way that european funding works , the figures for actual money spent wo n't be known for some time .
however , we do know how much money has been allocated to approved projects .
the 42 approved projects have been allocated £ 380m in eu funding - worth 22 % of the total available amount .
officials note that this compares favourably with the 14 % level of commitment at the same stage of the previous objective 1 funding cycle .
the total value of these projects , including match funding , is £ 809m .
how confident is the assembly government that it will spend all of the european funding available ?
officials think they 'll manage to spend around 98 % of the total amount of funding from the old objective one schemes , which is about to be wound up at the end of december .
this compares to 86 % of the pre-2000 schemes in wales , and the around 80 % average underspend in european funding projects more generally .
this 98 % rate of spend includes an extra £ 40m that was received because of changes in the exchange rate of sterling / euro .
this was largely spent by extending funding for existing projects .
it 's far too early to put any kind of figures on spending rates for the new 2007-2013 schemes .
is it true that the assembly government is approving more of its own projects than others ?
no .
just under half of the projects approved so far have been sponsored by assembly government departments .
the assembly government thinks this was necessary to get the new programme off the ground , as well as giving it shape and structure .
however , officials say that a large number of non-governmental projects are now in the final stages of approval , and should further reduce the government 's share of projects .
is the private sector being short-changed or cut out of projects by the assembly government ?
yes and no - this largely depends on your perspective .
of the 42 approved projects so far , only two have been sponsored by private sector companies - furnace farm ltd -lrb- centre of excellence for welsh food in the conwy valley -rrb- , and uk steel enterprise -lrb- ebbw vale innovation centre -rrb- .
but on the other hand , 46 % of approved funding has gone to support for business , with £ 196m for business finance , £ 84m for research & development and innovation , £ 10m for ict and another £ 80m for other enterprise support including business start-ups .
this means that rather than having many small organisations applying directly for eu funding , smaller organisations would be able to submit tenders to larger eu funded projects for specific work - effectively sub-contracting work at arms length from the complex application process for eu funds .
44 % of approved funding has been allocated to support individuals - with £ 213m to help people into work , £ 134m to improve skills , and £ 12m to promote equal opportunities .
another 7 % -lrb- £ 62m -rrb- has so far been allocated to support communities , environment and transport .

in the us , detroit 's big three - general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- , ford and chrysler - recently secured a $ 25bn government cash injection into the industry and may soon return for more .
european policy makers are considering similar action to help an industry in crisis .
prepared for a slump but when in a more contemplative mood , many of the industry 's top executives are looking beyond the recession , and there they see gold .
the us is a much more immediately responsive market tom purves , chief executive , rolls-royce motor cars rolls-royce and rivals face challenging times audio reports on trouble in the car industry leaning confidently back in his chair , bentley motors chief franz-josef paefgen says he is " very optimistic " , even though the crewe-based luxury car maker has seen sales drop by about a third since spring .
" although we are having difficult times and the market is in a terrible condition , we are prepared for it , " he says , pointing out that , even following the sales slump , bentley is producing many more cars than it did five years ago .
bentley sales rose from about 1,000 cars a year to about 10,000 cars between 2003 and last year , and there is no telling when demand will be revived , mr paefgen points out .
" it will come back one way or another , " he declares .
" we continue to invest in new product .
we are investing at the highest level since volkswagen bought bentley a decade ago . "
jim wright , vice president of nissan 's luxury-subsidiary infiniti , which has just entered europe , is also eagerly looking beyond the recession .
brand-building during a downturn should lead to strong sales growth once the economy recovers , he believes .
american bounce ?
weaker oil prices should help , according to both economists and industry officials .
cars are indispensible anywhere in the world for people to move , and the current financial situation does not change that mitsuo kinoshita , executive vice-president of toyota motor corporation toyota eyes european growth oil prices should average $ 60 a barrel in 2009 and slip towards $ 50 by the end of the year , deutsche bank 's energy analysts predict .
this could provide some short-term relief for us automotive firms as lower prices at the pump might slow down the shift towards smaller , more fuel-efficient cars .
in the short-run , this might make it easier for companies such as gm , chrysler and ford to get rid of their backlog of gas-guzzling models , and thus give them more time to change both the way they make cars and the way they are structured .
rolls-royce motor cars ' new chief executive tom purves , who headed up bmw 's north america division for almost a decade , predicts that the world 's largest car market could bounce back quickly .
" the us is a much more immediately responsive market , " he says .
" it goes down and up simply faster and people react more instantaneously .
the systems and structures are more organised . "
fast-growing demand mitsuo kinoshita , executive vice-president of toyota motor corporation , is also confident that demand will pick up in the medium- to long-term .
the best is still ahead of us daimler chief dieter zetsche car industry squares up to economic storm " cars are indispensible anywhere in the world for people to move , and the current financial situation does not change that , " he grins .
dieter zetsche , chairman of the management board at daimler and head of mercedes cars , agrees .
" there are many studies that say it took 120 years to get to 800 million cars around the globe , and that it will take only another 30 years to double that volume , " he says .
" if that is true , the best is still ahead of us . "
even fritz henderson , chief operating officer of loss-making gm , is optimistic .
" we certainly still think the long-term prospects are very attractive , " he says .
adds bmw 's mr robertson : " this industry is very resilient .
this industry has seen difficult times before .
" the change has occurred unbelievably quickly .
what was seen as a one way track - ' you 'd better get in quick ' - has gone down , " he observes .
" but we need to keep reminding ourselves that things can turn quickly once again . "
new markets hence , rather than shrink , the global car industry is still expected to grow dramatically in the long-run - though this is unlikely to happen in an orderly fashion .
we certainly still think the long-term prospects are very attractive fritz henderson , chief operating officer , general motors prosperity driven from detroit in the future , the strongest sales growth is unlikely to come in the us and europe , where manufacturing is currently strong .
instead sales growth will come from the middle east , russia , china and india .
" our basic philosophy is to manufacture where demand is and the major demand now is in emerging markets , " says toyota 's mr kinoshita .
hence , although the future may be bright for the car industry at large , it looks gloomier for those working in factories , for suppliers or in dealerships in the us and western europe .
here , job cuts may well pick up pace and temporary closures of factories may become permanent .
in turn , some companies - and certainly some brands owned by large automotive groups - may fail and disappear during the downturn , with others being acquired by rivals .
but this , says mr zetsche , should not boost anyone 's overall market power .
" even though there might be more consolidation , and potentially even the demise of one or two companies of today , those will be replaced by new players from china and india , " he says .
and in a decade or two , he predicts , there will be a " a relatively similar automotive landscape to today 's " .

bentley sales rose from about 1,000 cars a year to about 10,000 cars between 2003 and last year , and there is no telling when demand will be revived , mr paefgen points out .
" it will come back one way or another , " he declares .
" we continue to invest in new product .
we are investing at the highest level since volkswagen bought bentley a decade ago . "
jim wright , vice president of nissan 's luxury-subsidiary infiniti , which has just entered europe , is also eagerly looking beyond the recession .
brand-building during a downturn should lead to strong sales growth once the economy recovers , he believes .
american bounce ?
weaker oil prices should help , according to both economists and industry officials .
cars are indispensible anywhere in the world for people to move , and the current financial situation does not change that mitsuo kinoshita , executive vice-president of toyota motor corporation toyota eyes european growth oil prices should average $ 60 a barrel in 2009 and slip towards $ 50 by the end of the year , deutsche bank 's energy analysts predict .
this could provide some short-term relief for us automotive firms as lower prices at the pump might slow down the shift towards smaller , more fuel-efficient cars .
in the short-run , this might make it easier for companies such as gm , chrysler and ford to get rid of their backlog of gas-guzzling models , and thus give them more time to change both the way they make cars and the way they are structured .
rolls-royce motor cars ' new chief executive tom purves , who headed up bmw 's north america division for almost a decade , predicts that the world 's largest car market could bounce back quickly .
" the us is a much more immediately responsive market , " he says .
" it goes down and up simply faster and people react more instantaneously .
the systems and structures are more organised . "
fast-growing demand mitsuo kinoshita , executive vice-president of toyota motor corporation , is also confident that demand will pick up in the medium- to long-term .
the best is still ahead of us daimler chief dieter zetsche car industry squares up to economic storm " cars are indispensible anywhere in the world for people to move , and the current financial situation does not change that , " he grins .
dieter zetsche , chairman of the management board at daimler and head of mercedes cars , agrees .
" there are many studies that say it took 120 years to get to 800 million cars around the globe , and that it will take only another 30 years to double that volume , " he says .
" if that is true , the best is still ahead of us . "
even fritz henderson , chief operating officer of loss-making gm , is optimistic .
" we certainly still think the long-term prospects are very attractive , " he says .
adds bmw 's mr robertson : " this industry is very resilient .
this industry has seen difficult times before .
" the change has occurred unbelievably quickly .
what was seen as a one way track - ' you 'd better get in quick ' - has gone down , " he observes .
" but we need to keep reminding ourselves that things can turn quickly once again . "
new markets hence , rather than shrink , the global car industry is still expected to grow dramatically in the long-run - though this is unlikely to happen in an orderly fashion .
we certainly still think the long-term prospects are very attractive fritz henderson , chief operating officer , general motors prosperity driven from detroit in the future , the strongest sales growth is unlikely to come in the us and europe , where manufacturing is currently strong .
instead sales growth will come from the middle east , russia , china and india .
" our basic philosophy is to manufacture where demand is and the major demand now is in emerging markets , " says toyota 's mr kinoshita .
hence , although the future may be bright for the car industry at large , it looks gloomier for those working in factories , for suppliers or in dealerships in the us and western europe .
here , job cuts may well pick up pace and temporary closures of factories may become permanent .
in turn , some companies - and certainly some brands owned by large automotive groups - may fail and disappear during the downturn , with others being acquired by rivals .
but this , says mr zetsche , should not boost anyone 's overall market power .
" even though there might be more consolidation , and potentially even the demise of one or two companies of today , those will be replaced by new players from china and india , " he says .
and in a decade or two , he predicts , there will be a " a relatively similar automotive landscape to today 's " .

manufacturing plants are closing , production is being cut back , jobs are being axed and car company share prices are tumbling as a consequence .
" we did n't really expect the market to go down so quickly , " says toyota motor europe 's head of sales and marketing , thierry dombreval .
" the market has become increasingly competitive . "
nevertheless , while top executives at the top carmakers admit times are tough , they have told the bbc that they expect to emerge from the recession stronger than ever .
" to use motorcycling terminology , when you enter a corner you do n't look into the corner , you look at where you want to be when you get out of that corner , " says bmw 's board member in charge of sales and marketing , ian robertson .
immediate pain but first , the automotive sector must prepare for 2009 , which is expected to be even tougher than this year .
" customers are relying on financing , so the credit squeeze is affecting all markets , " adds john fleming , president and chief executive of ford europe .
" sales are going down and markets are softening . "
in the us , detroit 's big three - general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- , ford and chrysler - recently secured a $ 25bn government cash injection into the industry and may soon return for more .
european policy makers are considering similar action to help an industry in crisis .
prepared for a slump but when in a more contemplative mood , many of the industry 's top executives are looking beyond the recession , and there they see gold . "

drax group , which runs the drax power station near selby , aims to run three so-called green power plants at hull , immingham and one other site .
the third site could be close to the existing drax plant .
the firm said the three plants would generate 900 megawatts of power for the national grid .
bio-mass power plants generate electricity by burning a range of fuels including energy crops , wood chips and other material from renewable sources , the company said .
carbon footprint and the firm said planning applications for the plants at hull and immingham have already begun .
company officials said construction of the first of the three plants is expected for late 2010 with power flowing from the unspecified site by 2014 .
drax chief executive dorothy thompson said : " we believe our venture into dedicated bio-mass-fired generation underpins our commitment to reducing the carbon footprint of electricity generation from the continued , but necessary , reliance on fossil fuels , whilst delivering secure and reliable supplies of electricity . "
ms thompson said that based on current estimates , once all three plants were operational , drax would be responsible for supplying at least 15 % of the uk 's renewable power and up to 10 % of total uk electricity .
greenpeace chief scientist dr doug parr said : " biomass plants can help us in the fight against climate change , but only if they make the most of the waste heat they produce and use fuel from carefully chosen sources .
" otherwise they 're cutting down trees , shipping them across the world and then throwing away the energy they get from them .
" drax already owns the single most polluting power station in the uk , and if they fail to get the technology right on these power plants they could be making their carbon footprint bigger , not smaller . "

drax group , which runs the drax power station near selby , aims to run three so-called green power plants at hull , immingham and one other site .
the third site could be close to the existing drax plant .
the firm said the three plants would generate 900 megawatts of power for the national grid .
bio-mass power plants generate electricity by burning a range of fuels including energy crops , wood chips and other material from renewable sources , the company said .
carbon footprint and the firm said planning applications for the plants at hull and immingham have already begun .
company officials said construction of the first of the three plants is expected for late 2010 with power flowing from the unspecified site by 2014 .
drax chief executive dorothy thompson said : " we believe our venture into dedicated bio-mass-fired generation underpins our commitment to reducing the carbon footprint of electricity generation from the continued , but necessary , reliance on fossil fuels , whilst delivering secure and reliable supplies of electricity . "
ms thompson said that based on current estimates , once all three plants were operational , drax would be responsible for supplying at least 15 % of the uk 's renewable power and up to 10 % of total uk electricity .
greenpeace chief scientist dr doug parr said : " biomass plants can help us in the fight against climate change , but only if they make the most of the waste heat they produce and use fuel from carefully chosen sources .
" otherwise they 're cutting down trees , shipping them across the world and then throwing away the energy they get from them .
" drax already owns the single most polluting power station in the uk , and if they fail to get the technology right on these power plants they could be making their carbon footprint bigger , not smaller . "
