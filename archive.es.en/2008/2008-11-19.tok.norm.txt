program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.11.2008 german minister : eu plans massive economic aid package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the package might be too small the european union is planning to unveil an economic stimulus package worth 130 billion euros , german economics minister michael glos said wednesday .
all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .
solarworld bids for opel factories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as opel awaits its fate , solar world make an audacious bid verheugen 's comments came as german solar energy company solarworld announced it had prepared an offer for the four german auto factories owned by opel , worth one billion euros , to create the " first green european car company . "
whatever measures are decided on , rescue action for the auto industry in europe can not come fast enough .
car sales across europe were down 14.5 per cent in october on the same month in 2007 .
the social and financial cost of a bankrupt car industry would be dramatic .
the european car industry provides income for some 12 million families and last year generated a combined turnover of 551 billion euros -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- , or about 5 percent of the continent 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a david-and-goliath takeover offer for the german factories of general motors sent the share price of the bidding company , solarworld , crashing 16 per cent lower wednesday , nov 19 as gm rejected the one-billion euro bid . solarworld , which assembles and installs smaller electricity generating systems that rely on wind or the sun , asked gm to give it four factories , a german research centre , the opel brand and 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- . the bonn-based company said it would inject an additional 1 billion euros of its own cash and loans to convert opel into " europe 's first green automobile maker , " designing cars with low- emission engines . gm dismisses bid , says opel is not for sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's parent company has no intention of selling us-based general motors promptly rejected the bid .
in detroit , a gm spokesman said opel was not for sale and claims otherwise were " pure speculation . " gm , the world 's biggest automobile manufacturer , took over the adam opel company 80 years ago . solarworld ag , based in bonn , germany , demanded a dowry from general motors of 40,000 euros for each opel employee it took over , amounting to " compensation " of one billion euros . solarworld offered to invest 250 million euros cash in the takeover and raise 750 million euros in bank loans , provided the banks were given a federal government guarantee for the sum . as of early afternoon , solarworld stock was trading at 13.66 euros , down 16 per cent from tuesday 's close in frankfurt . a german government spokesman declined substantive comment on the call for guarantees , saying there was nothing to discuss unless the two companies actually opened negotiations . solarworld chief executive frank asbeck said it was a serious offer .
his company had 1 billion euros in reserve , he added . opel fears based on ailing parent company shares bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dark clouds of bankruptcy gather over opel general motors has seen its share price plunge amid bankruptcy fears .
opel has asked for german state aid , but german politicians have been reluctant to help in a way that indirectly benefits the parent . solarworld has a payroll of 2,254 people .
opel , with its main office in a frankfurt suburb , has more than 10 times as many .
opel was not in a position to immediately give a reaction to the solarworld statement , a spokeswoman told reporters .
the german automaker has been hit by slumping sales and financial problems at its parent company , and has asked the german government for loan guarantees in the event it can no longer obtain financing from gm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 19.11.2008 germany criticizes eu changes to maternity leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say the proposals focus on women the eu commission would like to make it easier for new mothers to return to the workplace by providing longer and better paid maternity leave .
but brussels ' plans have met with criticism in germany . the eu commission would like to ensure that women are better able to combine work and family life .
to that end , self-employed women are to receive paid maternity leave for the first time . additionally , the commission 's proposals would increase the minimum period of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and recommend paying women 100 percent of their salary beyond the current minimum of paying at least equivalent to sick pay . women would have more flexibility to decide when to take the non-compulsory portion of their leave , either before or after childbirth , and would no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of leave before childbirth , as is presently the case in many member states . for most eu member countries , the proposals are more or less in keeping with the way governments already manage maternity leave .
but in germany , there was outrage when the commission unveiled its plans in early october . many women in germany do n't want to give up their jobs in order to raise children .

but brussels ' plans have met with criticism in germany . the eu commission would like to ensure that women are better able to combine work and family life .
to that end , self-employed women are to receive paid maternity leave for the first time . additionally , the commission 's proposals would increase the minimum period of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and recommend paying women 100 percent of their salary beyond the current minimum of paying at least equivalent to sick pay . women would have more flexibility to decide when to take the non-compulsory portion of their leave , either before or after childbirth , and would no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of leave before childbirth , as is presently the case in many member states . for most eu member countries , the proposals are more or less in keeping with the way governments already manage maternity leave .
but in germany , there was outrage when the commission unveiled its plans in early october . many women in germany do n't want to give up their jobs in order to raise children .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.11.2008 ailing german car industry faces job cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's car industry has coughed up some serious problems germany 's ailing car industry faces the prospect of slashing jobs as the global slump hits home .
dwindling demand and problems with liquidity have some of the biggest names in the business eyeing a bleak future . there 's a saying in germany that when daimler coughs , the state of baden-wuerttemberg catches pneumonia .
things are not yet quite as bad as that in the home of mercedes-benz , or in germany in general .
but strong medicine is needed to get germany 's ailing car industry back on its feet amid a slump in profits and sales .
the first dose was requested by opel , once the nation 's biggest carmaker , which has been brought to its knees by the massive losses suffered by its us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- .
opel has asked the german government for 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
chancellor angela merkel has promised a decision by the end of december , but insists that any funding would have to stay in germany and not be transferred back to gm .
opel , which employees 27,500 workers at four plants across the country , has already reduced production and sent workers home because not enough people are buying its cars .
similarly , daimler has extended the winter holiday for production staff .
it recently announced that sales in october had slumped 18.1 percent over the year , to 93,900 vehicles .
slump in demand sets off warning alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of new cars are all dressed up with nowhere to go the global financial crisis has badly hit demand for new cars , triggering alarm in germany , where an estimated one in six jobs is related to the sector , either directly or indirectly .
in the stuttgart region of baden-wuerttemberg , where daimler has its headquarters , 300,000 people depend on the car industry for a living .
porsche and auto supplier bosch also have factories there .
some 100,000 jobs in the industry could disappear by the end of 2009 unless concrete action is taken to shore up the sector , says ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a leading automotive expert at the university of duisburg-essen .
willi diez , a professor at geislingen university 's automobile economics department , believes car manufacturers could slash 25,000 jobs by the middle of next year , with the same number disappearing from companies that supply auto parts .
workers at faltering opel have much to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel plant in eisenach is currently on life-support car workers are concerned about their future in the 60,000-population city of ruesselsheim , south-west of frankfurt , where opel is by far the biggest employer .
" it has all happened so quickly .
and if our parent company collapses , then it is all over for us , " said one of the 18,300 workers as he clocked off at the end of shift on monday .
" without opel , we might as well as pack up , " said adnan dayankac , chairman of a local association that includes many foreigners who work for the carmaker .
" the whole city and the surrounding region depend on opel . "
the mood is not much better in the eastern german city of eisenach , where 1,900 workers are employed at a plant that assembles the popular compact model corsa .
production was halted in eisenach for three weeks in october .
many workers are worried that soon there might not be any cars at all coming off the production lines .
" we are afraid general motors will pull us down with it into the abyss , " said harald lieske , who has been with opel since it began production in the east 18 years ago and now heads its workers ' council .
glos optimistic of opel survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those are alarm bells you 're hearing , herr glos german economics minister michael glos said he was optimistic that opel would weather the crisis .
he said opel would have been better off had it remained a german-owned company and not become a subsidiary of gm .
glos singled out the opel 's successful array of models , including the new family car insignia .
the insignia was just voted 2009 car of the year by an international panel of auto journalists .
whether this alone will help boost sales remains to be seen .
" it will take until 2010 before the market gets back to normal , " dudenhoeffer said .
" by then , those manufacturers who present new models with fuel-saving technology will be in the driving seat . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 . " the world financial powers are all in the same boat , " trichet said , adding that joint efforts will have to be made to bring stability to world markets . he added that the fallout was " solvable by joint efforts of authorities and certainly central banks , governments and also the private sector has an essential role to play of course to get out of that situation . " the ecb head noted that the weekend 's g20 financial summit has given " a lot of impetus to speed up the process , and to be as active as possible in implementing what is necessary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members met for a summit in washington the ecb has been providing large amounts of cash to euro-zone banks to enable them to lend to each other again following weeks of uncertainty that dried markets .
in its most recent move , the ecb cut its key lending rate by 0.50 percentage points to 3.25 percent to bolster the 15-nation euro zone , which had entered recession for the first time after shrinking in the second and third quarters of 2008 . meanwhile , economists are expecting the recession to last longer and have a stronger impact than they had originally predicted .
analysts foresee further interest rate cuts by the ecb . earlier this week , following a speech at the royal institute of international affairs in london , trichet was cautious when commenting on euro-zone developments . " i do n't see yet trends of deflation in the euro area , " he said . deflation is characterized by a general fall in prices and the money supply , while inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time . dw staff -lrb- db -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dwindling demand and problems with liquidity have some of the biggest names in the business eyeing a bleak future . there 's a saying in germany that when daimler coughs , the state of baden-wuerttemberg catches pneumonia .
things are not yet quite as bad as that in the home of mercedes-benz , or in germany in general .
but strong medicine is needed to get germany 's ailing car industry back on its feet amid a slump in profits and sales .
the first dose was requested by opel , once the nation 's biggest carmaker , which has been brought to its knees by the massive losses suffered by its us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- .
opel has asked the german government for 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
chancellor angela merkel has promised a decision by the end of december , but insists that any funding would have to stay in germany and not be transferred back to gm .
opel , which employees 27,500 workers at four plants across the country , has already reduced production and sent workers home because not enough people are buying its cars .
similarly , daimler has extended the winter holiday for production staff .
it recently announced that sales in october had slumped 18.1 percent over the year , to 93,900 vehicles .

in the stuttgart region of baden-wuerttemberg , where daimler has its headquarters , 300,000 people depend on the car industry for a living .
porsche and auto supplier bosch also have factories there .
some 100,000 jobs in the industry could disappear by the end of 2009 unless concrete action is taken to shore up the sector , says ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a leading automotive expert at the university of duisburg-essen .
willi diez , a professor at geislingen university 's automobile economics department , believes car manufacturers could slash 25,000 jobs by the middle of next year , with the same number disappearing from companies that supply auto parts .

" it has all happened so quickly .
and if our parent company collapses , then it is all over for us , " said one of the 18,300 workers as he clocked off at the end of shift on monday .
" without opel , we might as well as pack up , " said adnan dayankac , chairman of a local association that includes many foreigners who work for the carmaker .
" the whole city and the surrounding region depend on opel . "
the mood is not much better in the eastern german city of eisenach , where 1,900 workers are employed at a plant that assembles the popular compact model corsa .
production was halted in eisenach for three weeks in october .
many workers are worried that soon there might not be any cars at all coming off the production lines .
" we are afraid general motors will pull us down with it into the abyss , " said harald lieske , who has been with opel since it began production in the east 18 years ago and now heads its workers ' council .

with a limited mandate , their ships can not keep armed bandits from seizing merchant vessels and taking hostages . pirates off the coast of somalia captured another ship on wednesday , nov .
19 .
it is the third vessel since the spectacular hijacking of the saudi supertanker " sirius star " last weekend . although nato , european and us vessels are stationed in the region , they are helpless in effectively battling the increasing problem of piracy - though single operations are sometimes successful . the german navy , for example , said tuesday one of its frigates had foiled attacks on two ships in the gulf of aden , using a helicopter to chase off pirates who fled in their speedboats . larger eu mission launched bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirates usually travel in speedboats nato has four ships on patrol in the waters off somalia , with two protecting un food aid convoys to the troubled horn of africa country .
the mission , nato 's first-ever against pirates , ends in mid-december when the more extensive european union operation " atalanta " begins . " the eu presence will be bigger and more designed for the mission , " said nato spokesman james appathurai . according to the eu , the operation will primarily protect vessels of the world food program and other unarmed merchant ships .
up to six european warships will be present , supported by air patrols . their mandate allows them to use force if necessary against pirates . impossible to monitor somalian coastline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hijacked sirius star is carrying oil worth $ 100 million given that the pirates in the region are well-armed with grenades , heavy machine guns and rocket-launchers , most foreign navies have steered clear of direct confrontation once ships have been hijacked , for fear of putting hostages at risk . somalia 's vast coastline is also virtually impossible to monitor completely , even for modern warships . the hijacking of the " sirius star " occurred near the border to kenya , hundreds of kilometers south of the eu-nato mission 's operational area .
she is the largest vessel ever seized and is carrying 100 million dollars of saudi oil .
the supertanker is now at anchor off puntland , a breakaway northern state in somalia .
nato said it had no intention of intervening or rescuing the ship and crew . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but brussels ' plans have met with criticism in germany . the eu commission would like to ensure that women are better able to combine work and family life .

but brussels ' plans have met with criticism in germany . the eu commission would like to ensure that women are better able to combine work and family life .
to that end , self-employed women are to receive paid maternity leave for the first time . additionally , the commission 's proposals would increase the minimum period of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and recommend paying women 100 percent of their salary beyond the current minimum of paying at least equivalent to sick pay . women would have more flexibility to decide when to take the non-compulsory portion of their leave , either before or after childbirth , and would no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of leave before childbirth , as is presently the case in many member states . for most eu member countries , the proposals are more or less in keeping with the way governments already manage maternity leave .
but in germany , there was outrage when the commission unveiled its plans in early october . many women in germany do n't want to give up their jobs in order to raise children .
under german law , they 're entitled to three years of elternzeit , or parental leave , during which they ca n't be fired from their jobs . but the reality is often different .
employers frequently offer women severance pay if they voluntarily quit instead of opting for leave , and many women who do return to their jobs after maternity leave say they feel that they 're the victims of discrimination . the reality in germany is well known to anne seyferth of the friedrich ebert foundation . " compared to other european countries , germany is not exactly among the leaders when it comes to family politics , " she said .
" if we were , then we would n't have such a low birth rate , such a low rate of working mothers , nor such a relatively high number of children who are growing up in poor families . " reality of parental leave in germany sociological studies have shown the best insurance against child poverty is a mother who can work and earn money .
studies have also proven that there is a correlation between the number of children , and women 's employment status : the more mothers who receive adequate compensation for their work , the higher the birth rate .
this is also the basis for the eu commission 's plan to lengthen the period of paid maternity leave .
ultimately , the goal is to increase economic growth , prosperity and competitiveness in the whole european union . petra schott , who works for the commission in the department for employment , social affairs and equal opportunity , said the changes would be a step in the right direction . " women would have more time to recover after giving birth , " she said .
" they 'd have more time to get to know their child and adjust to life with a newborn . " she added that it could also make it easier for working women to find suitable childcare , which would make returning to work less stressful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fathers need encouragement to spend more time with their children , some experts say in principle , germany 's new " elternzeit " scheme is also supposed to be a step in the right direction .
as in sweden , the option to take parental leave is open to both mothers and fathers . but in germany , less than 1 percent of fathers -lrb- around 4,500 men -rrb- actually take advantage of the option to stay home with their babies for a year , said political scientist peter doege , who conducts research on germans balancing family and work . he said with the new maternity leave proposals , the eu commission is showing that it is only thinking of women , as if they 're the only ones for who struggle to balance the demands of a family and a career .
he added that this does n't reflect today 's changing gender expectations . expectant fathers need to become much more involved in the process of both having and raising children , according to doege . " numerous studies have shown that fathers are more active in child-rearing when they feel that the child is just as much theirs - when they also experience pregnancy , " he said .
" those fathers who , for example , attend birth preparation classes , prove to be much more actively involved once the child is born . " longer maternity leave the solution ? the national association of german employers -lrb- bda -rrb- is against lengthening maternity leave .
renate hornung-draus , head of international social policy at the bda , instead calls for mothers and fathers to take equal advantage of parental leave . " you need to combine it such that neither parent ends up losing touch with the working world , but socially and culturally , we 're still far from that , " she said . employers are instead increasingly campaigning for better daycare options for working parents . " that would mean that parents do n't have to make such a radical ' all or nothing ' choice that is so harmful to job continuity and a true work-life balance , " hornung-draus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say creating better daycare options is the way to go hornung-draus has personally experienced both the german and belgian childcare systems .

" this trial will continue as a closed trial , " said judge yevgeny zubov , who is presiding over the case .
" this is considering the security of the participants in the trial , that of their relatives and their loved ones . "
zubov 's decision came after his ruling on the first day of the trial on monday , when he said the proceedings would be open but that he had the right to close them .
politkovskaya , an award-winning reporter for the novaya gazeta , was a fierce critic of the kremlin 's actions during two wars in chechnya in the early 1990s .
the slain journalist 's family and colleagues have lashed out at the decision .
" i am very disappointed , " a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family , karinna moskalenko , told reporters .
" i think this trial should have been open , not only because all trials should be , but because she was a public figure and the public should know the circumstances of her killing . "
politkovskaya 's son , ilya , said : " of course we do not like the closed trial ...
there is nothing wrong with having journalists there . "
the slain journalist 's family members have sharply criticized the investigation , complaining the defendants on trial are only loosely connected to the contract killing and of the investigation 's secrecy and painstaking progress more than two years after her murder . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this trial will continue as a closed trial , " said judge yevgeny zubov , who is presiding over the case .
" this is considering the security of the participants in the trial , that of their relatives and their loved ones . "
zubov 's decision came after his ruling on the first day of the trial on monday , when he said the proceedings would be open but that he had the right to close them .
politkovskaya , an award-winning reporter for the novaya gazeta , was a fierce critic of the kremlin 's actions during two wars in chechnya in the early 1990s .
the slain journalist 's family and colleagues have lashed out at the decision .
" i am very disappointed , " a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family , karinna moskalenko , told reporters .
" i think this trial should have been open , not only because all trials should be , but because she was a public figure and the public should know the circumstances of her killing . "
politkovskaya 's son , ilya , said : " of course we do not like the closed trial ...

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members met for a summit in washington the ecb has been providing large amounts of cash to euro-zone banks to enable them to lend to each other again following weeks of uncertainty that dried markets .
in its most recent move , the ecb cut its key lending rate by 0.50 percentage points to 3.25 percent to bolster the 15-nation euro zone , which had entered recession for the first time after shrinking in the second and third quarters of 2008 . meanwhile , economists are expecting the recession to last longer and have a stronger impact than they had originally predicted .
analysts foresee further interest rate cuts by the ecb . earlier this week , following a speech at the royal institute of international affairs in london , trichet was cautious when commenting on euro-zone developments . " i do n't see yet trends of deflation in the euro area , " he said . deflation is characterized by a general fall in prices and the money supply , while inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time . dw staff -lrb- db -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dwindling demand and problems with liquidity have some of the biggest names in the business eyeing a bleak future . there 's a saying in germany that when daimler coughs , the state of baden-wuerttemberg catches pneumonia .
things are not yet quite as bad as that in the home of mercedes-benz , or in germany in general .
but strong medicine is needed to get germany 's ailing car industry back on its feet amid a slump in profits and sales .
the first dose was requested by opel , once the nation 's biggest carmaker , which has been brought to its knees by the massive losses suffered by its us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- .
opel has asked the german government for 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
chancellor angela merkel has promised a decision by the end of december , but insists that any funding would have to stay in germany and not be transferred back to gm .
opel , which employees 27,500 workers at four plants across the country , has already reduced production and sent workers home because not enough people are buying its cars .
similarly , daimler has extended the winter holiday for production staff .
it recently announced that sales in october had slumped 18.1 percent over the year , to 93,900 vehicles .
slump in demand sets off warning alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of new cars are all dressed up with nowhere to go the global financial crisis has badly hit demand for new cars , triggering alarm in germany , where an estimated one in six jobs is related to the sector , either directly or indirectly .
in the stuttgart region of baden-wuerttemberg , where daimler has its headquarters , 300,000 people depend on the car industry for a living .
porsche and auto supplier bosch also have factories there .
some 100,000 jobs in the industry could disappear by the end of 2009 unless concrete action is taken to shore up the sector , says ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a leading automotive expert at the university of duisburg-essen .
willi diez , a professor at geislingen university 's automobile economics department , believes car manufacturers could slash 25,000 jobs by the middle of next year , with the same number disappearing from companies that supply auto parts .
workers at faltering opel have much to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel plant in eisenach is currently on life-support car workers are concerned about their future in the 60,000-population city of ruesselsheim , south-west of frankfurt , where opel is by far the biggest employer .
" it has all happened so quickly .
and if our parent company collapses , then it is all over for us , " said one of the 18,300 workers as he clocked off at the end of shift on monday .
" without opel , we might as well as pack up , " said adnan dayankac , chairman of a local association that includes many foreigners who work for the carmaker .
" the whole city and the surrounding region depend on opel . "
the mood is not much better in the eastern german city of eisenach , where 1,900 workers are employed at a plant that assembles the popular compact model corsa .
production was halted in eisenach for three weeks in october .
many workers are worried that soon there might not be any cars at all coming off the production lines .
" we are afraid general motors will pull us down with it into the abyss , " said harald lieske , who has been with opel since it began production in the east 18 years ago and now heads its workers ' council .
glos optimistic of opel survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those are alarm bells you 're hearing , herr glos german economics minister michael glos said he was optimistic that opel would weather the crisis .
he said opel would have been better off had it remained a german-owned company and not become a subsidiary of gm .
glos singled out the opel 's successful array of models , including the new family car insignia .
the insignia was just voted 2009 car of the year by an international panel of auto journalists .
whether this alone will help boost sales remains to be seen .
" it will take until 2010 before the market gets back to normal , " dudenhoeffer said .
" by then , those manufacturers who present new models with fuel-saving technology will be in the driving seat . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dwindling demand and problems with liquidity have some of the biggest names in the business eyeing a bleak future . there 's a saying in germany that when daimler coughs , the state of baden-wuerttemberg catches pneumonia .
things are not yet quite as bad as that in the home of mercedes-benz , or in germany in general .
but strong medicine is needed to get germany 's ailing car industry back on its feet amid a slump in profits and sales .
the first dose was requested by opel , once the nation 's biggest carmaker , which has been brought to its knees by the massive losses suffered by its us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- .
opel has asked the german government for 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
chancellor angela merkel has promised a decision by the end of december , but insists that any funding would have to stay in germany and not be transferred back to gm .
opel , which employees 27,500 workers at four plants across the country , has already reduced production and sent workers home because not enough people are buying its cars .
similarly , daimler has extended the winter holiday for production staff .
it recently announced that sales in october had slumped 18.1 percent over the year , to 93,900 vehicles .
slump in demand sets off warning alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of new cars are all dressed up with nowhere to go the global financial crisis has badly hit demand for new cars , triggering alarm in germany , where an estimated one in six jobs is related to the sector , either directly or indirectly .
in the stuttgart region of baden-wuerttemberg , where daimler has its headquarters , 300,000 people depend on the car industry for a living .
porsche and auto supplier bosch also have factories there .
some 100,000 jobs in the industry could disappear by the end of 2009 unless concrete action is taken to shore up the sector , says ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a leading automotive expert at the university of duisburg-essen .
willi diez , a professor at geislingen university 's automobile economics department , believes car manufacturers could slash 25,000 jobs by the middle of next year , with the same number disappearing from companies that supply auto parts .
workers at faltering opel have much to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel plant in eisenach is currently on life-support car workers are concerned about their future in the 60,000-population city of ruesselsheim , south-west of frankfurt , where opel is by far the biggest employer .
" it has all happened so quickly .
and if our parent company collapses , then it is all over for us , " said one of the 18,300 workers as he clocked off at the end of shift on monday .
" without opel , we might as well as pack up , " said adnan dayankac , chairman of a local association that includes many foreigners who work for the carmaker .
" the whole city and the surrounding region depend on opel . "
the mood is not much better in the eastern german city of eisenach , where 1,900 workers are employed at a plant that assembles the popular compact model corsa .
production was halted in eisenach for three weeks in october .
many workers are worried that soon there might not be any cars at all coming off the production lines .
" we are afraid general motors will pull us down with it into the abyss , " said harald lieske , who has been with opel since it began production in the east 18 years ago and now heads its workers ' council .
glos optimistic of opel survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those are alarm bells you 're hearing , herr glos german economics minister michael glos said he was optimistic that opel would weather the crisis .
he said opel would have been better off had it remained a german-owned company and not become a subsidiary of gm .
glos singled out the opel 's successful array of models , including the new family car insignia .
the insignia was just voted 2009 car of the year by an international panel of auto journalists .
whether this alone will help boost sales remains to be seen .
" it will take until 2010 before the market gets back to normal , " dudenhoeffer said .
" by then , those manufacturers who present new models with fuel-saving technology will be in the driving seat . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.11.2008 ailing german car industry faces job cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's car industry has coughed up some serious problems germany 's ailing car industry faces the prospect of slashing jobs as the global slump hits home .
dwindling demand and problems with liquidity have some of the biggest names in the business eyeing a bleak future . there 's a saying in germany that when daimler coughs , the state of baden-wuerttemberg catches pneumonia .
things are not yet quite as bad as that in the home of mercedes-benz , or in germany in general .
but strong medicine is needed to get germany 's ailing car industry back on its feet amid a slump in profits and sales .
the first dose was requested by opel , once the nation 's biggest carmaker , which has been brought to its knees by the massive losses suffered by its us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- .
opel has asked the german government for 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
chancellor angela merkel has promised a decision by the end of december , but insists that any funding would have to stay in germany and not be transferred back to gm .
opel , which employees 27,500 workers at four plants across the country , has already reduced production and sent workers home because not enough people are buying its cars .
similarly , daimler has extended the winter holiday for production staff .
it recently announced that sales in october had slumped 18.1 percent over the year , to 93,900 vehicles .
slump in demand sets off warning alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of new cars are all dressed up with nowhere to go the global financial crisis has badly hit demand for new cars , triggering alarm in germany , where an estimated one in six jobs is related to the sector , either directly or indirectly .
in the stuttgart region of baden-wuerttemberg , where daimler has its headquarters , 300,000 people depend on the car industry for a living .
porsche and auto supplier bosch also have factories there .
some 100,000 jobs in the industry could disappear by the end of 2009 unless concrete action is taken to shore up the sector , says ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a leading automotive expert at the university of duisburg-essen .
willi diez , a professor at geislingen university 's automobile economics department , believes car manufacturers could slash 25,000 jobs by the middle of next year , with the same number disappearing from companies that supply auto parts .
workers at faltering opel have much to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel plant in eisenach is currently on life-support car workers are concerned about their future in the 60,000-population city of ruesselsheim , south-west of frankfurt , where opel is by far the biggest employer .
" it has all happened so quickly .
and if our parent company collapses , then it is all over for us , " said one of the 18,300 workers as he clocked off at the end of shift on monday .
" without opel , we might as well as pack up , " said adnan dayankac , chairman of a local association that includes many foreigners who work for the carmaker .
" the whole city and the surrounding region depend on opel . "
the mood is not much better in the eastern german city of eisenach , where 1,900 workers are employed at a plant that assembles the popular compact model corsa .
production was halted in eisenach for three weeks in october .
many workers are worried that soon there might not be any cars at all coming off the production lines .
" we are afraid general motors will pull us down with it into the abyss , " said harald lieske , who has been with opel since it began production in the east 18 years ago and now heads its workers ' council .
glos optimistic of opel survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those are alarm bells you 're hearing , herr glos german economics minister michael glos said he was optimistic that opel would weather the crisis .
he said opel would have been better off had it remained a german-owned company and not become a subsidiary of gm .
glos singled out the opel 's successful array of models , including the new family car insignia .
the insignia was just voted 2009 car of the year by an international panel of auto journalists .
whether this alone will help boost sales remains to be seen .
" it will take until 2010 before the market gets back to normal , " dudenhoeffer said .
" by then , those manufacturers who present new models with fuel-saving technology will be in the driving seat . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.11.2008 ailing german car industry faces job cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's car industry has coughed up some serious problems germany 's ailing car industry faces the prospect of slashing jobs as the global slump hits home .
dwindling demand and problems with liquidity have some of the biggest names in the business eyeing a bleak future . there 's a saying in germany that when daimler coughs , the state of baden-wuerttemberg catches pneumonia .
things are not yet quite as bad as that in the home of mercedes-benz , or in germany in general .
but strong medicine is needed to get germany 's ailing car industry back on its feet amid a slump in profits and sales .
the first dose was requested by opel , once the nation 's biggest carmaker , which has been brought to its knees by the massive losses suffered by its us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- .
opel has asked the german government for 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
chancellor angela merkel has promised a decision by the end of december , but insists that any funding would have to stay in germany and not be transferred back to gm .
opel , which employees 27,500 workers at four plants across the country , has already reduced production and sent workers home because not enough people are buying its cars .
similarly , daimler has extended the winter holiday for production staff .
it recently announced that sales in october had slumped 18.1 percent over the year , to 93,900 vehicles .
slump in demand sets off warning alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of new cars are all dressed up with nowhere to go the global financial crisis has badly hit demand for new cars , triggering alarm in germany , where an estimated one in six jobs is related to the sector , either directly or indirectly .
in the stuttgart region of baden-wuerttemberg , where daimler has its headquarters , 300,000 people depend on the car industry for a living .
porsche and auto supplier bosch also have factories there .
some 100,000 jobs in the industry could disappear by the end of 2009 unless concrete action is taken to shore up the sector , says ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a leading automotive expert at the university of duisburg-essen .
willi diez , a professor at geislingen university 's automobile economics department , believes car manufacturers could slash 25,000 jobs by the middle of next year , with the same number disappearing from companies that supply auto parts .
workers at faltering opel have much to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel plant in eisenach is currently on life-support car workers are concerned about their future in the 60,000-population city of ruesselsheim , south-west of frankfurt , where opel is by far the biggest employer .
" it has all happened so quickly .
and if our parent company collapses , then it is all over for us , " said one of the 18,300 workers as he clocked off at the end of shift on monday .
" without opel , we might as well as pack up , " said adnan dayankac , chairman of a local association that includes many foreigners who work for the carmaker .
" the whole city and the surrounding region depend on opel . "
the mood is not much better in the eastern german city of eisenach , where 1,900 workers are employed at a plant that assembles the popular compact model corsa .
production was halted in eisenach for three weeks in october .
many workers are worried that soon there might not be any cars at all coming off the production lines .
" we are afraid general motors will pull us down with it into the abyss , " said harald lieske , who has been with opel since it began production in the east 18 years ago and now heads its workers ' council .
glos optimistic of opel survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those are alarm bells you 're hearing , herr glos german economics minister michael glos said he was optimistic that opel would weather the crisis .
he said opel would have been better off had it remained a german-owned company and not become a subsidiary of gm .
glos singled out the opel 's successful array of models , including the new family car insignia .
the insignia was just voted 2009 car of the year by an international panel of auto journalists .
whether this alone will help boost sales remains to be seen .
" it will take until 2010 before the market gets back to normal , " dudenhoeffer said .
" by then , those manufacturers who present new models with fuel-saving technology will be in the driving seat . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : bailouts fine in moderation the government is set to decide whether to grant ailing german carmaker opel 1 billion euros in credit guarantees .

a david-and-goliath takeover offer for the german factories of general motors sent the share price of the bidding company , solarworld , crashing 16 per cent lower wednesday , nov 19 as gm rejected the one-billion euro bid . solarworld , which assembles and installs smaller electricity generating systems that rely on wind or the sun , asked gm to give it four factories , a german research centre , the opel brand and 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- . the bonn-based company said it would inject an additional 1 billion euros of its own cash and loans to convert opel into " europe 's first green automobile maker , " designing cars with low- emission engines . gm dismisses bid , says opel is not for sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's parent company has no intention of selling us-based general motors promptly rejected the bid .
in detroit , a gm spokesman said opel was not for sale and claims otherwise were " pure speculation . " gm , the world 's biggest automobile manufacturer , took over the adam opel company 80 years ago . solarworld ag , based in bonn , germany , demanded a dowry from general motors of 40,000 euros for each opel employee it took over , amounting to " compensation " of one billion euros . solarworld offered to invest 250 million euros cash in the takeover and raise 750 million euros in bank loans , provided the banks were given a federal government guarantee for the sum . as of early afternoon , solarworld stock was trading at 13.66 euros , down 16 per cent from tuesday 's close in frankfurt . a german government spokesman declined substantive comment on the call for guarantees , saying there was nothing to discuss unless the two companies actually opened negotiations . solarworld chief executive frank asbeck said it was a serious offer .
his company had 1 billion euros in reserve , he added . opel fears based on ailing parent company shares bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dark clouds of bankruptcy gather over opel general motors has seen its share price plunge amid bankruptcy fears .
opel has asked for german state aid , but german politicians have been reluctant to help in a way that indirectly benefits the parent . solarworld has a payroll of 2,254 people .
opel , with its main office in a frankfurt suburb , has more than 10 times as many .
opel was not in a position to immediately give a reaction to the solarworld statement , a spokeswoman told reporters .
the german automaker has been hit by slumping sales and financial problems at its parent company , and has asked the german government for loan guarantees in the event it can no longer obtain financing from gm .
eu commissioner calls opel a " special case " as the discussion about state aid for the ailing german carmaker opel continued , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen described the firm as a " special case " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is one of the car firms queuing up for state aid " extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
however , he said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , verheugen said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .

dwindling demand and problems with liquidity have some of the biggest names in the business eyeing a bleak future . there 's a saying in germany that when daimler coughs , the state of baden-wuerttemberg catches pneumonia .
things are not yet quite as bad as that in the home of mercedes-benz , or in germany in general .
but strong medicine is needed to get germany 's ailing car industry back on its feet amid a slump in profits and sales .
the first dose was requested by opel , once the nation 's biggest carmaker , which has been brought to its knees by the massive losses suffered by its us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- .
opel has asked the german government for 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
chancellor angela merkel has promised a decision by the end of december , but insists that any funding would have to stay in germany and not be transferred back to gm .
opel , which employees 27,500 workers at four plants across the country , has already reduced production and sent workers home because not enough people are buying its cars .
similarly , daimler has extended the winter holiday for production staff .
it recently announced that sales in october had slumped 18.1 percent over the year , to 93,900 vehicles .
slump in demand sets off warning alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of new cars are all dressed up with nowhere to go the global financial crisis has badly hit demand for new cars , triggering alarm in germany , where an estimated one in six jobs is related to the sector , either directly or indirectly .
in the stuttgart region of baden-wuerttemberg , where daimler has its headquarters , 300,000 people depend on the car industry for a living .
porsche and auto supplier bosch also have factories there .
some 100,000 jobs in the industry could disappear by the end of 2009 unless concrete action is taken to shore up the sector , says ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a leading automotive expert at the university of duisburg-essen .
willi diez , a professor at geislingen university 's automobile economics department , believes car manufacturers could slash 25,000 jobs by the middle of next year , with the same number disappearing from companies that supply auto parts .
workers at faltering opel have much to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel plant in eisenach is currently on life-support car workers are concerned about their future in the 60,000-population city of ruesselsheim , south-west of frankfurt , where opel is by far the biggest employer .
" it has all happened so quickly .
and if our parent company collapses , then it is all over for us , " said one of the 18,300 workers as he clocked off at the end of shift on monday .
" without opel , we might as well as pack up , " said adnan dayankac , chairman of a local association that includes many foreigners who work for the carmaker .
" the whole city and the surrounding region depend on opel . "
the mood is not much better in the eastern german city of eisenach , where 1,900 workers are employed at a plant that assembles the popular compact model corsa .
production was halted in eisenach for three weeks in october .
many workers are worried that soon there might not be any cars at all coming off the production lines .
" we are afraid general motors will pull us down with it into the abyss , " said harald lieske , who has been with opel since it began production in the east 18 years ago and now heads its workers ' council .
glos optimistic of opel survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those are alarm bells you 're hearing , herr glos german economics minister michael glos said he was optimistic that opel would weather the crisis .
he said opel would have been better off had it remained a german-owned company and not become a subsidiary of gm .
glos singled out the opel 's successful array of models , including the new family car insignia .
the insignia was just voted 2009 car of the year by an international panel of auto journalists .
whether this alone will help boost sales remains to be seen .
" it will take until 2010 before the market gets back to normal , " dudenhoeffer said .
" by then , those manufacturers who present new models with fuel-saving technology will be in the driving seat . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we want them to reach a result very quickly , " jouyet said .
he said the eu was willing to increase its financial contribution to the un in order to help stabilize the region . industry 's responsibility to dr congo according to ferrero-waldner , monuc needed more power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masisi region contains important deposits of coltan " the mandate should be extended , for example , in terms of its control over the pillaging of natural resources , " she said .
monuc forces have come under criticism for failing to do enough to stop the violence . ferrero-waldner said she was " very pleased " with the latest diplomatic efforts by other african countries and individuals .
but now it was " high time to analyze the real causes for the crisis , " she said .
this included looting mines and oppressing minorities . several members of the european parliament said international companies should also be made to accept responsibility for controlling the exploitation of dr congo 's natural resources .
the country 's diamonds , zinc , gold and coltan are used in the communications and consumer electronics industries . nkunda 's ambitious plans rebel chief laurent nkunda told the german weekly die zeit he wanted to extend his control to include the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general nkunda aims to take over the whole of congo " under my leadership , the dr congo will be sitting in the un security council representing africa within five years time , " nkunda said in an interview published wednesday . he accused the current government of failure , saying it had sold out the country to the chinese and cooperated with " criminals . " nkunda has promised to take action against the ever-present corruption in dr congo and make it an internationally recognized country . the un mission in dr congo said wednesday that nkunda 's rebels had started withdrawing from conflict zones around two towns in the east of the country .
more than 250,000 people have been displaced since fighting erupted between nkunda 's rebels and the military in nord-kivu province in late august . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 19.11.2008 germany criticizes eu changes to maternity leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say the proposals focus on women the eu commission would like to make it easier for new mothers to return to the workplace by providing longer and better paid maternity leave .
but brussels ' plans have met with criticism in germany . the eu commission would like to ensure that women are better able to combine work and family life .
to that end , self-employed women are to receive paid maternity leave for the first time . additionally , the commission 's proposals would increase the minimum period of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and recommend paying women 100 percent of their salary beyond the current minimum of paying at least equivalent to sick pay . women would have more flexibility to decide when to take the non-compulsory portion of their leave , either before or after childbirth , and would no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of leave before childbirth , as is presently the case in many member states . for most eu member countries , the proposals are more or less in keeping with the way governments already manage maternity leave .
but in germany , there was outrage when the commission unveiled its plans in early october . many women in germany do n't want to give up their jobs in order to raise children .
under german law , they 're entitled to three years of elternzeit , or parental leave , during which they ca n't be fired from their jobs . but the reality is often different .
employers frequently offer women severance pay if they voluntarily quit instead of opting for leave , and many women who do return to their jobs after maternity leave say they feel that they 're the victims of discrimination . the reality in germany is well known to anne seyferth of the friedrich ebert foundation . " compared to other european countries , germany is not exactly among the leaders when it comes to family politics , " she said .
" if we were , then we would n't have such a low birth rate , such a low rate of working mothers , nor such a relatively high number of children who are growing up in poor families . " reality of parental leave in germany sociological studies have shown the best insurance against child poverty is a mother who can work and earn money .
studies have also proven that there is a correlation between the number of children , and women 's employment status : the more mothers who receive adequate compensation for their work , the higher the birth rate .
this is also the basis for the eu commission 's plan to lengthen the period of paid maternity leave .
ultimately , the goal is to increase economic growth , prosperity and competitiveness in the whole european union . petra schott , who works for the commission in the department for employment , social affairs and equal opportunity , said the changes would be a step in the right direction . " women would have more time to recover after giving birth , " she said .
" they 'd have more time to get to know their child and adjust to life with a newborn . " she added that it could also make it easier for working women to find suitable childcare , which would make returning to work less stressful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fathers need encouragement to spend more time with their children , some experts say in principle , germany 's new " elternzeit " scheme is also supposed to be a step in the right direction .
as in sweden , the option to take parental leave is open to both mothers and fathers . but in germany , less than 1 percent of fathers -lrb- around 4,500 men -rrb- actually take advantage of the option to stay home with their babies for a year , said political scientist peter doege , who conducts research on germans balancing family and work . he said with the new maternity leave proposals , the eu commission is showing that it is only thinking of women , as if they 're the only ones for who struggle to balance the demands of a family and a career .
he added that this does n't reflect today 's changing gender expectations . expectant fathers need to become much more involved in the process of both having and raising children , according to doege . " numerous studies have shown that fathers are more active in child-rearing when they feel that the child is just as much theirs - when they also experience pregnancy , " he said .
" those fathers who , for example , attend birth preparation classes , prove to be much more actively involved once the child is born . " longer maternity leave the solution ? the national association of german employers -lrb- bda -rrb- is against lengthening maternity leave .
renate hornung-draus , head of international social policy at the bda , instead calls for mothers and fathers to take equal advantage of parental leave . " you need to combine it such that neither parent ends up losing touch with the working world , but socially and culturally , we 're still far from that , " she said . employers are instead increasingly campaigning for better daycare options for working parents . " that would mean that parents do n't have to make such a radical ' all or nothing ' choice that is so harmful to job continuity and a true work-life balance , " hornung-draus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say creating better daycare options is the way to go hornung-draus has personally experienced both the german and belgian childcare systems .
in germany , it is still assumed that mothers carry the primary care responsibility , whereas in belgium , children are given adequate care and both parents are able to concentrate on their jobs . but maria kathmann from the german unions ' federaton -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said it 's employers who need to change their attitude the most . " if you look at the situation in eastern germany right now , only 57 percent of under-three-year-olds are in daycare , " she said . if you talk with works council representatives or employees , she added , time and again you hear that people have huge problems trying to combine work and family life . kathmann said hiring policies also need to be changed .

but brussels ' plans have met with criticism in germany . the eu commission would like to ensure that women are better able to combine work and family life .
to that end , self-employed women are to receive paid maternity leave for the first time . additionally , the commission 's proposals would increase the minimum period of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and recommend paying women 100 percent of their salary beyond the current minimum of paying at least equivalent to sick pay . women would have more flexibility to decide when to take the non-compulsory portion of their leave , either before or after childbirth , and would no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of leave before childbirth , as is presently the case in many member states . for most eu member countries , the proposals are more or less in keeping with the way governments already manage maternity leave .
but in germany , there was outrage when the commission unveiled its plans in early october . many women in germany do n't want to give up their jobs in order to raise children .
under german law , they 're entitled to three years of elternzeit , or parental leave , during which they ca n't be fired from their jobs . but the reality is often different .
employers frequently offer women severance pay if they voluntarily quit instead of opting for leave , and many women who do return to their jobs after maternity leave say they feel that they 're the victims of discrimination . the reality in germany is well known to anne seyferth of the friedrich ebert foundation . " compared to other european countries , germany is not exactly among the leaders when it comes to family politics , " she said .
" if we were , then we would n't have such a low birth rate , such a low rate of working mothers , nor such a relatively high number of children who are growing up in poor families . " reality of parental leave in germany sociological studies have shown the best insurance against child poverty is a mother who can work and earn money .
studies have also proven that there is a correlation between the number of children , and women 's employment status : the more mothers who receive adequate compensation for their work , the higher the birth rate .
this is also the basis for the eu commission 's plan to lengthen the period of paid maternity leave .
ultimately , the goal is to increase economic growth , prosperity and competitiveness in the whole european union . petra schott , who works for the commission in the department for employment , social affairs and equal opportunity , said the changes would be a step in the right direction . " women would have more time to recover after giving birth , " she said .
" they 'd have more time to get to know their child and adjust to life with a newborn . " she added that it could also make it easier for working women to find suitable childcare , which would make returning to work less stressful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fathers need encouragement to spend more time with their children , some experts say in principle , germany 's new " elternzeit " scheme is also supposed to be a step in the right direction .
as in sweden , the option to take parental leave is open to both mothers and fathers . but in germany , less than 1 percent of fathers -lrb- around 4,500 men -rrb- actually take advantage of the option to stay home with their babies for a year , said political scientist peter doege , who conducts research on germans balancing family and work . he said with the new maternity leave proposals , the eu commission is showing that it is only thinking of women , as if they 're the only ones for who struggle to balance the demands of a family and a career .
he added that this does n't reflect today 's changing gender expectations . expectant fathers need to become much more involved in the process of both having and raising children , according to doege . " numerous studies have shown that fathers are more active in child-rearing when they feel that the child is just as much theirs - when they also experience pregnancy , " he said .
" those fathers who , for example , attend birth preparation classes , prove to be much more actively involved once the child is born . " longer maternity leave the solution ? the national association of german employers -lrb- bda -rrb- is against lengthening maternity leave .
renate hornung-draus , head of international social policy at the bda , instead calls for mothers and fathers to take equal advantage of parental leave . " you need to combine it such that neither parent ends up losing touch with the working world , but socially and culturally , we 're still far from that , " she said . employers are instead increasingly campaigning for better daycare options for working parents . " that would mean that parents do n't have to make such a radical ' all or nothing ' choice that is so harmful to job continuity and a true work-life balance , " hornung-draus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say creating better daycare options is the way to go hornung-draus has personally experienced both the german and belgian childcare systems .

dwindling demand and problems with liquidity have some of the biggest names in the business eyeing a bleak future . there 's a saying in germany that when daimler coughs , the state of baden-wuerttemberg catches pneumonia .
things are not yet quite as bad as that in the home of mercedes-benz , or in germany in general .
but strong medicine is needed to get germany 's ailing car industry back on its feet amid a slump in profits and sales .
the first dose was requested by opel , once the nation 's biggest carmaker , which has been brought to its knees by the massive losses suffered by its us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- .
opel has asked the german government for 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
chancellor angela merkel has promised a decision by the end of december , but insists that any funding would have to stay in germany and not be transferred back to gm .
opel , which employees 27,500 workers at four plants across the country , has already reduced production and sent workers home because not enough people are buying its cars .
similarly , daimler has extended the winter holiday for production staff .
it recently announced that sales in october had slumped 18.1 percent over the year , to 93,900 vehicles .
slump in demand sets off warning alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of new cars are all dressed up with nowhere to go the global financial crisis has badly hit demand for new cars , triggering alarm in germany , where an estimated one in six jobs is related to the sector , either directly or indirectly .
in the stuttgart region of baden-wuerttemberg , where daimler has its headquarters , 300,000 people depend on the car industry for a living .
porsche and auto supplier bosch also have factories there .
some 100,000 jobs in the industry could disappear by the end of 2009 unless concrete action is taken to shore up the sector , says ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a leading automotive expert at the university of duisburg-essen .
willi diez , a professor at geislingen university 's automobile economics department , believes car manufacturers could slash 25,000 jobs by the middle of next year , with the same number disappearing from companies that supply auto parts .
workers at faltering opel have much to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel plant in eisenach is currently on life-support car workers are concerned about their future in the 60,000-population city of ruesselsheim , south-west of frankfurt , where opel is by far the biggest employer .

monuc forces have come under criticism for failing to do enough to stop the violence . ferrero-waldner said she was " very pleased " with the latest diplomatic efforts by other african countries and individuals .
but now it was " high time to analyze the real causes for the crisis , " she said .
this included looting mines and oppressing minorities . several members of the european parliament said international companies should also be made to accept responsibility for controlling the exploitation of dr congo 's natural resources .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 19.11.2008 germany criticizes eu changes to maternity leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say the proposals focus on women the eu commission would like to make it easier for new mothers to return to the workplace by providing longer and better paid maternity leave .
but brussels ' plans have met with criticism in germany . the eu commission would like to ensure that women are better able to combine work and family life .
to that end , self-employed women are to receive paid maternity leave for the first time . additionally , the commission 's proposals would increase the minimum period of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and recommend paying women 100 percent of their salary beyond the current minimum of paying at least equivalent to sick pay . women would have more flexibility to decide when to take the non-compulsory portion of their leave , either before or after childbirth , and would no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of leave before childbirth , as is presently the case in many member states . for most eu member countries , the proposals are more or less in keeping with the way governments already manage maternity leave .
but in germany , there was outrage when the commission unveiled its plans in early october . many women in germany do n't want to give up their jobs in order to raise children .
under german law , they 're entitled to three years of elternzeit , or parental leave , during which they ca n't be fired from their jobs . but the reality is often different .
employers frequently offer women severance pay if they voluntarily quit instead of opting for leave , and many women who do return to their jobs after maternity leave say they feel that they 're the victims of discrimination . the reality in germany is well known to anne seyferth of the friedrich ebert foundation . " compared to other european countries , germany is not exactly among the leaders when it comes to family politics , " she said .
" if we were , then we would n't have such a low birth rate , such a low rate of working mothers , nor such a relatively high number of children who are growing up in poor families . " reality of parental leave in germany sociological studies have shown the best insurance against child poverty is a mother who can work and earn money .
studies have also proven that there is a correlation between the number of children , and women 's employment status : the more mothers who receive adequate compensation for their work , the higher the birth rate .
this is also the basis for the eu commission 's plan to lengthen the period of paid maternity leave .
ultimately , the goal is to increase economic growth , prosperity and competitiveness in the whole european union . petra schott , who works for the commission in the department for employment , social affairs and equal opportunity , said the changes would be a step in the right direction . " women would have more time to recover after giving birth , " she said .
" they 'd have more time to get to know their child and adjust to life with a newborn . " she added that it could also make it easier for working women to find suitable childcare , which would make returning to work less stressful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fathers need encouragement to spend more time with their children , some experts say in principle , germany 's new " elternzeit " scheme is also supposed to be a step in the right direction .
as in sweden , the option to take parental leave is open to both mothers and fathers . but in germany , less than 1 percent of fathers -lrb- around 4,500 men -rrb- actually take advantage of the option to stay home with their babies for a year , said political scientist peter doege , who conducts research on germans balancing family and work . he said with the new maternity leave proposals , the eu commission is showing that it is only thinking of women , as if they 're the only ones for who struggle to balance the demands of a family and a career .
he added that this does n't reflect today 's changing gender expectations . expectant fathers need to become much more involved in the process of both having and raising children , according to doege . " numerous studies have shown that fathers are more active in child-rearing when they feel that the child is just as much theirs - when they also experience pregnancy , " he said .
" those fathers who , for example , attend birth preparation classes , prove to be much more actively involved once the child is born . " longer maternity leave the solution ? the national association of german employers -lrb- bda -rrb- is against lengthening maternity leave .
renate hornung-draus , head of international social policy at the bda , instead calls for mothers and fathers to take equal advantage of parental leave . " you need to combine it such that neither parent ends up losing touch with the working world , but socially and culturally , we 're still far from that , " she said . employers are instead increasingly campaigning for better daycare options for working parents . " that would mean that parents do n't have to make such a radical ' all or nothing ' choice that is so harmful to job continuity and a true work-life balance , " hornung-draus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say creating better daycare options is the way to go hornung-draus has personally experienced both the german and belgian childcare systems .
in germany , it is still assumed that mothers carry the primary care responsibility , whereas in belgium , children are given adequate care and both parents are able to concentrate on their jobs . but maria kathmann from the german unions ' federaton -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said it 's employers who need to change their attitude the most . " if you look at the situation in eastern germany right now , only 57 percent of under-three-year-olds are in daycare , " she said . if you talk with works council representatives or employees , she added , time and again you hear that people have huge problems trying to combine work and family life . kathmann said hiring policies also need to be changed . " it has a lot to do with the current employment culture of presence and showing your face , and with the expectation from employers to first select staff members who have nothing else going on in the background .

19 . " the world financial powers are all in the same boat , " trichet said , adding that joint efforts will have to be made to bring stability to world markets . he added that the fallout was " solvable by joint efforts of authorities and certainly central banks , governments and also the private sector has an essential role to play of course to get out of that situation . " the ecb head noted that the weekend 's g20 financial summit has given " a lot of impetus to speed up the process , and to be as active as possible in implementing what is necessary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members met for a summit in washington the ecb has been providing large amounts of cash to euro-zone banks to enable them to lend to each other again following weeks of uncertainty that dried markets .
in its most recent move , the ecb cut its key lending rate by 0.50 percentage points to 3.25 percent to bolster the 15-nation euro zone , which had entered recession for the first time after shrinking in the second and third quarters of 2008 . meanwhile , economists are expecting the recession to last longer and have a stronger impact than they had originally predicted .
analysts foresee further interest rate cuts by the ecb . earlier this week , following a speech at the royal institute of international affairs in london , trichet was cautious when commenting on euro-zone developments . " i do n't see yet trends of deflation in the euro area , " he said . deflation is characterized by a general fall in prices and the money supply , while inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time . dw staff -lrb- db -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dwindling demand and problems with liquidity have some of the biggest names in the business eyeing a bleak future . there 's a saying in germany that when daimler coughs , the state of baden-wuerttemberg catches pneumonia .
things are not yet quite as bad as that in the home of mercedes-benz , or in germany in general .
but strong medicine is needed to get germany 's ailing car industry back on its feet amid a slump in profits and sales .
the first dose was requested by opel , once the nation 's biggest carmaker , which has been brought to its knees by the massive losses suffered by its us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- .
opel has asked the german government for 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
chancellor angela merkel has promised a decision by the end of december , but insists that any funding would have to stay in germany and not be transferred back to gm .
opel , which employees 27,500 workers at four plants across the country , has already reduced production and sent workers home because not enough people are buying its cars .
similarly , daimler has extended the winter holiday for production staff .
it recently announced that sales in october had slumped 18.1 percent over the year , to 93,900 vehicles .

" without opel , we might as well as pack up , " said adnan dayankac , chairman of a local association that includes many foreigners who work for the carmaker .
" the whole city and the surrounding region depend on opel . "
the mood is not much better in the eastern german city of eisenach , where 1,900 workers are employed at a plant that assembles the popular compact model corsa .
production was halted in eisenach for three weeks in october .
many workers are worried that soon there might not be any cars at all coming off the production lines .
" we are afraid general motors will pull us down with it into the abyss , " said harald lieske , who has been with opel since it began production in the east 18 years ago and now heads its workers ' council .

glos singled out the opel 's successful array of models , including the new family car insignia .
the insignia was just voted 2009 car of the year by an international panel of auto journalists .
whether this alone will help boost sales remains to be seen .

dwindling demand and problems with liquidity have some of the biggest names in the business eyeing a bleak future . there 's a saying in germany that when daimler coughs , the state of baden-wuerttemberg catches pneumonia .
things are not yet quite as bad as that in the home of mercedes-benz , or in germany in general .
but strong medicine is needed to get germany 's ailing car industry back on its feet amid a slump in profits and sales .
the first dose was requested by opel , once the nation 's biggest carmaker , which has been brought to its knees by the massive losses suffered by its us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- .
opel has asked the german government for 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
chancellor angela merkel has promised a decision by the end of december , but insists that any funding would have to stay in germany and not be transferred back to gm .
opel , which employees 27,500 workers at four plants across the country , has already reduced production and sent workers home because not enough people are buying its cars .
similarly , daimler has extended the winter holiday for production staff .
it recently announced that sales in october had slumped 18.1 percent over the year , to 93,900 vehicles .
slump in demand sets off warning alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of new cars are all dressed up with nowhere to go the global financial crisis has badly hit demand for new cars , triggering alarm in germany , where an estimated one in six jobs is related to the sector , either directly or indirectly .
in the stuttgart region of baden-wuerttemberg , where daimler has its headquarters , 300,000 people depend on the car industry for a living .
porsche and auto supplier bosch also have factories there .
some 100,000 jobs in the industry could disappear by the end of 2009 unless concrete action is taken to shore up the sector , says ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a leading automotive expert at the university of duisburg-essen .
willi diez , a professor at geislingen university 's automobile economics department , believes car manufacturers could slash 25,000 jobs by the middle of next year , with the same number disappearing from companies that supply auto parts .
workers at faltering opel have much to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel plant in eisenach is currently on life-support car workers are concerned about their future in the 60,000-population city of ruesselsheim , south-west of frankfurt , where opel is by far the biggest employer .
" it has all happened so quickly .
and if our parent company collapses , then it is all over for us , " said one of the 18,300 workers as he clocked off at the end of shift on monday .
" without opel , we might as well as pack up , " said adnan dayankac , chairman of a local association that includes many foreigners who work for the carmaker .
" the whole city and the surrounding region depend on opel . "
the mood is not much better in the eastern german city of eisenach , where 1,900 workers are employed at a plant that assembles the popular compact model corsa .
production was halted in eisenach for three weeks in october .
many workers are worried that soon there might not be any cars at all coming off the production lines .
" we are afraid general motors will pull us down with it into the abyss , " said harald lieske , who has been with opel since it began production in the east 18 years ago and now heads its workers ' council .
glos optimistic of opel survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those are alarm bells you 're hearing , herr glos german economics minister michael glos said he was optimistic that opel would weather the crisis .

" we want them to reach a result very quickly , " jouyet said .

but now it was " high time to analyze the real causes for the crisis , " she said .
this included looting mines and oppressing minorities . several members of the european parliament said international companies should also be made to accept responsibility for controlling the exploitation of dr congo 's natural resources .
the country 's diamonds , zinc , gold and coltan are used in the communications and consumer electronics industries . nkunda 's ambitious plans rebel chief laurent nkunda told the german weekly die zeit he wanted to extend his control to include the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general nkunda aims to take over the whole of congo " under my leadership , the dr congo will be sitting in the un security council representing africa within five years time , " nkunda said in an interview published wednesday . he accused the current government of failure , saying it had sold out the country to the chinese and cooperated with " criminals . " nkunda has promised to take action against the ever-present corruption in dr congo and make it an internationally recognized country . the un mission in dr congo said wednesday that nkunda 's rebels had started withdrawing from conflict zones around two towns in the east of the country .

the french eu presidency , however , said a military solution was not the answer . the crisis in the democratic republic of congo should be resolved by a " balanced political solution based on dialog , " according to the european union . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and french european affairs minister jean-pierre jouyet said a further dialog had to include the un , the eu , the african union as well as regional african organizations .
both politicians were speaking before the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , nov .

" we want them to reach a result very quickly , " jouyet said .
he said the eu was willing to increase its financial contribution to the un in order to help stabilize the region . industry 's responsibility to dr congo according to ferrero-waldner , monuc needed more power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masisi region contains important deposits of coltan " the mandate should be extended , for example , in terms of its control over the pillaging of natural resources , " she said .
monuc forces have come under criticism for failing to do enough to stop the violence . ferrero-waldner said she was " very pleased " with the latest diplomatic efforts by other african countries and individuals .
but now it was " high time to analyze the real causes for the crisis , " she said .
this included looting mines and oppressing minorities . several members of the european parliament said international companies should also be made to accept responsibility for controlling the exploitation of dr congo 's natural resources .
the country 's diamonds , zinc , gold and coltan are used in the communications and consumer electronics industries . nkunda 's ambitious plans rebel chief laurent nkunda told the german weekly die zeit he wanted to extend his control to include the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general nkunda aims to take over the whole of congo " under my leadership , the dr congo will be sitting in the un security council representing africa within five years time , " nkunda said in an interview published wednesday . he accused the current government of failure , saying it had sold out the country to the chinese and cooperated with " criminals . " nkunda has promised to take action against the ever-present corruption in dr congo and make it an internationally recognized country . the un mission in dr congo said wednesday that nkunda 's rebels had started withdrawing from conflict zones around two towns in the east of the country .
more than 250,000 people have been displaced since fighting erupted between nkunda 's rebels and the military in nord-kivu province in late august . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the french eu presidency , however , said a military solution was not the answer . the crisis in the democratic republic of congo should be resolved by a " balanced political solution based on dialog , " according to the european union . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and french european affairs minister jean-pierre jouyet said a further dialog had to include the un , the eu , the african union as well as regional african organizations .
both politicians were speaking before the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , nov .

" we want them to reach a result very quickly , " jouyet said .
he said the eu was willing to increase its financial contribution to the un in order to help stabilize the region . industry 's responsibility to dr congo according to ferrero-waldner , monuc needed more power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masisi region contains important deposits of coltan " the mandate should be extended , for example , in terms of its control over the pillaging of natural resources , " she said .
monuc forces have come under criticism for failing to do enough to stop the violence . ferrero-waldner said she was " very pleased " with the latest diplomatic efforts by other african countries and individuals .
but now it was " high time to analyze the real causes for the crisis , " she said .
this included looting mines and oppressing minorities . several members of the european parliament said international companies should also be made to accept responsibility for controlling the exploitation of dr congo 's natural resources .
the country 's diamonds , zinc , gold and coltan are used in the communications and consumer electronics industries . nkunda 's ambitious plans rebel chief laurent nkunda told the german weekly die zeit he wanted to extend his control to include the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general nkunda aims to take over the whole of congo " under my leadership , the dr congo will be sitting in the un security council representing africa within five years time , " nkunda said in an interview published wednesday . he accused the current government of failure , saying it had sold out the country to the chinese and cooperated with " criminals . " nkunda has promised to take action against the ever-present corruption in dr congo and make it an internationally recognized country . the un mission in dr congo said wednesday that nkunda 's rebels had started withdrawing from conflict zones around two towns in the east of the country .
more than 250,000 people have been displaced since fighting erupted between nkunda 's rebels and the military in nord-kivu province in late august . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dwindling demand and problems with liquidity have some of the biggest names in the business eyeing a bleak future . there 's a saying in germany that when daimler coughs , the state of baden-wuerttemberg catches pneumonia .
things are not yet quite as bad as that in the home of mercedes-benz , or in germany in general .
but strong medicine is needed to get germany 's ailing car industry back on its feet amid a slump in profits and sales .
the first dose was requested by opel , once the nation 's biggest carmaker , which has been brought to its knees by the massive losses suffered by its us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- .
opel has asked the german government for 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
chancellor angela merkel has promised a decision by the end of december , but insists that any funding would have to stay in germany and not be transferred back to gm .
opel , which employees 27,500 workers at four plants across the country , has already reduced production and sent workers home because not enough people are buying its cars .
similarly , daimler has extended the winter holiday for production staff .
it recently announced that sales in october had slumped 18.1 percent over the year , to 93,900 vehicles .
slump in demand sets off warning alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of new cars are all dressed up with nowhere to go the global financial crisis has badly hit demand for new cars , triggering alarm in germany , where an estimated one in six jobs is related to the sector , either directly or indirectly .
in the stuttgart region of baden-wuerttemberg , where daimler has its headquarters , 300,000 people depend on the car industry for a living .
porsche and auto supplier bosch also have factories there .
some 100,000 jobs in the industry could disappear by the end of 2009 unless concrete action is taken to shore up the sector , says ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a leading automotive expert at the university of duisburg-essen .
willi diez , a professor at geislingen university 's automobile economics department , believes car manufacturers could slash 25,000 jobs by the middle of next year , with the same number disappearing from companies that supply auto parts .
workers at faltering opel have much to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel plant in eisenach is currently on life-support car workers are concerned about their future in the 60,000-population city of ruesselsheim , south-west of frankfurt , where opel is by far the biggest employer .
" it has all happened so quickly .
and if our parent company collapses , then it is all over for us , " said one of the 18,300 workers as he clocked off at the end of shift on monday .
" without opel , we might as well as pack up , " said adnan dayankac , chairman of a local association that includes many foreigners who work for the carmaker .
" the whole city and the surrounding region depend on opel . "
the mood is not much better in the eastern german city of eisenach , where 1,900 workers are employed at a plant that assembles the popular compact model corsa .
production was halted in eisenach for three weeks in october .
many workers are worried that soon there might not be any cars at all coming off the production lines .
" we are afraid general motors will pull us down with it into the abyss , " said harald lieske , who has been with opel since it began production in the east 18 years ago and now heads its workers ' council .
glos optimistic of opel survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those are alarm bells you 're hearing , herr glos german economics minister michael glos said he was optimistic that opel would weather the crisis .
he said opel would have been better off had it remained a german-owned company and not become a subsidiary of gm .
glos singled out the opel 's successful array of models , including the new family car insignia .
the insignia was just voted 2009 car of the year by an international panel of auto journalists .
whether this alone will help boost sales remains to be seen .
" it will take until 2010 before the market gets back to normal , " dudenhoeffer said .
" by then , those manufacturers who present new models with fuel-saving technology will be in the driving seat . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opel has asked the german government for 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
chancellor angela merkel has promised a decision by the end of december , but insists that any funding would have to stay in germany and not be transferred back to gm .
opel , which employees 27,500 workers at four plants across the country , has already reduced production and sent workers home because not enough people are buying its cars .
similarly , daimler has extended the winter holiday for production staff .
it recently announced that sales in october had slumped 18.1 percent over the year , to 93,900 vehicles .
slump in demand sets off warning alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of new cars are all dressed up with nowhere to go the global financial crisis has badly hit demand for new cars , triggering alarm in germany , where an estimated one in six jobs is related to the sector , either directly or indirectly .
in the stuttgart region of baden-wuerttemberg , where daimler has its headquarters , 300,000 people depend on the car industry for a living .
porsche and auto supplier bosch also have factories there .
some 100,000 jobs in the industry could disappear by the end of 2009 unless concrete action is taken to shore up the sector , says ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a leading automotive expert at the university of duisburg-essen .
willi diez , a professor at geislingen university 's automobile economics department , believes car manufacturers could slash 25,000 jobs by the middle of next year , with the same number disappearing from companies that supply auto parts .

" it has all happened so quickly .
and if our parent company collapses , then it is all over for us , " said one of the 18,300 workers as he clocked off at the end of shift on monday .
" without opel , we might as well as pack up , " said adnan dayankac , chairman of a local association that includes many foreigners who work for the carmaker .
" the whole city and the surrounding region depend on opel . "
the mood is not much better in the eastern german city of eisenach , where 1,900 workers are employed at a plant that assembles the popular compact model corsa .
production was halted in eisenach for three weeks in october .
many workers are worried that soon there might not be any cars at all coming off the production lines .
" we are afraid general motors will pull us down with it into the abyss , " said harald lieske , who has been with opel since it began production in the east 18 years ago and now heads its workers ' council .
glos optimistic of opel survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those are alarm bells you 're hearing , herr glos german economics minister michael glos said he was optimistic that opel would weather the crisis .

but brussels ' plans have met with criticism in germany . the eu commission would like to ensure that women are better able to combine work and family life .
to that end , self-employed women are to receive paid maternity leave for the first time . additionally , the commission 's proposals would increase the minimum period of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and recommend paying women 100 percent of their salary beyond the current minimum of paying at least equivalent to sick pay . women would have more flexibility to decide when to take the non-compulsory portion of their leave , either before or after childbirth , and would no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of leave before childbirth , as is presently the case in many member states . for most eu member countries , the proposals are more or less in keeping with the way governments already manage maternity leave .
but in germany , there was outrage when the commission unveiled its plans in early october . many women in germany do n't want to give up their jobs in order to raise children .
under german law , they 're entitled to three years of elternzeit , or parental leave , during which they ca n't be fired from their jobs . but the reality is often different .
employers frequently offer women severance pay if they voluntarily quit instead of opting for leave , and many women who do return to their jobs after maternity leave say they feel that they 're the victims of discrimination . the reality in germany is well known to anne seyferth of the friedrich ebert foundation . " compared to other european countries , germany is not exactly among the leaders when it comes to family politics , " she said .
" if we were , then we would n't have such a low birth rate , such a low rate of working mothers , nor such a relatively high number of children who are growing up in poor families . " reality of parental leave in germany sociological studies have shown the best insurance against child poverty is a mother who can work and earn money .
studies have also proven that there is a correlation between the number of children , and women 's employment status : the more mothers who receive adequate compensation for their work , the higher the birth rate .
this is also the basis for the eu commission 's plan to lengthen the period of paid maternity leave .
ultimately , the goal is to increase economic growth , prosperity and competitiveness in the whole european union . petra schott , who works for the commission in the department for employment , social affairs and equal opportunity , said the changes would be a step in the right direction . " women would have more time to recover after giving birth , " she said .
" they 'd have more time to get to know their child and adjust to life with a newborn . " she added that it could also make it easier for working women to find suitable childcare , which would make returning to work less stressful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fathers need encouragement to spend more time with their children , some experts say in principle , germany 's new " elternzeit " scheme is also supposed to be a step in the right direction .
as in sweden , the option to take parental leave is open to both mothers and fathers . but in germany , less than 1 percent of fathers -lrb- around 4,500 men -rrb- actually take advantage of the option to stay home with their babies for a year , said political scientist peter doege , who conducts research on germans balancing family and work . he said with the new maternity leave proposals , the eu commission is showing that it is only thinking of women , as if they 're the only ones for who struggle to balance the demands of a family and a career .
he added that this does n't reflect today 's changing gender expectations . expectant fathers need to become much more involved in the process of both having and raising children , according to doege . " numerous studies have shown that fathers are more active in child-rearing when they feel that the child is just as much theirs - when they also experience pregnancy , " he said .
" those fathers who , for example , attend birth preparation classes , prove to be much more actively involved once the child is born . " longer maternity leave the solution ? the national association of german employers -lrb- bda -rrb- is against lengthening maternity leave .
renate hornung-draus , head of international social policy at the bda , instead calls for mothers and fathers to take equal advantage of parental leave . " you need to combine it such that neither parent ends up losing touch with the working world , but socially and culturally , we 're still far from that , " she said . employers are instead increasingly campaigning for better daycare options for working parents . " that would mean that parents do n't have to make such a radical ' all or nothing ' choice that is so harmful to job continuity and a true work-life balance , " hornung-draus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say creating better daycare options is the way to go hornung-draus has personally experienced both the german and belgian childcare systems .
in germany , it is still assumed that mothers carry the primary care responsibility , whereas in belgium , children are given adequate care and both parents are able to concentrate on their jobs . but maria kathmann from the german unions ' federaton -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said it 's employers who need to change their attitude the most . " if you look at the situation in eastern germany right now , only 57 percent of under-three-year-olds are in daycare , " she said . if you talk with works council representatives or employees , she added , time and again you hear that people have huge problems trying to combine work and family life . kathmann said hiring policies also need to be changed .

but brussels ' plans have met with criticism in germany . the eu commission would like to ensure that women are better able to combine work and family life .
to that end , self-employed women are to receive paid maternity leave for the first time . additionally , the commission 's proposals would increase the minimum period of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and recommend paying women 100 percent of their salary beyond the current minimum of paying at least equivalent to sick pay . women would have more flexibility to decide when to take the non-compulsory portion of their leave , either before or after childbirth , and would no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of leave before childbirth , as is presently the case in many member states . for most eu member countries , the proposals are more or less in keeping with the way governments already manage maternity leave .
but in germany , there was outrage when the commission unveiled its plans in early october . many women in germany do n't want to give up their jobs in order to raise children .
under german law , they 're entitled to three years of elternzeit , or parental leave , during which they ca n't be fired from their jobs . but the reality is often different .
employers frequently offer women severance pay if they voluntarily quit instead of opting for leave , and many women who do return to their jobs after maternity leave say they feel that they 're the victims of discrimination . the reality in germany is well known to anne seyferth of the friedrich ebert foundation . " compared to other european countries , germany is not exactly among the leaders when it comes to family politics , " she said .
" if we were , then we would n't have such a low birth rate , such a low rate of working mothers , nor such a relatively high number of children who are growing up in poor families . " reality of parental leave in germany sociological studies have shown the best insurance against child poverty is a mother who can work and earn money .
studies have also proven that there is a correlation between the number of children , and women 's employment status : the more mothers who receive adequate compensation for their work , the higher the birth rate .
this is also the basis for the eu commission 's plan to lengthen the period of paid maternity leave .
ultimately , the goal is to increase economic growth , prosperity and competitiveness in the whole european union . petra schott , who works for the commission in the department for employment , social affairs and equal opportunity , said the changes would be a step in the right direction . " women would have more time to recover after giving birth , " she said .
" they 'd have more time to get to know their child and adjust to life with a newborn . " she added that it could also make it easier for working women to find suitable childcare , which would make returning to work less stressful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fathers need encouragement to spend more time with their children , some experts say in principle , germany 's new " elternzeit " scheme is also supposed to be a step in the right direction .
as in sweden , the option to take parental leave is open to both mothers and fathers . but in germany , less than 1 percent of fathers -lrb- around 4,500 men -rrb- actually take advantage of the option to stay home with their babies for a year , said political scientist peter doege , who conducts research on germans balancing family and work . he said with the new maternity leave proposals , the eu commission is showing that it is only thinking of women , as if they 're the only ones for who struggle to balance the demands of a family and a career .
he added that this does n't reflect today 's changing gender expectations . expectant fathers need to become much more involved in the process of both having and raising children , according to doege . " numerous studies have shown that fathers are more active in child-rearing when they feel that the child is just as much theirs - when they also experience pregnancy , " he said .
" those fathers who , for example , attend birth preparation classes , prove to be much more actively involved once the child is born . " longer maternity leave the solution ? the national association of german employers -lrb- bda -rrb- is against lengthening maternity leave .
renate hornung-draus , head of international social policy at the bda , instead calls for mothers and fathers to take equal advantage of parental leave . " you need to combine it such that neither parent ends up losing touch with the working world , but socially and culturally , we 're still far from that , " she said . employers are instead increasingly campaigning for better daycare options for working parents . " that would mean that parents do n't have to make such a radical ' all or nothing ' choice that is so harmful to job continuity and a true work-life balance , " hornung-draus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say creating better daycare options is the way to go hornung-draus has personally experienced both the german and belgian childcare systems .
in germany , it is still assumed that mothers carry the primary care responsibility , whereas in belgium , children are given adequate care and both parents are able to concentrate on their jobs . but maria kathmann from the german unions ' federaton -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said it 's employers who need to change their attitude the most . " if you look at the situation in eastern germany right now , only 57 percent of under-three-year-olds are in daycare , " she said . if you talk with works council representatives or employees , she added , time and again you hear that people have huge problems trying to combine work and family life . kathmann said hiring policies also need to be changed .

the french eu presidency , however , said a military solution was not the answer . the crisis in the democratic republic of congo should be resolved by a " balanced political solution based on dialog , " according to the european union . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and french european affairs minister jean-pierre jouyet said a further dialog had to include the un , the eu , the african union as well as regional african organizations .

" we want them to reach a result very quickly , " jouyet said .
he said the eu was willing to increase its financial contribution to the un in order to help stabilize the region . industry 's responsibility to dr congo according to ferrero-waldner , monuc needed more power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masisi region contains important deposits of coltan " the mandate should be extended , for example , in terms of its control over the pillaging of natural resources , " she said .
monuc forces have come under criticism for failing to do enough to stop the violence . ferrero-waldner said she was " very pleased " with the latest diplomatic efforts by other african countries and individuals .
but now it was " high time to analyze the real causes for the crisis , " she said .
this included looting mines and oppressing minorities . several members of the european parliament said international companies should also be made to accept responsibility for controlling the exploitation of dr congo 's natural resources .
the country 's diamonds , zinc , gold and coltan are used in the communications and consumer electronics industries . nkunda 's ambitious plans rebel chief laurent nkunda told the german weekly die zeit he wanted to extend his control to include the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general nkunda aims to take over the whole of congo " under my leadership , the dr congo will be sitting in the un security council representing africa within five years time , " nkunda said in an interview published wednesday . he accused the current government of failure , saying it had sold out the country to the chinese and cooperated with " criminals . " nkunda has promised to take action against the ever-present corruption in dr congo and make it an internationally recognized country . the un mission in dr congo said wednesday that nkunda 's rebels had started withdrawing from conflict zones around two towns in the east of the country .
more than 250,000 people have been displaced since fighting erupted between nkunda 's rebels and the military in nord-kivu province in late august . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but brussels ' plans have met with criticism in germany . the eu commission would like to ensure that women are better able to combine work and family life .
to that end , self-employed women are to receive paid maternity leave for the first time . additionally , the commission 's proposals would increase the minimum period of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and recommend paying women 100 percent of their salary beyond the current minimum of paying at least equivalent to sick pay . women would have more flexibility to decide when to take the non-compulsory portion of their leave , either before or after childbirth , and would no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of leave before childbirth , as is presently the case in many member states . for most eu member countries , the proposals are more or less in keeping with the way governments already manage maternity leave .
but in germany , there was outrage when the commission unveiled its plans in early october . many women in germany do n't want to give up their jobs in order to raise children .
under german law , they 're entitled to three years of elternzeit , or parental leave , during which they ca n't be fired from their jobs . but the reality is often different .
employers frequently offer women severance pay if they voluntarily quit instead of opting for leave , and many women who do return to their jobs after maternity leave say they feel that they 're the victims of discrimination . the reality in germany is well known to anne seyferth of the friedrich ebert foundation . " compared to other european countries , germany is not exactly among the leaders when it comes to family politics , " she said .
" if we were , then we would n't have such a low birth rate , such a low rate of working mothers , nor such a relatively high number of children who are growing up in poor families . " reality of parental leave in germany sociological studies have shown the best insurance against child poverty is a mother who can work and earn money .
studies have also proven that there is a correlation between the number of children , and women 's employment status : the more mothers who receive adequate compensation for their work , the higher the birth rate .
this is also the basis for the eu commission 's plan to lengthen the period of paid maternity leave .
ultimately , the goal is to increase economic growth , prosperity and competitiveness in the whole european union . petra schott , who works for the commission in the department for employment , social affairs and equal opportunity , said the changes would be a step in the right direction . " women would have more time to recover after giving birth , " she said .
" they 'd have more time to get to know their child and adjust to life with a newborn . " she added that it could also make it easier for working women to find suitable childcare , which would make returning to work less stressful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fathers need encouragement to spend more time with their children , some experts say in principle , germany 's new " elternzeit " scheme is also supposed to be a step in the right direction .
as in sweden , the option to take parental leave is open to both mothers and fathers . but in germany , less than 1 percent of fathers -lrb- around 4,500 men -rrb- actually take advantage of the option to stay home with their babies for a year , said political scientist peter doege , who conducts research on germans balancing family and work . he said with the new maternity leave proposals , the eu commission is showing that it is only thinking of women , as if they 're the only ones for who struggle to balance the demands of a family and a career .
he added that this does n't reflect today 's changing gender expectations . expectant fathers need to become much more involved in the process of both having and raising children , according to doege . " numerous studies have shown that fathers are more active in child-rearing when they feel that the child is just as much theirs - when they also experience pregnancy , " he said .
" those fathers who , for example , attend birth preparation classes , prove to be much more actively involved once the child is born . " longer maternity leave the solution ? the national association of german employers -lrb- bda -rrb- is against lengthening maternity leave .
renate hornung-draus , head of international social policy at the bda , instead calls for mothers and fathers to take equal advantage of parental leave . " you need to combine it such that neither parent ends up losing touch with the working world , but socially and culturally , we 're still far from that , " she said . employers are instead increasingly campaigning for better daycare options for working parents . " that would mean that parents do n't have to make such a radical ' all or nothing ' choice that is so harmful to job continuity and a true work-life balance , " hornung-draus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say creating better daycare options is the way to go hornung-draus has personally experienced both the german and belgian childcare systems .
in germany , it is still assumed that mothers carry the primary care responsibility , whereas in belgium , children are given adequate care and both parents are able to concentrate on their jobs . but maria kathmann from the german unions ' federaton -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said it 's employers who need to change their attitude the most . " if you look at the situation in eastern germany right now , only 57 percent of under-three-year-olds are in daycare , " she said . if you talk with works council representatives or employees , she added , time and again you hear that people have huge problems trying to combine work and family life . kathmann said hiring policies also need to be changed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.11.2008 german minister : eu plans massive economic aid package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the package might be too small the european union is planning to unveil an economic stimulus package worth 130 billion euros , german economics minister michael glos said wednesday .
all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .
solarworld bids for opel factories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as opel awaits its fate , solar world make an audacious bid verheugen 's comments came as german solar energy company solarworld announced it had prepared an offer for the four german auto factories owned by opel , worth one billion euros , to create the " first green european car company . "
whatever measures are decided on , rescue action for the auto industry in europe can not come fast enough .
car sales across europe were down 14.5 per cent in october on the same month in 2007 .
the social and financial cost of a bankrupt car industry would be dramatic .
the european car industry provides income for some 12 million families and last year generated a combined turnover of 551 billion euros -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- , or about 5 percent of the continent 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .

but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .

all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .
solarworld bids for opel factories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as opel awaits its fate , solar world make an audacious bid verheugen 's comments came as german solar energy company solarworld announced it had prepared an offer for the four german auto factories owned by opel , worth one billion euros , to create the " first green european car company . "
whatever measures are decided on , rescue action for the auto industry in europe can not come fast enough .
car sales across europe were down 14.5 per cent in october on the same month in 2007 .
the social and financial cost of a bankrupt car industry would be dramatic .

the first round of talks last month ended with moscow and tbilisi accusing each other of walking out without the two sides having sat in the same room .
" today , we have taken a big step forward , " said morel , adding that the talks had entered a " fully operational phase . "
the sides also set out priorities for work to go on before the third round , now set for dec .

the georgian official said he wanted to see the observer mandate of the eu and the oece to be extended to include breakaway regions not currently part of the mandate to help aid the planned incident prevention mechanisms and the ceasefire deal .
in addition , projects were under way to provide thousands of shelters for the most desperate refugees before winter fully set in and russia and georgia agreed on the need to facilitate a return of the displaced peoples to their homes .
" our concern is the people themselves , " verbeke said , adding that field visits by the various moderators would continue .
contentious issues to be tackled at a later date the parties said they had agreed to suspend talks on thorny issues likely to derail the meetings and to focus on the areas where there was agreement .

" this trial will continue as a closed trial , " said judge yevgeny zubov , who is presiding over the case .
" this is considering the security of the participants in the trial , that of their relatives and their loved ones . "
zubov 's decision came after his ruling on the first day of the trial on monday , when he said the proceedings would be open but that he had the right to close them .
politkovskaya , an award-winning reporter for the novaya gazeta , was a fierce critic of the kremlin 's actions during two wars in chechnya in the early 1990s .
the slain journalist 's family and colleagues have lashed out at the decision .
" i am very disappointed , " a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family , karinna moskalenko , told reporters .
" i think this trial should have been open , not only because all trials should be , but because she was a public figure and the public should know the circumstances of her killing . "
politkovskaya 's son , ilya , said : " of course we do not like the closed trial ...
there is nothing wrong with having journalists there . "

" our concern is the people themselves , " verbeke said , adding that field visits by the various moderators would continue .
contentious issues to be tackled at a later date the parties said they had agreed to suspend talks on thorny issues likely to derail the meetings and to focus on the areas where there was agreement .

" this trial will continue as a closed trial , " said judge yevgeny zubov , who is presiding over the case .
" this is considering the security of the participants in the trial , that of their relatives and their loved ones . "
zubov 's decision came after his ruling on the first day of the trial on monday , when he said the proceedings would be open but that he had the right to close them .
politkovskaya , an award-winning reporter for the novaya gazeta , was a fierce critic of the kremlin 's actions during two wars in chechnya in the early 1990s .
the slain journalist 's family and colleagues have lashed out at the decision .
" i am very disappointed , " a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family , karinna moskalenko , told reporters .
" i think this trial should have been open , not only because all trials should be , but because she was a public figure and the public should know the circumstances of her killing . "
politkovskaya 's son , ilya , said : " of course we do not like the closed trial ...
there is nothing wrong with having journalists there . "

" this trial will continue as a closed trial , " said judge yevgeny zubov , who is presiding over the case .
" this is considering the security of the participants in the trial , that of their relatives and their loved ones . "
zubov 's decision came after his ruling on the first day of the trial on monday , when he said the proceedings would be open but that he had the right to close them .
politkovskaya , an award-winning reporter for the novaya gazeta , was a fierce critic of the kremlin 's actions during two wars in chechnya in the early 1990s .
the slain journalist 's family and colleagues have lashed out at the decision .
" i am very disappointed , " a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family , karinna moskalenko , told reporters .
" i think this trial should have been open , not only because all trials should be , but because she was a public figure and the public should know the circumstances of her killing . "
politkovskaya 's son , ilya , said : " of course we do not like the closed trial ...
there is nothing wrong with having journalists there . "
the slain journalist 's family members have sharply criticized the investigation , complaining the defendants on trial are only loosely connected to the contract killing and of the investigation 's secrecy and painstaking progress more than two years after her murder . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we want them to reach a result very quickly , " jouyet said .

monuc forces have come under criticism for failing to do enough to stop the violence . ferrero-waldner said she was " very pleased " with the latest diplomatic efforts by other african countries and individuals .
but now it was " high time to analyze the real causes for the crisis , " she said .
this included looting mines and oppressing minorities . several members of the european parliament said international companies should also be made to accept responsibility for controlling the exploitation of dr congo 's natural resources .
the country 's diamonds , zinc , gold and coltan are used in the communications and consumer electronics industries . nkunda 's ambitious plans rebel chief laurent nkunda told the german weekly die zeit he wanted to extend his control to include the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general nkunda aims to take over the whole of congo " under my leadership , the dr congo will be sitting in the un security council representing africa within five years time , " nkunda said in an interview published wednesday . he accused the current government of failure , saying it had sold out the country to the chinese and cooperated with " criminals . " nkunda has promised to take action against the ever-present corruption in dr congo and make it an internationally recognized country . the un mission in dr congo said wednesday that nkunda 's rebels had started withdrawing from conflict zones around two towns in the east of the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.11.2008 german minister : eu plans massive economic aid package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the package might be too small the european union is planning to unveil an economic stimulus package worth 130 billion euros , german economics minister michael glos said wednesday .
all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .
solarworld bids for opel factories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as opel awaits its fate , solar world make an audacious bid verheugen 's comments came as german solar energy company solarworld announced it had prepared an offer for the four german auto factories owned by opel , worth one billion euros , to create the " first green european car company . "
whatever measures are decided on , rescue action for the auto industry in europe can not come fast enough .
car sales across europe were down 14.5 per cent in october on the same month in 2007 .
the social and financial cost of a bankrupt car industry would be dramatic .
the european car industry provides income for some 12 million families and last year generated a combined turnover of 551 billion euros -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- , or about 5 percent of the continent 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the french eu presidency , however , said a military solution was not the answer . the crisis in the democratic republic of congo should be resolved by a " balanced political solution based on dialog , " according to the european union . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and french european affairs minister jean-pierre jouyet said a further dialog had to include the un , the eu , the african union as well as regional african organizations .

" we want them to reach a result very quickly , " jouyet said .
he said the eu was willing to increase its financial contribution to the un in order to help stabilize the region . industry 's responsibility to dr congo according to ferrero-waldner , monuc needed more power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masisi region contains important deposits of coltan " the mandate should be extended , for example , in terms of its control over the pillaging of natural resources , " she said .
monuc forces have come under criticism for failing to do enough to stop the violence . ferrero-waldner said she was " very pleased " with the latest diplomatic efforts by other african countries and individuals .
but now it was " high time to analyze the real causes for the crisis , " she said .
this included looting mines and oppressing minorities . several members of the european parliament said international companies should also be made to accept responsibility for controlling the exploitation of dr congo 's natural resources .
the country 's diamonds , zinc , gold and coltan are used in the communications and consumer electronics industries . nkunda 's ambitious plans rebel chief laurent nkunda told the german weekly die zeit he wanted to extend his control to include the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general nkunda aims to take over the whole of congo " under my leadership , the dr congo will be sitting in the un security council representing africa within five years time , " nkunda said in an interview published wednesday . he accused the current government of failure , saying it had sold out the country to the chinese and cooperated with " criminals . " nkunda has promised to take action against the ever-present corruption in dr congo and make it an internationally recognized country . the un mission in dr congo said wednesday that nkunda 's rebels had started withdrawing from conflict zones around two towns in the east of the country .

all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .
solarworld bids for opel factories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as opel awaits its fate , solar world make an audacious bid verheugen 's comments came as german solar energy company solarworld announced it had prepared an offer for the four german auto factories owned by opel , worth one billion euros , to create the " first green european car company .

all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .

19 and agreed to meet again for another round of negotiations next month , the eu representative to the discussions said . " we had constructive meetings of the two working groups , " said pierre morel , the eu 's special representative to georgia .
as planned , the two groups , with eight delegations in total , met on security and refugee issues for about three hours each .
the first round of talks last month ended with moscow and tbilisi accusing each other of walking out without the two sides having sat in the same room .
" today , we have taken a big step forward , " said morel , adding that the talks had entered a " fully operational phase . "
the sides also set out priorities for work to go on before the third round , now set for dec .
17 and 18 in geneva .
it remained to be decided if next month 's talks would include a plenary session .
giorgi bokeria , a georgian deputy minister of foreign affairs , said later that his country supports a plenary session that does not include representatives of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" the conflict is between russia and georgia , " he told reporters .
willingness to address ceasefire violations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian troops reported south ossetian incursions recent claims of ceasefire violations were discussed during the day 's meetings , and the moderators said incident prevention and management mechanisms were going to be drawn up with the hopes of getting a system in place to ensure stability .
" that fact means that there is a mandate to do something , " said the un 's representative john verbeke , noting that all parties felt " the ceasefire should be respected . "
the georgian official said he wanted to see the observer mandate of the eu and the oece to be extended to include breakaway regions not currently part of the mandate to help aid the planned incident prevention mechanisms and the ceasefire deal .
in addition , projects were under way to provide thousands of shelters for the most desperate refugees before winter fully set in and russia and georgia agreed on the need to facilitate a return of the displaced peoples to their homes .
" our concern is the people themselves , " verbeke said , adding that field visits by the various moderators would continue .
contentious issues to be tackled at a later date the parties said they had agreed to suspend talks on thorny issues likely to derail the meetings and to focus on the areas where there was agreement .
bildunterschrift : the caucasus region is still a highly disputed area and there is much to be resolved the delegations from russia , georgia and the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia had arrived in the morning at the united nations building in geneva for the second round of talks since they went to war in the summer .
also at the meetings , in addition to the eu and un officials , were representatives from the united states and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
" it will be eight individuals in groups working together , " said maxim grinjia , a deputy to the foreign minister of the breakaway region of abkhazia , before going into the working groups .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.11.2008 german minister : eu plans massive economic aid package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the package might be too small the european union is planning to unveil an economic stimulus package worth 130 billion euros , german economics minister michael glos said wednesday .
all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .
solarworld bids for opel factories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as opel awaits its fate , solar world make an audacious bid verheugen 's comments came as german solar energy company solarworld announced it had prepared an offer for the four german auto factories owned by opel , worth one billion euros , to create the " first green european car company . "
whatever measures are decided on , rescue action for the auto industry in europe can not come fast enough .
car sales across europe were down 14.5 per cent in october on the same month in 2007 .
the social and financial cost of a bankrupt car industry would be dramatic .
the european car industry provides income for some 12 million families and last year generated a combined turnover of 551 billion euros -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- , or about 5 percent of the continent 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.11.2008 german minister : eu plans massive economic aid package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the package might be too small the european union is planning to unveil an economic stimulus package worth 130 billion euros , german economics minister michael glos said wednesday .
all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .

all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.11.2008 german minister : eu plans massive economic aid package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the package might be too small the european union is planning to unveil an economic stimulus package worth 130 billion euros , german economics minister michael glos said wednesday .
all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .
solarworld bids for opel factories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as opel awaits its fate , solar world make an audacious bid verheugen 's comments came as german solar energy company solarworld announced it had prepared an offer for the four german auto factories owned by opel , worth one billion euros , to create the " first green european car company . "
whatever measures are decided on , rescue action for the auto industry in europe can not come fast enough .
car sales across europe were down 14.5 per cent in october on the same month in 2007 .
the social and financial cost of a bankrupt car industry would be dramatic .
the european car industry provides income for some 12 million families and last year generated a combined turnover of 551 billion euros -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- , or about 5 percent of the continent 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.11.2008 german minister : eu plans massive economic aid package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the package might be too small the european union is planning to unveil an economic stimulus package worth 130 billion euros , german economics minister michael glos said wednesday .
all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .
solarworld bids for opel factories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as opel awaits its fate , solar world make an audacious bid verheugen 's comments came as german solar energy company solarworld announced it had prepared an offer for the four german auto factories owned by opel , worth one billion euros , to create the " first green european car company . "
whatever measures are decided on , rescue action for the auto industry in europe can not come fast enough .
car sales across europe were down 14.5 per cent in october on the same month in 2007 .
the social and financial cost of a bankrupt car industry would be dramatic .
the european car industry provides income for some 12 million families and last year generated a combined turnover of 551 billion euros -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- , or about 5 percent of the continent 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the georgian official said he wanted to see the observer mandate of the eu and the oece to be extended to include breakaway regions not currently part of the mandate to help aid the planned incident prevention mechanisms and the ceasefire deal .
in addition , projects were under way to provide thousands of shelters for the most desperate refugees before winter fully set in and russia and georgia agreed on the need to facilitate a return of the displaced peoples to their homes .
" our concern is the people themselves , " verbeke said , adding that field visits by the various moderators would continue .
contentious issues to be tackled at a later date the parties said they had agreed to suspend talks on thorny issues likely to derail the meetings and to focus on the areas where there was agreement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.11.2008 german minister : eu plans massive economic aid package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the package might be too small the european union is planning to unveil an economic stimulus package worth 130 billion euros , german economics minister michael glos said wednesday .
all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .
solarworld bids for opel factories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as opel awaits its fate , solar world make an audacious bid verheugen 's comments came as german solar energy company solarworld announced it had prepared an offer for the four german auto factories owned by opel , worth one billion euros , to create the " first green european car company . "
whatever measures are decided on , rescue action for the auto industry in europe can not come fast enough .
car sales across europe were down 14.5 per cent in october on the same month in 2007 .
the social and financial cost of a bankrupt car industry would be dramatic .
the european car industry provides income for some 12 million families and last year generated a combined turnover of 551 billion euros -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- , or about 5 percent of the continent 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dwindling demand and problems with liquidity have some of the biggest names in the business eyeing a bleak future . there 's a saying in germany that when daimler coughs , the state of baden-wuerttemberg catches pneumonia .
things are not yet quite as bad as that in the home of mercedes-benz , or in germany in general .
but strong medicine is needed to get germany 's ailing car industry back on its feet amid a slump in profits and sales .
the first dose was requested by opel , once the nation 's biggest carmaker , which has been brought to its knees by the massive losses suffered by its us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- .
opel has asked the german government for 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
chancellor angela merkel has promised a decision by the end of december , but insists that any funding would have to stay in germany and not be transferred back to gm .
opel , which employees 27,500 workers at four plants across the country , has already reduced production and sent workers home because not enough people are buying its cars .
similarly , daimler has extended the winter holiday for production staff .
it recently announced that sales in october had slumped 18.1 percent over the year , to 93,900 vehicles .
slump in demand sets off warning alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of new cars are all dressed up with nowhere to go the global financial crisis has badly hit demand for new cars , triggering alarm in germany , where an estimated one in six jobs is related to the sector , either directly or indirectly .
in the stuttgart region of baden-wuerttemberg , where daimler has its headquarters , 300,000 people depend on the car industry for a living .
porsche and auto supplier bosch also have factories there .
some 100,000 jobs in the industry could disappear by the end of 2009 unless concrete action is taken to shore up the sector , says ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a leading automotive expert at the university of duisburg-essen .
willi diez , a professor at geislingen university 's automobile economics department , believes car manufacturers could slash 25,000 jobs by the middle of next year , with the same number disappearing from companies that supply auto parts .
workers at faltering opel have much to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel plant in eisenach is currently on life-support car workers are concerned about their future in the 60,000-population city of ruesselsheim , south-west of frankfurt , where opel is by far the biggest employer .
" it has all happened so quickly .
and if our parent company collapses , then it is all over for us , " said one of the 18,300 workers as he clocked off at the end of shift on monday .
" without opel , we might as well as pack up , " said adnan dayankac , chairman of a local association that includes many foreigners who work for the carmaker .
" the whole city and the surrounding region depend on opel . "
the mood is not much better in the eastern german city of eisenach , where 1,900 workers are employed at a plant that assembles the popular compact model corsa .
production was halted in eisenach for three weeks in october .
many workers are worried that soon there might not be any cars at all coming off the production lines .
" we are afraid general motors will pull us down with it into the abyss , " said harald lieske , who has been with opel since it began production in the east 18 years ago and now heads its workers ' council .
glos optimistic of opel survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those are alarm bells you 're hearing , herr glos german economics minister michael glos said he was optimistic that opel would weather the crisis .
he said opel would have been better off had it remained a german-owned company and not become a subsidiary of gm .
glos singled out the opel 's successful array of models , including the new family car insignia .
the insignia was just voted 2009 car of the year by an international panel of auto journalists .
whether this alone will help boost sales remains to be seen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.11.2008 german minister : eu plans massive economic aid package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the package might be too small the european union is planning to unveil an economic stimulus package worth 130 billion euros , german economics minister michael glos said wednesday .
all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .
solarworld bids for opel factories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as opel awaits its fate , solar world make an audacious bid verheugen 's comments came as german solar energy company solarworld announced it had prepared an offer for the four german auto factories owned by opel , worth one billion euros , to create the " first green european car company . "
whatever measures are decided on , rescue action for the auto industry in europe can not come fast enough .
car sales across europe were down 14.5 per cent in october on the same month in 2007 .
the social and financial cost of a bankrupt car industry would be dramatic .
the european car industry provides income for some 12 million families and last year generated a combined turnover of 551 billion euros -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- , or about 5 percent of the continent 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dwindling demand and problems with liquidity have some of the biggest names in the business eyeing a bleak future . there 's a saying in germany that when daimler coughs , the state of baden-wuerttemberg catches pneumonia .
things are not yet quite as bad as that in the home of mercedes-benz , or in germany in general .
but strong medicine is needed to get germany 's ailing car industry back on its feet amid a slump in profits and sales .
the first dose was requested by opel , once the nation 's biggest carmaker , which has been brought to its knees by the massive losses suffered by its us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- .
opel has asked the german government for 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
chancellor angela merkel has promised a decision by the end of december , but insists that any funding would have to stay in germany and not be transferred back to gm .
opel , which employees 27,500 workers at four plants across the country , has already reduced production and sent workers home because not enough people are buying its cars .
similarly , daimler has extended the winter holiday for production staff .
it recently announced that sales in october had slumped 18.1 percent over the year , to 93,900 vehicles .
slump in demand sets off warning alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of new cars are all dressed up with nowhere to go the global financial crisis has badly hit demand for new cars , triggering alarm in germany , where an estimated one in six jobs is related to the sector , either directly or indirectly .
in the stuttgart region of baden-wuerttemberg , where daimler has its headquarters , 300,000 people depend on the car industry for a living .
porsche and auto supplier bosch also have factories there .
some 100,000 jobs in the industry could disappear by the end of 2009 unless concrete action is taken to shore up the sector , says ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a leading automotive expert at the university of duisburg-essen .
willi diez , a professor at geislingen university 's automobile economics department , believes car manufacturers could slash 25,000 jobs by the middle of next year , with the same number disappearing from companies that supply auto parts .
workers at faltering opel have much to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel plant in eisenach is currently on life-support car workers are concerned about their future in the 60,000-population city of ruesselsheim , south-west of frankfurt , where opel is by far the biggest employer .
" it has all happened so quickly .
and if our parent company collapses , then it is all over for us , " said one of the 18,300 workers as he clocked off at the end of shift on monday .
" without opel , we might as well as pack up , " said adnan dayankac , chairman of a local association that includes many foreigners who work for the carmaker .
" the whole city and the surrounding region depend on opel . "
the mood is not much better in the eastern german city of eisenach , where 1,900 workers are employed at a plant that assembles the popular compact model corsa .
production was halted in eisenach for three weeks in october .
many workers are worried that soon there might not be any cars at all coming off the production lines .
" we are afraid general motors will pull us down with it into the abyss , " said harald lieske , who has been with opel since it began production in the east 18 years ago and now heads its workers ' council .
glos optimistic of opel survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those are alarm bells you 're hearing , herr glos german economics minister michael glos said he was optimistic that opel would weather the crisis .
he said opel would have been better off had it remained a german-owned company and not become a subsidiary of gm .
glos singled out the opel 's successful array of models , including the new family car insignia .
the insignia was just voted 2009 car of the year by an international panel of auto journalists .
whether this alone will help boost sales remains to be seen .

dwindling demand and problems with liquidity have some of the biggest names in the business eyeing a bleak future . there 's a saying in germany that when daimler coughs , the state of baden-wuerttemberg catches pneumonia .
things are not yet quite as bad as that in the home of mercedes-benz , or in germany in general .
but strong medicine is needed to get germany 's ailing car industry back on its feet amid a slump in profits and sales .
the first dose was requested by opel , once the nation 's biggest carmaker , which has been brought to its knees by the massive losses suffered by its us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- .
opel has asked the german government for 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
chancellor angela merkel has promised a decision by the end of december , but insists that any funding would have to stay in germany and not be transferred back to gm .
opel , which employees 27,500 workers at four plants across the country , has already reduced production and sent workers home because not enough people are buying its cars .
similarly , daimler has extended the winter holiday for production staff .
it recently announced that sales in october had slumped 18.1 percent over the year , to 93,900 vehicles .
slump in demand sets off warning alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of new cars are all dressed up with nowhere to go the global financial crisis has badly hit demand for new cars , triggering alarm in germany , where an estimated one in six jobs is related to the sector , either directly or indirectly .
in the stuttgart region of baden-wuerttemberg , where daimler has its headquarters , 300,000 people depend on the car industry for a living .
porsche and auto supplier bosch also have factories there .
some 100,000 jobs in the industry could disappear by the end of 2009 unless concrete action is taken to shore up the sector , says ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a leading automotive expert at the university of duisburg-essen .
willi diez , a professor at geislingen university 's automobile economics department , believes car manufacturers could slash 25,000 jobs by the middle of next year , with the same number disappearing from companies that supply auto parts .
workers at faltering opel have much to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel plant in eisenach is currently on life-support car workers are concerned about their future in the 60,000-population city of ruesselsheim , south-west of frankfurt , where opel is by far the biggest employer .
" it has all happened so quickly .
and if our parent company collapses , then it is all over for us , " said one of the 18,300 workers as he clocked off at the end of shift on monday .
" without opel , we might as well as pack up , " said adnan dayankac , chairman of a local association that includes many foreigners who work for the carmaker .
" the whole city and the surrounding region depend on opel . "
the mood is not much better in the eastern german city of eisenach , where 1,900 workers are employed at a plant that assembles the popular compact model corsa .
production was halted in eisenach for three weeks in october .
many workers are worried that soon there might not be any cars at all coming off the production lines .
" we are afraid general motors will pull us down with it into the abyss , " said harald lieske , who has been with opel since it began production in the east 18 years ago and now heads its workers ' council .
glos optimistic of opel survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those are alarm bells you 're hearing , herr glos german economics minister michael glos said he was optimistic that opel would weather the crisis .
he said opel would have been better off had it remained a german-owned company and not become a subsidiary of gm .
glos singled out the opel 's successful array of models , including the new family car insignia .
the insignia was just voted 2009 car of the year by an international panel of auto journalists .
whether this alone will help boost sales remains to be seen .
" it will take until 2010 before the market gets back to normal , " dudenhoeffer said .
" by then , those manufacturers who present new models with fuel-saving technology will be in the driving seat . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this trial will continue as a closed trial , " said judge yevgeny zubov , who is presiding over the case .
" this is considering the security of the participants in the trial , that of their relatives and their loved ones . "
zubov 's decision came after his ruling on the first day of the trial on monday , when he said the proceedings would be open but that he had the right to close them .
politkovskaya , an award-winning reporter for the novaya gazeta , was a fierce critic of the kremlin 's actions during two wars in chechnya in the early 1990s .
the slain journalist 's family and colleagues have lashed out at the decision .
" i am very disappointed , " a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family , karinna moskalenko , told reporters .
" i think this trial should have been open , not only because all trials should be , but because she was a public figure and the public should know the circumstances of her killing . "
politkovskaya 's son , ilya , said : " of course we do not like the closed trial ...
there is nothing wrong with having journalists there . "
the slain journalist 's family members have sharply criticized the investigation , complaining the defendants on trial are only loosely connected to the contract killing and of the investigation 's secrecy and painstaking progress more than two years after her murder . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this trial will continue as a closed trial , " said judge yevgeny zubov , who is presiding over the case .

politkovskaya , an award-winning reporter for the novaya gazeta , was a fierce critic of the kremlin 's actions during two wars in chechnya in the early 1990s .

" i am very disappointed , " a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family , karinna moskalenko , told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 19.11.2008 germany criticizes eu changes to maternity leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say the proposals focus on women the eu commission would like to make it easier for new mothers to return to the workplace by providing longer and better paid maternity leave .
but brussels ' plans have met with criticism in germany . the eu commission would like to ensure that women are better able to combine work and family life .
to that end , self-employed women are to receive paid maternity leave for the first time . additionally , the commission 's proposals would increase the minimum period of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and recommend paying women 100 percent of their salary beyond the current minimum of paying at least equivalent to sick pay . women would have more flexibility to decide when to take the non-compulsory portion of their leave , either before or after childbirth , and would no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of leave before childbirth , as is presently the case in many member states . for most eu member countries , the proposals are more or less in keeping with the way governments already manage maternity leave .
but in germany , there was outrage when the commission unveiled its plans in early october . many women in germany do n't want to give up their jobs in order to raise children .
under german law , they 're entitled to three years of elternzeit , or parental leave , during which they ca n't be fired from their jobs . but the reality is often different .
employers frequently offer women severance pay if they voluntarily quit instead of opting for leave , and many women who do return to their jobs after maternity leave say they feel that they 're the victims of discrimination . the reality in germany is well known to anne seyferth of the friedrich ebert foundation . " compared to other european countries , germany is not exactly among the leaders when it comes to family politics , " she said .
" if we were , then we would n't have such a low birth rate , such a low rate of working mothers , nor such a relatively high number of children who are growing up in poor families . " reality of parental leave in germany sociological studies have shown the best insurance against child poverty is a mother who can work and earn money .
studies have also proven that there is a correlation between the number of children , and women 's employment status : the more mothers who receive adequate compensation for their work , the higher the birth rate .
this is also the basis for the eu commission 's plan to lengthen the period of paid maternity leave .
ultimately , the goal is to increase economic growth , prosperity and competitiveness in the whole european union . petra schott , who works for the commission in the department for employment , social affairs and equal opportunity , said the changes would be a step in the right direction . " women would have more time to recover after giving birth , " she said .
" they 'd have more time to get to know their child and adjust to life with a newborn . " she added that it could also make it easier for working women to find suitable childcare , which would make returning to work less stressful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fathers need encouragement to spend more time with their children , some experts say in principle , germany 's new " elternzeit " scheme is also supposed to be a step in the right direction .
as in sweden , the option to take parental leave is open to both mothers and fathers . but in germany , less than 1 percent of fathers -lrb- around 4,500 men -rrb- actually take advantage of the option to stay home with their babies for a year , said political scientist peter doege , who conducts research on germans balancing family and work . he said with the new maternity leave proposals , the eu commission is showing that it is only thinking of women , as if they 're the only ones for who struggle to balance the demands of a family and a career .
he added that this does n't reflect today 's changing gender expectations . expectant fathers need to become much more involved in the process of both having and raising children , according to doege . " numerous studies have shown that fathers are more active in child-rearing when they feel that the child is just as much theirs - when they also experience pregnancy , " he said .
" those fathers who , for example , attend birth preparation classes , prove to be much more actively involved once the child is born . " longer maternity leave the solution ? the national association of german employers -lrb- bda -rrb- is against lengthening maternity leave .
renate hornung-draus , head of international social policy at the bda , instead calls for mothers and fathers to take equal advantage of parental leave . " you need to combine it such that neither parent ends up losing touch with the working world , but socially and culturally , we 're still far from that , " she said . employers are instead increasingly campaigning for better daycare options for working parents . " that would mean that parents do n't have to make such a radical ' all or nothing ' choice that is so harmful to job continuity and a true work-life balance , " hornung-draus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say creating better daycare options is the way to go hornung-draus has personally experienced both the german and belgian childcare systems .
in germany , it is still assumed that mothers carry the primary care responsibility , whereas in belgium , children are given adequate care and both parents are able to concentrate on their jobs . but maria kathmann from the german unions ' federaton -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said it 's employers who need to change their attitude the most . " if you look at the situation in eastern germany right now , only 57 percent of under-three-year-olds are in daycare , " she said . if you talk with works council representatives or employees , she added , time and again you hear that people have huge problems trying to combine work and family life . kathmann said hiring policies also need to be changed .

but brussels ' plans have met with criticism in germany . the eu commission would like to ensure that women are better able to combine work and family life .
to that end , self-employed women are to receive paid maternity leave for the first time . additionally , the commission 's proposals would increase the minimum period of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and recommend paying women 100 percent of their salary beyond the current minimum of paying at least equivalent to sick pay . women would have more flexibility to decide when to take the non-compulsory portion of their leave , either before or after childbirth , and would no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of leave before childbirth , as is presently the case in many member states . for most eu member countries , the proposals are more or less in keeping with the way governments already manage maternity leave .
but in germany , there was outrage when the commission unveiled its plans in early october . many women in germany do n't want to give up their jobs in order to raise children .
under german law , they 're entitled to three years of elternzeit , or parental leave , during which they ca n't be fired from their jobs . but the reality is often different .
employers frequently offer women severance pay if they voluntarily quit instead of opting for leave , and many women who do return to their jobs after maternity leave say they feel that they 're the victims of discrimination . the reality in germany is well known to anne seyferth of the friedrich ebert foundation . " compared to other european countries , germany is not exactly among the leaders when it comes to family politics , " she said .
" if we were , then we would n't have such a low birth rate , such a low rate of working mothers , nor such a relatively high number of children who are growing up in poor families . " reality of parental leave in germany sociological studies have shown the best insurance against child poverty is a mother who can work and earn money .
studies have also proven that there is a correlation between the number of children , and women 's employment status : the more mothers who receive adequate compensation for their work , the higher the birth rate .
this is also the basis for the eu commission 's plan to lengthen the period of paid maternity leave .
ultimately , the goal is to increase economic growth , prosperity and competitiveness in the whole european union . petra schott , who works for the commission in the department for employment , social affairs and equal opportunity , said the changes would be a step in the right direction . " women would have more time to recover after giving birth , " she said .
" they 'd have more time to get to know their child and adjust to life with a newborn . " she added that it could also make it easier for working women to find suitable childcare , which would make returning to work less stressful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fathers need encouragement to spend more time with their children , some experts say in principle , germany 's new " elternzeit " scheme is also supposed to be a step in the right direction .
as in sweden , the option to take parental leave is open to both mothers and fathers . but in germany , less than 1 percent of fathers -lrb- around 4,500 men -rrb- actually take advantage of the option to stay home with their babies for a year , said political scientist peter doege , who conducts research on germans balancing family and work . he said with the new maternity leave proposals , the eu commission is showing that it is only thinking of women , as if they 're the only ones for who struggle to balance the demands of a family and a career .
he added that this does n't reflect today 's changing gender expectations . expectant fathers need to become much more involved in the process of both having and raising children , according to doege . " numerous studies have shown that fathers are more active in child-rearing when they feel that the child is just as much theirs - when they also experience pregnancy , " he said .
" those fathers who , for example , attend birth preparation classes , prove to be much more actively involved once the child is born . " longer maternity leave the solution ? the national association of german employers -lrb- bda -rrb- is against lengthening maternity leave .
renate hornung-draus , head of international social policy at the bda , instead calls for mothers and fathers to take equal advantage of parental leave . " you need to combine it such that neither parent ends up losing touch with the working world , but socially and culturally , we 're still far from that , " she said . employers are instead increasingly campaigning for better daycare options for working parents . " that would mean that parents do n't have to make such a radical ' all or nothing ' choice that is so harmful to job continuity and a true work-life balance , " hornung-draus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say creating better daycare options is the way to go hornung-draus has personally experienced both the german and belgian childcare systems .
in germany , it is still assumed that mothers carry the primary care responsibility , whereas in belgium , children are given adequate care and both parents are able to concentrate on their jobs . but maria kathmann from the german unions ' federaton -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said it 's employers who need to change their attitude the most . " if you look at the situation in eastern germany right now , only 57 percent of under-three-year-olds are in daycare , " she said . if you talk with works council representatives or employees , she added , time and again you hear that people have huge problems trying to combine work and family life . kathmann said hiring policies also need to be changed . " it has a lot to do with the current employment culture of presence and showing your face , and with the expectation from employers to first select staff members who have nothing else going on in the background .

with a limited mandate , their ships can not keep armed bandits from seizing merchant vessels and taking hostages . pirates off the coast of somalia captured another ship on wednesday , nov .
19 .
it is the third vessel since the spectacular hijacking of the saudi supertanker " sirius star " last weekend . although nato , european and us vessels are stationed in the region , they are helpless in effectively battling the increasing problem of piracy - though single operations are sometimes successful . the german navy , for example , said tuesday one of its frigates had foiled attacks on two ships in the gulf of aden , using a helicopter to chase off pirates who fled in their speedboats . larger eu mission launched bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirates usually travel in speedboats nato has four ships on patrol in the waters off somalia , with two protecting un food aid convoys to the troubled horn of africa country .
the mission , nato 's first-ever against pirates , ends in mid-december when the more extensive european union operation " atalanta " begins . " the eu presence will be bigger and more designed for the mission , " said nato spokesman james appathurai . according to the eu , the operation will primarily protect vessels of the world food program and other unarmed merchant ships .
up to six european warships will be present , supported by air patrols . their mandate allows them to use force if necessary against pirates . impossible to monitor somalian coastline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hijacked sirius star is carrying oil worth $ 100 million given that the pirates in the region are well-armed with grenades , heavy machine guns and rocket-launchers , most foreign navies have steered clear of direct confrontation once ships have been hijacked , for fear of putting hostages at risk . somalia 's vast coastline is also virtually impossible to monitor completely , even for modern warships . the hijacking of the " sirius star " occurred near the border to kenya , hundreds of kilometers south of the eu-nato mission 's operational area .
she is the largest vessel ever seized and is carrying 100 million dollars of saudi oil .
the supertanker is now at anchor off puntland , a breakaway northern state in somalia .

in addition , projects were under way to provide thousands of shelters for the most desperate refugees before winter fully set in and russia and georgia agreed on the need to facilitate a return of the displaced peoples to their homes .
" our concern is the people themselves , " verbeke said , adding that field visits by the various moderators would continue .
contentious issues to be tackled at a later date the parties said they had agreed to suspend talks on thorny issues likely to derail the meetings and to focus on the areas where there was agreement .

all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .
solarworld bids for opel factories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as opel awaits its fate , solar world make an audacious bid verheugen 's comments came as german solar energy company solarworld announced it had prepared an offer for the four german auto factories owned by opel , worth one billion euros , to create the " first green european car company . "
whatever measures are decided on , rescue action for the auto industry in europe can not come fast enough .
car sales across europe were down 14.5 per cent in october on the same month in 2007 .
the social and financial cost of a bankrupt car industry would be dramatic .
the european car industry provides income for some 12 million families and last year generated a combined turnover of 551 billion euros -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- , or about 5 percent of the continent 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .
solarworld bids for opel factories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as opel awaits its fate , solar world make an audacious bid verheugen 's comments came as german solar energy company solarworld announced it had prepared an offer for the four german auto factories owned by opel , worth one billion euros , to create the " first green european car company . "
whatever measures are decided on , rescue action for the auto industry in europe can not come fast enough .
car sales across europe were down 14.5 per cent in october on the same month in 2007 .
the social and financial cost of a bankrupt car industry would be dramatic .
the european car industry provides income for some 12 million families and last year generated a combined turnover of 551 billion euros -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- , or about 5 percent of the continent 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .
solarworld bids for opel factories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as opel awaits its fate , solar world make an audacious bid verheugen 's comments came as german solar energy company solarworld announced it had prepared an offer for the four german auto factories owned by opel , worth one billion euros , to create the " first green european car company . "
whatever measures are decided on , rescue action for the auto industry in europe can not come fast enough .
car sales across europe were down 14.5 per cent in october on the same month in 2007 .
the social and financial cost of a bankrupt car industry would be dramatic .

the first round of talks last month ended with moscow and tbilisi accusing each other of walking out without the two sides having sat in the same room .
" today , we have taken a big step forward , " said morel , adding that the talks had entered a " fully operational phase . "
the sides also set out priorities for work to go on before the third round , now set for dec .

it remained to be decided if next month 's talks would include a plenary session .

" that fact means that there is a mandate to do something , " said the un 's representative john verbeke , noting that all parties felt " the ceasefire should be respected . "
the georgian official said he wanted to see the observer mandate of the eu and the oece to be extended to include breakaway regions not currently part of the mandate to help aid the planned incident prevention mechanisms and the ceasefire deal .
in addition , projects were under way to provide thousands of shelters for the most desperate refugees before winter fully set in and russia and georgia agreed on the need to facilitate a return of the displaced peoples to their homes .
" our concern is the people themselves , " verbeke said , adding that field visits by the various moderators would continue .
contentious issues to be tackled at a later date the parties said they had agreed to suspend talks on thorny issues likely to derail the meetings and to focus on the areas where there was agreement .

but brussels ' plans have met with criticism in germany . the eu commission would like to ensure that women are better able to combine work and family life .
to that end , self-employed women are to receive paid maternity leave for the first time . additionally , the commission 's proposals would increase the minimum period of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and recommend paying women 100 percent of their salary beyond the current minimum of paying at least equivalent to sick pay . women would have more flexibility to decide when to take the non-compulsory portion of their leave , either before or after childbirth , and would no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of leave before childbirth , as is presently the case in many member states . for most eu member countries , the proposals are more or less in keeping with the way governments already manage maternity leave .
but in germany , there was outrage when the commission unveiled its plans in early october . many women in germany do n't want to give up their jobs in order to raise children .
under german law , they 're entitled to three years of elternzeit , or parental leave , during which they ca n't be fired from their jobs . but the reality is often different .
employers frequently offer women severance pay if they voluntarily quit instead of opting for leave , and many women who do return to their jobs after maternity leave say they feel that they 're the victims of discrimination . the reality in germany is well known to anne seyferth of the friedrich ebert foundation . " compared to other european countries , germany is not exactly among the leaders when it comes to family politics , " she said .
" if we were , then we would n't have such a low birth rate , such a low rate of working mothers , nor such a relatively high number of children who are growing up in poor families . " reality of parental leave in germany sociological studies have shown the best insurance against child poverty is a mother who can work and earn money .
studies have also proven that there is a correlation between the number of children , and women 's employment status : the more mothers who receive adequate compensation for their work , the higher the birth rate .
this is also the basis for the eu commission 's plan to lengthen the period of paid maternity leave .
ultimately , the goal is to increase economic growth , prosperity and competitiveness in the whole european union . petra schott , who works for the commission in the department for employment , social affairs and equal opportunity , said the changes would be a step in the right direction . " women would have more time to recover after giving birth , " she said .
" they 'd have more time to get to know their child and adjust to life with a newborn . " she added that it could also make it easier for working women to find suitable childcare , which would make returning to work less stressful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fathers need encouragement to spend more time with their children , some experts say in principle , germany 's new " elternzeit " scheme is also supposed to be a step in the right direction .
as in sweden , the option to take parental leave is open to both mothers and fathers . but in germany , less than 1 percent of fathers -lrb- around 4,500 men -rrb- actually take advantage of the option to stay home with their babies for a year , said political scientist peter doege , who conducts research on germans balancing family and work . he said with the new maternity leave proposals , the eu commission is showing that it is only thinking of women , as if they 're the only ones for who struggle to balance the demands of a family and a career .
he added that this does n't reflect today 's changing gender expectations . expectant fathers need to become much more involved in the process of both having and raising children , according to doege . " numerous studies have shown that fathers are more active in child-rearing when they feel that the child is just as much theirs - when they also experience pregnancy , " he said .
" those fathers who , for example , attend birth preparation classes , prove to be much more actively involved once the child is born . " longer maternity leave the solution ? the national association of german employers -lrb- bda -rrb- is against lengthening maternity leave .
renate hornung-draus , head of international social policy at the bda , instead calls for mothers and fathers to take equal advantage of parental leave . " you need to combine it such that neither parent ends up losing touch with the working world , but socially and culturally , we 're still far from that , " she said . employers are instead increasingly campaigning for better daycare options for working parents . " that would mean that parents do n't have to make such a radical ' all or nothing ' choice that is so harmful to job continuity and a true work-life balance , " hornung-draus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say creating better daycare options is the way to go hornung-draus has personally experienced both the german and belgian childcare systems .
in germany , it is still assumed that mothers carry the primary care responsibility , whereas in belgium , children are given adequate care and both parents are able to concentrate on their jobs . but maria kathmann from the german unions ' federaton -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said it 's employers who need to change their attitude the most . " if you look at the situation in eastern germany right now , only 57 percent of under-three-year-olds are in daycare , " she said . if you talk with works council representatives or employees , she added , time and again you hear that people have huge problems trying to combine work and family life . kathmann said hiring policies also need to be changed .

" this trial will continue as a closed trial , " said judge yevgeny zubov , who is presiding over the case .
" this is considering the security of the participants in the trial , that of their relatives and their loved ones . "
zubov 's decision came after his ruling on the first day of the trial on monday , when he said the proceedings would be open but that he had the right to close them .
politkovskaya , an award-winning reporter for the novaya gazeta , was a fierce critic of the kremlin 's actions during two wars in chechnya in the early 1990s .
the slain journalist 's family and colleagues have lashed out at the decision .
" i am very disappointed , " a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family , karinna moskalenko , told reporters .
" i think this trial should have been open , not only because all trials should be , but because she was a public figure and the public should know the circumstances of her killing . "
politkovskaya 's son , ilya , said : " of course we do not like the closed trial ...
there is nothing wrong with having journalists there . "
the slain journalist 's family members have sharply criticized the investigation , complaining the defendants on trial are only loosely connected to the contract killing and of the investigation 's secrecy and painstaking progress more than two years after her murder . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this trial will continue as a closed trial , " said judge yevgeny zubov , who is presiding over the case .
" this is considering the security of the participants in the trial , that of their relatives and their loved ones . "
zubov 's decision came after his ruling on the first day of the trial on monday , when he said the proceedings would be open but that he had the right to close them .
politkovskaya , an award-winning reporter for the novaya gazeta , was a fierce critic of the kremlin 's actions during two wars in chechnya in the early 1990s .
the slain journalist 's family and colleagues have lashed out at the decision .
" i am very disappointed , " a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family , karinna moskalenko , told reporters .
" i think this trial should have been open , not only because all trials should be , but because she was a public figure and the public should know the circumstances of her killing . "
politkovskaya 's son , ilya , said : " of course we do not like the closed trial ...
there is nothing wrong with having journalists there . "

19 . " the world financial powers are all in the same boat , " trichet said , adding that joint efforts will have to be made to bring stability to world markets . he added that the fallout was " solvable by joint efforts of authorities and certainly central banks , governments and also the private sector has an essential role to play of course to get out of that situation . " the ecb head noted that the weekend 's g20 financial summit has given " a lot of impetus to speed up the process , and to be as active as possible in implementing what is necessary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 members met for a summit in washington the ecb has been providing large amounts of cash to euro-zone banks to enable them to lend to each other again following weeks of uncertainty that dried markets .
in its most recent move , the ecb cut its key lending rate by 0.50 percentage points to 3.25 percent to bolster the 15-nation euro zone , which had entered recession for the first time after shrinking in the second and third quarters of 2008 . meanwhile , economists are expecting the recession to last longer and have a stronger impact than they had originally predicted .
analysts foresee further interest rate cuts by the ecb . earlier this week , following a speech at the royal institute of international affairs in london , trichet was cautious when commenting on euro-zone developments . " i do n't see yet trends of deflation in the euro area , " he said . deflation is characterized by a general fall in prices and the money supply , while inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time . dw staff -lrb- db -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with a limited mandate , their ships can not keep armed bandits from seizing merchant vessels and taking hostages . pirates off the coast of somalia captured another ship on wednesday , nov .
19 .
it is the third vessel since the spectacular hijacking of the saudi supertanker " sirius star " last weekend . although nato , european and us vessels are stationed in the region , they are helpless in effectively battling the increasing problem of piracy - though single operations are sometimes successful . the german navy , for example , said tuesday one of its frigates had foiled attacks on two ships in the gulf of aden , using a helicopter to chase off pirates who fled in their speedboats . larger eu mission launched bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirates usually travel in speedboats nato has four ships on patrol in the waters off somalia , with two protecting un food aid convoys to the troubled horn of africa country .
the mission , nato 's first-ever against pirates , ends in mid-december when the more extensive european union operation " atalanta " begins . " the eu presence will be bigger and more designed for the mission , " said nato spokesman james appathurai . according to the eu , the operation will primarily protect vessels of the world food program and other unarmed merchant ships .
up to six european warships will be present , supported by air patrols . their mandate allows them to use force if necessary against pirates . impossible to monitor somalian coastline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hijacked sirius star is carrying oil worth $ 100 million given that the pirates in the region are well-armed with grenades , heavy machine guns and rocket-launchers , most foreign navies have steered clear of direct confrontation once ships have been hijacked , for fear of putting hostages at risk . somalia 's vast coastline is also virtually impossible to monitor completely , even for modern warships . the hijacking of the " sirius star " occurred near the border to kenya , hundreds of kilometers south of the eu-nato mission 's operational area .
she is the largest vessel ever seized and is carrying 100 million dollars of saudi oil .
the supertanker is now at anchor off puntland , a breakaway northern state in somalia .
nato said it had no intention of intervening or rescuing the ship and crew . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but brussels ' plans have met with criticism in germany . the eu commission would like to ensure that women are better able to combine work and family life .
to that end , self-employed women are to receive paid maternity leave for the first time . additionally , the commission 's proposals would increase the minimum period of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and recommend paying women 100 percent of their salary beyond the current minimum of paying at least equivalent to sick pay . women would have more flexibility to decide when to take the non-compulsory portion of their leave , either before or after childbirth , and would no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of leave before childbirth , as is presently the case in many member states . for most eu member countries , the proposals are more or less in keeping with the way governments already manage maternity leave .
but in germany , there was outrage when the commission unveiled its plans in early october . many women in germany do n't want to give up their jobs in order to raise children .
under german law , they 're entitled to three years of elternzeit , or parental leave , during which they ca n't be fired from their jobs . but the reality is often different .
employers frequently offer women severance pay if they voluntarily quit instead of opting for leave , and many women who do return to their jobs after maternity leave say they feel that they 're the victims of discrimination . the reality in germany is well known to anne seyferth of the friedrich ebert foundation . " compared to other european countries , germany is not exactly among the leaders when it comes to family politics , " she said .
" if we were , then we would n't have such a low birth rate , such a low rate of working mothers , nor such a relatively high number of children who are growing up in poor families . " reality of parental leave in germany sociological studies have shown the best insurance against child poverty is a mother who can work and earn money .
studies have also proven that there is a correlation between the number of children , and women 's employment status : the more mothers who receive adequate compensation for their work , the higher the birth rate .
this is also the basis for the eu commission 's plan to lengthen the period of paid maternity leave .
ultimately , the goal is to increase economic growth , prosperity and competitiveness in the whole european union . petra schott , who works for the commission in the department for employment , social affairs and equal opportunity , said the changes would be a step in the right direction . " women would have more time to recover after giving birth , " she said .

as in sweden , the option to take parental leave is open to both mothers and fathers . but in germany , less than 1 percent of fathers -lrb- around 4,500 men -rrb- actually take advantage of the option to stay home with their babies for a year , said political scientist peter doege , who conducts research on germans balancing family and work . he said with the new maternity leave proposals , the eu commission is showing that it is only thinking of women , as if they 're the only ones for who struggle to balance the demands of a family and a career .
he added that this does n't reflect today 's changing gender expectations . expectant fathers need to become much more involved in the process of both having and raising children , according to doege .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 19.11.2008 german minister : eu plans massive economic aid package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the package might be too small the european union is planning to unveil an economic stimulus package worth 130 billion euros , german economics minister michael glos said wednesday .
all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .
solarworld bids for opel factories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as opel awaits its fate , solar world make an audacious bid verheugen 's comments came as german solar energy company solarworld announced it had prepared an offer for the four german auto factories owned by opel , worth one billion euros , to create the " first green european car company . "
whatever measures are decided on , rescue action for the auto industry in europe can not come fast enough .

all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .
solarworld bids for opel factories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as opel awaits its fate , solar world make an audacious bid verheugen 's comments came as german solar energy company solarworld announced it had prepared an offer for the four german auto factories owned by opel , worth one billion euros , to create the " first green european car company . "
whatever measures are decided on , rescue action for the auto industry in europe can not come fast enough .

all member states will be expected to chip in . glos told private german tv news channel n-tv that each eu country would be expected to contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to the package .
he added that this would amount to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.61 billion -rrb- for germany . according to news reports , details of the package are supposed to be announced on nov .
26 , with eu leaders possibly approving the plan at their summit on dec .
10 . backing green research european union officials were meanwhile also edging towards a plan which will tie any state aid for european carmakers to technological development and the production of environmentally-friendly vehicles . following on from the large-scale rescue efforts made by eu member states to help europe 's worst-hit banks , the auto sector has become the second front in the economic battle against the global financial crisis .
but instead of bailing out the auto industry with huge amounts of cash , officials in brussels want to make sure any aid given to the faltering auto sector is closely targeted and eco-friendly .
" there wo n't be subsidies , and besides the industry is not asking for subsidies , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said a week ahead of the presentation of an economic re-launch plan in brussels , which will include measures to help the auto industry .
verheugen called for the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to increase its credit line " for makers of more eco-friendly cars " in a bid to encourage the industry to earn aid through committing to more eco-friendly product ranges .
verheugen also called for " ecological rigor , " speaking of fiscal incentives to increase the demand for " green " vehicles .
verheugen 's statement follows on from a similar plea by the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- in october .
the acea called for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans , not grants , to develop green technologies .
eib in favor of investing in green loans , says commissioner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eib wo n't just hand out cash - companies must earn it the eib , the eu 's lending arm , is in favor of such a move which would promote green technologies , verheugen added , telling the european parliament in strasbourg that finance ministers " will take the decisions to introduce the move " at a special meeting in dec .
2 .
on monday the eib said it was ready to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .
" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters .
part of the money would be earmarked to help the transport industry , especially for the development of greener cars , the spokesman said , without giving an amount .
the eib has handed out an average of two billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years .
to allow the eib increase to go ahead , eu nations will have to provide the european investment bank with " the necessary resources , " said france 's european affairs minister , jean-pierre jouyet , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu has committed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and such funding could help achieve that , he added .
verheugen calls opel strife a " special case " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is undecided over opel 's state aid claim despite his assertions that " green " incentives were the best way forward for helping the auto industry , verheugen referred to the current crisis at german car manufacturer opel as a " special case " in europe .
" extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures , " verheugen said ; although he went on to say that he was not fully decided about the proposed multibillion-euro aid package from the german government .
the european union has strict rules on state-aid for industry , in the interest of maintaining competitiveness across the 27-member bloc .
however , verheugen said it was " in no-one 's interest " that opel be allowed to fail .
opel would be a competitive firm , he said , were it not for the critical situation of opel 's us parent company , general motors .
opel has asked the german government for one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- in credit guarantees to tide it over through a potential liquidity crisis that could arise if gm runs out of cash .
according to press reports opel , which made its first car in 1899 and which gm has owned since 1929 , needs up to two billion euros in guarantees .
germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- want state aid to be given to the car industry and have called for any such rescue packages to be used as an incentive to make more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
" research into environmentally-friendly cars is the future , " said spd representative matthias groote .
" it 's not only ecologically worthwhile , it 's economically worthwhile , " he said .
solarworld bids for opel factories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as opel awaits its fate , solar world make an audacious bid verheugen 's comments came as german solar energy company solarworld announced it had prepared an offer for the four german auto factories owned by opel , worth one billion euros , to create the " first green european car company . "
whatever measures are decided on , rescue action for the auto industry in europe can not come fast enough .
car sales across europe were down 14.5 per cent in october on the same month in 2007 .
the social and financial cost of a bankrupt car industry would be dramatic .
the european car industry provides income for some 12 million families and last year generated a combined turnover of 551 billion euros -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- , or about 5 percent of the continent 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 19.11.2008 germany criticizes eu changes to maternity leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say the proposals focus on women the eu commission would like to make it easier for new mothers to return to the workplace by providing longer and better paid maternity leave .
but brussels ' plans have met with criticism in germany . the eu commission would like to ensure that women are better able to combine work and family life .
to that end , self-employed women are to receive paid maternity leave for the first time . additionally , the commission 's proposals would increase the minimum period of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and recommend paying women 100 percent of their salary beyond the current minimum of paying at least equivalent to sick pay . women would have more flexibility to decide when to take the non-compulsory portion of their leave , either before or after childbirth , and would no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of leave before childbirth , as is presently the case in many member states . for most eu member countries , the proposals are more or less in keeping with the way governments already manage maternity leave .
but in germany , there was outrage when the commission unveiled its plans in early october . many women in germany do n't want to give up their jobs in order to raise children .
under german law , they 're entitled to three years of elternzeit , or parental leave , during which they ca n't be fired from their jobs . but the reality is often different .
employers frequently offer women severance pay if they voluntarily quit instead of opting for leave , and many women who do return to their jobs after maternity leave say they feel that they 're the victims of discrimination . the reality in germany is well known to anne seyferth of the friedrich ebert foundation . " compared to other european countries , germany is not exactly among the leaders when it comes to family politics , " she said .
" if we were , then we would n't have such a low birth rate , such a low rate of working mothers , nor such a relatively high number of children who are growing up in poor families . " reality of parental leave in germany sociological studies have shown the best insurance against child poverty is a mother who can work and earn money .
studies have also proven that there is a correlation between the number of children , and women 's employment status : the more mothers who receive adequate compensation for their work , the higher the birth rate .
this is also the basis for the eu commission 's plan to lengthen the period of paid maternity leave .
ultimately , the goal is to increase economic growth , prosperity and competitiveness in the whole european union . petra schott , who works for the commission in the department for employment , social affairs and equal opportunity , said the changes would be a step in the right direction . " women would have more time to recover after giving birth , " she said .
" they 'd have more time to get to know their child and adjust to life with a newborn . " she added that it could also make it easier for working women to find suitable childcare , which would make returning to work less stressful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fathers need encouragement to spend more time with their children , some experts say in principle , germany 's new " elternzeit " scheme is also supposed to be a step in the right direction .
as in sweden , the option to take parental leave is open to both mothers and fathers . but in germany , less than 1 percent of fathers -lrb- around 4,500 men -rrb- actually take advantage of the option to stay home with their babies for a year , said political scientist peter doege , who conducts research on germans balancing family and work . he said with the new maternity leave proposals , the eu commission is showing that it is only thinking of women , as if they 're the only ones for who struggle to balance the demands of a family and a career .
he added that this does n't reflect today 's changing gender expectations . expectant fathers need to become much more involved in the process of both having and raising children , according to doege . " numerous studies have shown that fathers are more active in child-rearing when they feel that the child is just as much theirs - when they also experience pregnancy , " he said .
" those fathers who , for example , attend birth preparation classes , prove to be much more actively involved once the child is born . " longer maternity leave the solution ? the national association of german employers -lrb- bda -rrb- is against lengthening maternity leave .
renate hornung-draus , head of international social policy at the bda , instead calls for mothers and fathers to take equal advantage of parental leave . " you need to combine it such that neither parent ends up losing touch with the working world , but socially and culturally , we 're still far from that , " she said . employers are instead increasingly campaigning for better daycare options for working parents . " that would mean that parents do n't have to make such a radical ' all or nothing ' choice that is so harmful to job continuity and a true work-life balance , " hornung-draus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say creating better daycare options is the way to go hornung-draus has personally experienced both the german and belgian childcare systems .
in germany , it is still assumed that mothers carry the primary care responsibility , whereas in belgium , children are given adequate care and both parents are able to concentrate on their jobs . but maria kathmann from the german unions ' federaton -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said it 's employers who need to change their attitude the most . " if you look at the situation in eastern germany right now , only 57 percent of under-three-year-olds are in daycare , " she said . if you talk with works council representatives or employees , she added , time and again you hear that people have huge problems trying to combine work and family life . kathmann said hiring policies also need to be changed .

to that end , self-employed women are to receive paid maternity leave for the first time . additionally , the commission 's proposals would increase the minimum period of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and recommend paying women 100 percent of their salary beyond the current minimum of paying at least equivalent to sick pay . women would have more flexibility to decide when to take the non-compulsory portion of their leave , either before or after childbirth , and would no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of leave before childbirth , as is presently the case in many member states . for most eu member countries , the proposals are more or less in keeping with the way governments already manage maternity leave .
but in germany , there was outrage when the commission unveiled its plans in early october . many women in germany do n't want to give up their jobs in order to raise children .
under german law , they 're entitled to three years of elternzeit , or parental leave , during which they ca n't be fired from their jobs . but the reality is often different .
employers frequently offer women severance pay if they voluntarily quit instead of opting for leave , and many women who do return to their jobs after maternity leave say they feel that they 're the victims of discrimination . the reality in germany is well known to anne seyferth of the friedrich ebert foundation . " compared to other european countries , germany is not exactly among the leaders when it comes to family politics , " she said .
" if we were , then we would n't have such a low birth rate , such a low rate of working mothers , nor such a relatively high number of children who are growing up in poor families . " reality of parental leave in germany sociological studies have shown the best insurance against child poverty is a mother who can work and earn money .
studies have also proven that there is a correlation between the number of children , and women 's employment status : the more mothers who receive adequate compensation for their work , the higher the birth rate .
this is also the basis for the eu commission 's plan to lengthen the period of paid maternity leave .
ultimately , the goal is to increase economic growth , prosperity and competitiveness in the whole european union . petra schott , who works for the commission in the department for employment , social affairs and equal opportunity , said the changes would be a step in the right direction . " women would have more time to recover after giving birth , " she said .
" they 'd have more time to get to know their child and adjust to life with a newborn . " she added that it could also make it easier for working women to find suitable childcare , which would make returning to work less stressful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fathers need encouragement to spend more time with their children , some experts say in principle , germany 's new " elternzeit " scheme is also supposed to be a step in the right direction .
as in sweden , the option to take parental leave is open to both mothers and fathers . but in germany , less than 1 percent of fathers -lrb- around 4,500 men -rrb- actually take advantage of the option to stay home with their babies for a year , said political scientist peter doege , who conducts research on germans balancing family and work . he said with the new maternity leave proposals , the eu commission is showing that it is only thinking of women , as if they 're the only ones for who struggle to balance the demands of a family and a career .
he added that this does n't reflect today 's changing gender expectations . expectant fathers need to become much more involved in the process of both having and raising children , according to doege . " numerous studies have shown that fathers are more active in child-rearing when they feel that the child is just as much theirs - when they also experience pregnancy , " he said .
" those fathers who , for example , attend birth preparation classes , prove to be much more actively involved once the child is born . " longer maternity leave the solution ? the national association of german employers -lrb- bda -rrb- is against lengthening maternity leave .
renate hornung-draus , head of international social policy at the bda , instead calls for mothers and fathers to take equal advantage of parental leave . " you need to combine it such that neither parent ends up losing touch with the working world , but socially and culturally , we 're still far from that , " she said . employers are instead increasingly campaigning for better daycare options for working parents . " that would mean that parents do n't have to make such a radical ' all or nothing ' choice that is so harmful to job continuity and a true work-life balance , " hornung-draus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say creating better daycare options is the way to go hornung-draus has personally experienced both the german and belgian childcare systems .
in germany , it is still assumed that mothers carry the primary care responsibility , whereas in belgium , children are given adequate care and both parents are able to concentrate on their jobs . but maria kathmann from the german unions ' federaton -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said it 's employers who need to change their attitude the most . " if you look at the situation in eastern germany right now , only 57 percent of under-three-year-olds are in daycare , " she said . if you talk with works council representatives or employees , she added , time and again you hear that people have huge problems trying to combine work and family life . kathmann said hiring policies also need to be changed . " it has a lot to do with the current employment culture of presence and showing your face , and with the expectation from employers to first select staff members who have nothing else going on in the background .

the french eu presidency , however , said a military solution was not the answer . the crisis in the democratic republic of congo should be resolved by a " balanced political solution based on dialog , " according to the european union . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and french european affairs minister jean-pierre jouyet said a further dialog had to include the un , the eu , the african union as well as regional african organizations .
both politicians were speaking before the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , nov .

" we want them to reach a result very quickly , " jouyet said .
he said the eu was willing to increase its financial contribution to the un in order to help stabilize the region . industry 's responsibility to dr congo according to ferrero-waldner , monuc needed more power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masisi region contains important deposits of coltan " the mandate should be extended , for example , in terms of its control over the pillaging of natural resources , " she said .
monuc forces have come under criticism for failing to do enough to stop the violence . ferrero-waldner said she was " very pleased " with the latest diplomatic efforts by other african countries and individuals .
but now it was " high time to analyze the real causes for the crisis , " she said .
this included looting mines and oppressing minorities . several members of the european parliament said international companies should also be made to accept responsibility for controlling the exploitation of dr congo 's natural resources .
the country 's diamonds , zinc , gold and coltan are used in the communications and consumer electronics industries . nkunda 's ambitious plans rebel chief laurent nkunda told the german weekly die zeit he wanted to extend his control to include the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general nkunda aims to take over the whole of congo " under my leadership , the dr congo will be sitting in the un security council representing africa within five years time , " nkunda said in an interview published wednesday . he accused the current government of failure , saying it had sold out the country to the chinese and cooperated with " criminals . " nkunda has promised to take action against the ever-present corruption in dr congo and make it an internationally recognized country . the un mission in dr congo said wednesday that nkunda 's rebels had started withdrawing from conflict zones around two towns in the east of the country .
more than 250,000 people have been displaced since fighting erupted between nkunda 's rebels and the military in nord-kivu province in late august . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the french eu presidency , however , said a military solution was not the answer . the crisis in the democratic republic of congo should be resolved by a " balanced political solution based on dialog , " according to the european union . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and french european affairs minister jean-pierre jouyet said a further dialog had to include the un , the eu , the african union as well as regional african organizations .
both politicians were speaking before the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , nov .
19 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces control parts of eastern dr congo by goma " let 's be clear and lucid , this crisis can not be resolved without boosting the means for peace stabilization , particularly those of the united nations , " said jouyet , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency . earlier this week , france submitted a draft resolution at the un security council to add 3,000 soldiers and police to the 17,000-strong un mission in dr congo , monuc . " we want them to reach a result very quickly , " jouyet said .
he said the eu was willing to increase its financial contribution to the un in order to help stabilize the region . industry 's responsibility to dr congo according to ferrero-waldner , monuc needed more power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masisi region contains important deposits of coltan " the mandate should be extended , for example , in terms of its control over the pillaging of natural resources , " she said .
monuc forces have come under criticism for failing to do enough to stop the violence . ferrero-waldner said she was " very pleased " with the latest diplomatic efforts by other african countries and individuals .
but now it was " high time to analyze the real causes for the crisis , " she said .
this included looting mines and oppressing minorities . several members of the european parliament said international companies should also be made to accept responsibility for controlling the exploitation of dr congo 's natural resources .
the country 's diamonds , zinc , gold and coltan are used in the communications and consumer electronics industries . nkunda 's ambitious plans rebel chief laurent nkunda told the german weekly die zeit he wanted to extend his control to include the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general nkunda aims to take over the whole of congo " under my leadership , the dr congo will be sitting in the un security council representing africa within five years time , " nkunda said in an interview published wednesday . he accused the current government of failure , saying it had sold out the country to the chinese and cooperated with " criminals . " nkunda has promised to take action against the ever-present corruption in dr congo and make it an internationally recognized country . the un mission in dr congo said wednesday that nkunda 's rebels had started withdrawing from conflict zones around two towns in the east of the country .
more than 250,000 people have been displaced since fighting erupted between nkunda 's rebels and the military in nord-kivu province in late august . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the bnp exposed , " says the daily mirror 's front page .
inside , the paper says members may now face reprisals and are " running scared " .
times ' columnist david aaronovitch believes that being a member of the far-right is " not unlike the transient population of a seedy guesthouse " .
" you might stay there , but you might not give it out as an address . "

the daily mail says she was " virtually bedridden " before receiving the new windpipe .
" a life renewed , " it adds .
a " medical miracle " is how the independent describes the procedure .
it quotes scientists who herald it as the dawn of " a new age for surgery " .

mr de villepin is suspected of targeting mr sarkozy when the pair were seen as presidential rivals in 2004 .
mr de villepin has already been questioned over the case but has always denied spreading false money laundering allegations against mr sarkozy .
he has accused investigators of being biased in favour of the president .
mr de villepin was questioned over the so-called " clearstream affair " in december 2006 and has been under investigation since 2007 .
he is alleged to have helped leak a fake list of individuals , including mr sarkozy , said to have benefited from illegal arms sale commissions .
in a statement sent to news agencies , mr de villepin said that " nothing can justify this decision " .
" throughout the investigation , the truth of the facts and the law have been diverted for the benefit of one civil party who is at the same time today president of the republic , " he said , referring to mr sarkozy .
mr de villepin and mr sarkozy were both ministers under president chirac , but were intense rivals .
mr de villepin was preferred by mr chirac , but it was mr sarkozy who won party support to succeed the president .

republican ted stevens , 85 , served six terms in office as senator for alaska and to many he was simply mr alaska , uncle ted .
but his bid for a seventh term in office was thrown into controversy when he was convicted of lying about gifts he had received from oil company veco .
and analysts say the guilty verdict helped scupper his chances of winning re-election to the senate in the 4 november election .
mr stevens is the longest-serving senate republican , first winning his seat in 1968 .
throughout this time he played a crucial role in shaping the economic and social development of alaska , which only became a state in 1959 .
federal funds in 2000 he was named as alaskan of the century and the main airport was renamed in his honour .
the plaudits were in response to the millions of dollars in federal aid and funding he has channelled towards his state during his long political career .
for mr stevens , the money he has managed to secure for alaska and alaskans is good government .
" the only special interest i care about is alaska , " he has said .
but to his critics , mr stevens is the " king of pork " , managing to attach funds for his pet projects on to all manner of legislation .
citizens against government waste , an independent watchdog , estimates that between 1995 and 2008 he has managed to channel some $ 3.4bn -lrb- £ 1.8bn -rrb- alaska 's way .
arguably his most controversial move came in 2005 , when he pushed to get more than $ 200m -lrb- £ 107m -rrb- of federal earmarks to build alaska 's " bridge to nowhere " , a project that was ultimately dropped .
' tubes ' during his long political career , mr stevens has served on many senate committees , including as chairman of the committee on commerce , science and transportation and the ethics , rules , and governmental affairs committees .
stevens ' political highlights joined the army air corp during wwii degrees at ucla and harvard law school elected to alaska house of representatives in 1964 appointed to the us senate in 1968 he served as president pro tem of the senate from 2003 to 2007 , which put him third in line for the presidency .
mr stevens , as his effectiveness in securing funds highlights , is a canny political operator , managing to negotiate with republicans and democrats alike to pass legislation important for his state .
he has been a vocal advocate of opening up the arctic national wildlife refuge , anwr , to oil drilling , an increasingly controversial issue in the us .
in 2006 , he was widely lampooned when he referred to the internet as " a series of tubes that get clogged " during a debate , a description that rapidly became a catchphrase on the web .
but since july 2008 , his image has been tarnished by the veco controversy .
mr stevens 's bid to be returned to the senate in november 's election looked tough even before he was found guilty on 27 october .
he lost out in a knife-edge race against anchorage mayor mark begich , giving the senate its first democratic representative from alaska for 30 years .

stevens ' political highlights joined the army air corp during wwii degrees at ucla and harvard law school elected to alaska house of representatives in 1964 appointed to the us senate in 1968 he served as president pro tem of the senate from 2003 to 2007 , which put him third in line for the presidency .
mr stevens , as his effectiveness in securing funds highlights , is a canny political operator , managing to negotiate with republicans and democrats alike to pass legislation important for his state .
he has been a vocal advocate of opening up the arctic national wildlife refuge , anwr , to oil drilling , an increasingly controversial issue in the us .
in 2006 , he was widely lampooned when he referred to the internet as " a series of tubes that get clogged " during a debate , a description that rapidly became a catchphrase on the web .
but since july 2008 , his image has been tarnished by the veco controversy .
mr stevens 's bid to be returned to the senate in november 's election looked tough even before he was found guilty on 27 october .
he lost out in a knife-edge race against anchorage mayor mark begich , giving the senate its first democratic representative from alaska for 30 years .

environment minister jane davidson committed wales to becoming a " one planet nation " , using only its " fair share " of the world 's resources .

a spokesman clarified the timescale envisaged as being around " 30 to 40 years " .
last month , the uk government pledged to cut carbon emissions by 80 % by 2050 .

environment minister jane davidson committed wales to becoming a " one planet nation " , using only its " fair share " of the world 's resources .
the targets include an 80 % -90 % cut in carbon-based energy and a move towards recycling or re-using all waste .
but the conservatives said " appalling " local council funding deals would hinder efforts to achieve the goal .
a consultation document , ' one wales : one planet ' said the aim was to achieve the targets " within the lifetime of a generation " .
a spokesman clarified the timescale envisaged as being around " 30 to 40 years " .
last month , the uk government pledged to cut carbon emissions by 80 % by 2050 .
the assembly government report said there was a need to " organise the way we live and work so we can travel less by car , wherever possible , and can live and work in ways which have a much stronger connection with our local economies and communities " .
using more locally grown food and in season was also proposed. within our small nation we are using 2.7 planets worth of resources ... we can not go on like this jane davidson , environment minister ms davidson said ministers would use all their powers " from health , transport to education - to lessen wales ' environmental impact on the world and help protect our country for future generations . "
" for the first time , we have committed ourselves to becoming a one planet nation - to only use our fair share of resources to sustain our lifestyles , " she said .
" wales ' ecological footprint is currently 5.16 global hectares per person , compared to a global availability of 1.88 global hectares .
" it tells us that within our small nation we are using 2.7 planets worth of resources to sustain our lifestyles .
" unchecked , this could rise by 20 % by 2020 , the equivalent of 3.3 planets worth of resources .
" we can not go on like this , " ms davidson added .
earlier in november , the minister launched a " green charter " with 40 construction industry bodies to cut carbon emissions .
one planet targets 80-90 % cut in carbon-based energy use move towards ' zero waste ' by recycling / re-using change the way we live and work to cut car travel make sustainable development a core objective of nhs wales support more sustainable development schemes in education use more local produce and in season reduce the gap between rich and poor tackle child and fuel poverty source : welsh assembly government ' one wales : one planet ' friends of the earth cymru said a 90 % reduction in use of carbon-based energy was " ambitious " but " absolutely necessary " , given the scientific evidence on the seriousness of the threat from climate change .
campaigner haf elgar said it was " doubtful whether this 90 % target can be achieved quickly enough by the welsh assembly government 's current commitment to 3 % annual reductions " .
" we have to look seriously at the 9 % cuts being considered by the -lrb- assembly -rrb- government 's own climate change commission , " she added .
the conservatives accused the minister of offering " hollow promises " rather than action .
party environment spokesman darren millar said : " the minister has yet to fulfil her pledges on the devolution of building regulations and new powers over large energy developments , environmental protection , and waste management .
" without these there is little prospect of delivery on today 's pledges . "
consultation on the plan is due to run until 4 february .
