but others will find it more difficult to get work visas for germany . the cabinet on wednesday , july 16 , decided to ease restrictions on highly qualified workers , effectively opening its borders to those with university or higher qualifications from 10 new eu countries from the beginning of next year . german employers will from then on no longer have to show that there are no suitably qualified applicants from germany or older eu nations in order to hire a suitable candidate from a new member country .
german businesses have long complained of a chronic lack of highly trained workers such as engineers and computer programers .
" germany must take part in an international competition to attract bright minds , " labor minister olaf scholz said .
however , restrictions on lower qualified workers from poland , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , hungary , estonia , latvia and lithuania , which joined the eu in may 2004 , remain in force until april 30 , 2011 . in the case of bulgaria and romania , which joined the bloc at the beginning of 2007 , the restrictions will be lifted only from the beginning of 2012 . the cabinet also decided to ensure an adequate supply of seasonal agricultural workers , many of whom come from eastern european countries . preference to german-learners restrictions were also eased for those foreign applicants who can show knowledge of the german language and culture by having attended german schools abroad . germany was one of many eu countries that closed its labor market to the eight eastern european countries that joined the eu in 2004 , along with cyprus and malta . the restrictions were imposed for three years and then extended for a further two years to 2009 . britain , ireland and sweden opened their labor markets immediately , and most other " old " eu members , including france , have since followed . small steps toward minimum wage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minimum wage already exists in just a few sectors in germany also on wednesday , the german cabinet agreed after extensive political debate to introduce minimum wage regulations in more sectors of the labor market .
which sectors those will be , however , has not yet been decided .
construction workers , janitors and letter carriers are already guaranteed a minimum wage under german law . the regulations are aimed at countering wage dumping and low-wage competition .
labor minister olaf scholz praised the agreement , saying that " it is a good day for many employees who work hard and earn little . " economics minister michael glos , who 'd resisted the move , said nevertheless that the government had " pushed through the most economically friendly solution .

but others will find it more difficult to get work visas for germany . the cabinet on wednesday , july 16 , decided to ease restrictions on highly qualified workers , effectively opening its borders to those with university or higher qualifications from 10 new eu countries from the beginning of next year . german employers will from then on no longer have to show that there are no suitably qualified applicants from germany or older eu nations in order to hire a suitable candidate from a new member country .
german businesses have long complained of a chronic lack of highly trained workers such as engineers and computer programers .
" germany must take part in an international competition to attract bright minds , " labor minister olaf scholz said .
however , restrictions on lower qualified workers from poland , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , hungary , estonia , latvia and lithuania , which joined the eu in may 2004 , remain in force until april 30 , 2011 . in the case of bulgaria and romania , which joined the bloc at the beginning of 2007 , the restrictions will be lifted only from the beginning of 2012 . the cabinet also decided to ensure an adequate supply of seasonal agricultural workers , many of whom come from eastern european countries . preference to german-learners restrictions were also eased for those foreign applicants who can show knowledge of the german language and culture by having attended german schools abroad . germany was one of many eu countries that closed its labor market to the eight eastern european countries that joined the eu in 2004 , along with cyprus and malta . the restrictions were imposed for three years and then extended for a further two years to 2009 . britain , ireland and sweden opened their labor markets immediately , and most other " old " eu members , including france , have since followed . small steps toward minimum wage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minimum wage already exists in just a few sectors in germany also on wednesday , the german cabinet agreed after extensive political debate to introduce minimum wage regulations in more sectors of the labor market .
which sectors those will be , however , has not yet been decided .
construction workers , janitors and letter carriers are already guaranteed a minimum wage under german law . the regulations are aimed at countering wage dumping and low-wage competition .
labor minister olaf scholz praised the agreement , saying that " it is a good day for many employees who work hard and earn little . " economics minister michael glos , who 'd resisted the move , said nevertheless that the government had " pushed through the most economically friendly solution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 16.07.2008 ruthless olympic pursuit stirs animosity in german swim team großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poleska -lrb- left -rrb- took the olympic slot but bernhardt took the case to court - and won it may have been a victory for the rule book and for those who preach the following of the law to the letter , but german swimmer vipa bernhardt will certainly not win any team building prizes in the near future . bernhardt came out victorious in her court case to have compatriot swimmer anne poleska dumped from the german olympic team on tuesday , july 15 after pursuing a tenuous legal thread in a bid to supplant her on the squad .
the court injunction , heard by the state court in kassel late on monday , forced the german national olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- to scratch poleska - who finished second in the qualifying trial - in favor of third-placed bernhardt , much to the chagrin of dosb president thomas bach .
bernhardt finished third in the 200 meters breaststroke at the german national championships in april , just failing to get a top two spot needed to make the team for beijing .
rather than graciously facing the fact that she had come up just short , bernhardt ruthlessly exposed a footnote law within the rules of the german championships to force the hand of the dosb .
rival poleska accused of breaking club rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poleska says she did n't race as a club member in the us the court in kessel heard that poleska - a born-and-bred german , a national champion and olympic bronze medalist from athens 2004 - had previously raced for the coral springs swimming club in florida and not a german club .
german swimming federation rules allow athletes to compete for foreign college or school swimming teams but not foreign clubs .
" i 've never seen anything like this before - an athlete trying to box her way onto the team because of a technicality , a mistake by a colleague , " bach told reporters .
poleska said she had done nothing wrong and was not a member of any club when she swam in the florida meets .
" i see my position as crystal clear from a legal point of view , " she said .
" i 'm not afraid at all that i 'll miss the olympics . "
germany 's olympic swimming coach orjan madsen was also sure that poleska and not bernhardt would be representing germany in beijing .
" ' the fact is that anne was nominated by the dosb and already has her olympic team clothes that she 'll be traveling to beijing in , " he said .
michael wolski , a lawyer and chairman of bernhardt 's club sg frankfurt which filed the legal challenge on her behalf , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung he had presented documents showing poleska took part in 10 club meets for coral springs .
" i can not imagine she did not know the rules , " wolski was quoted by the paper as saying .
" everyone knows those rules . "
this is not the first time that national german law has stood in the way of a fair outcome as viewed from a sporting perspective .
former gdr swimmer astrid strauss was banned for failing a doping test , but continued to race inside a reunified germany after her international ban because a judge decided it only fair .
bernhardt 's inclusion could lead to more court action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhardt can expect little support in the german team an executive board meeting will decide on july 20 if another swimmer will be pushed out of the german team by the decision forced by bernhardt 's undeserved olympic selection .
if this were to happen , bernhardt could well expect to spend more time in court than in the pool as the board 's decision would surely be the subject of a legal claim by the displaced swimmer .
if bernhardt does fly to beijing , it 's unlikely that she will be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the squad , especially those on the swimming team who will know that the third-best , and not second best , swimmer made the team and after a dirty legal challenge that went against all unwritten rules of sportsmanship .
more drama could follow if she is allowed in the squad .
olympic rules state that each country can only field two 200 meter breaststroke competitors .
with bernhardt making it three , she could cause further ill-feeling by getting the nod ahead of one of the other swimmers .
what is more likely in this scenario is that bernhardt will be forced to sit on the bench . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court injunction , heard by the state court in kassel late on monday , forced the german national olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- to scratch poleska - who finished second in the qualifying trial - in favor of third-placed bernhardt , much to the chagrin of dosb president thomas bach .
bernhardt finished third in the 200 meters breaststroke at the german national championships in april , just failing to get a top two spot needed to make the team for beijing .
rather than graciously facing the fact that she had come up just short , bernhardt ruthlessly exposed a footnote law within the rules of the german championships to force the hand of the dosb .
rival poleska accused of breaking club rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poleska says she did n't race as a club member in the us the court in kessel heard that poleska - a born-and-bred german , a national champion and olympic bronze medalist from athens 2004 - had previously raced for the coral springs swimming club in florida and not a german club .
german swimming federation rules allow athletes to compete for foreign college or school swimming teams but not foreign clubs .
" i 've never seen anything like this before - an athlete trying to box her way onto the team because of a technicality , a mistake by a colleague , " bach told reporters .
poleska said she had done nothing wrong and was not a member of any club when she swam in the florida meets .
" i see my position as crystal clear from a legal point of view , " she said .
" i 'm not afraid at all that i 'll miss the olympics . "
germany 's olympic swimming coach orjan madsen was also sure that poleska and not bernhardt would be representing germany in beijing .
" ' the fact is that anne was nominated by the dosb and already has her olympic team clothes that she 'll be traveling to beijing in , " he said .
michael wolski , a lawyer and chairman of bernhardt 's club sg frankfurt which filed the legal challenge on her behalf , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung he had presented documents showing poleska took part in 10 club meets for coral springs .
" i can not imagine she did not know the rules , " wolski was quoted by the paper as saying .
" everyone knows those rules . "
this is not the first time that national german law has stood in the way of a fair outcome as viewed from a sporting perspective .
former gdr swimmer astrid strauss was banned for failing a doping test , but continued to race inside a reunified germany after her international ban because a judge decided it only fair .
bernhardt 's inclusion could lead to more court action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhardt can expect little support in the german team an executive board meeting will decide on july 20 if another swimmer will be pushed out of the german team by the decision forced by bernhardt 's undeserved olympic selection .
if this were to happen , bernhardt could well expect to spend more time in court than in the pool as the board 's decision would surely be the subject of a legal claim by the displaced swimmer .
if bernhardt does fly to beijing , it 's unlikely that she will be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the squad , especially those on the swimming team who will know that the third-best , and not second best , swimmer made the team and after a dirty legal challenge that went against all unwritten rules of sportsmanship .
more drama could follow if she is allowed in the squad .
olympic rules state that each country can only field two 200 meter breaststroke competitors .
with bernhardt making it three , she could cause further ill-feeling by getting the nod ahead of one of the other swimmers .
what is more likely in this scenario is that bernhardt will be forced to sit on the bench . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's olympic swimming coach orjan madsen was also sure that poleska and not bernhardt would be representing germany in beijing .
" ' the fact is that anne was nominated by the dosb and already has her olympic team clothes that she 'll be traveling to beijing in , " he said .
michael wolski , a lawyer and chairman of bernhardt 's club sg frankfurt which filed the legal challenge on her behalf , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung he had presented documents showing poleska took part in 10 club meets for coral springs .
" i can not imagine she did not know the rules , " wolski was quoted by the paper as saying .
" everyone knows those rules . "
this is not the first time that national german law has stood in the way of a fair outcome as viewed from a sporting perspective .
former gdr swimmer astrid strauss was banned for failing a doping test , but continued to race inside a reunified germany after her international ban because a judge decided it only fair .
bernhardt 's inclusion could lead to more court action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhardt can expect little support in the german team an executive board meeting will decide on july 20 if another swimmer will be pushed out of the german team by the decision forced by bernhardt 's undeserved olympic selection .
if this were to happen , bernhardt could well expect to spend more time in court than in the pool as the board 's decision would surely be the subject of a legal claim by the displaced swimmer .
if bernhardt does fly to beijing , it 's unlikely that she will be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the squad , especially those on the swimming team who will know that the third-best , and not second best , swimmer made the team and after a dirty legal challenge that went against all unwritten rules of sportsmanship .
more drama could follow if she is allowed in the squad .
olympic rules state that each country can only field two 200 meter breaststroke competitors .
with bernhardt making it three , she could cause further ill-feeling by getting the nod ahead of one of the other swimmers .
what is more likely in this scenario is that bernhardt will be forced to sit on the bench . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 .
he said it was important to show china " respect " and promote dialog with the country . " of all the european countries , germany can have the most influence in china , " the former chancellor wrote in an article for the german weekly die zeit . but that would be accomplished , he continued , through trust and cooperation , not though public denunciations of the country . " my impression is that here in germany we do not use all the possibilities we have to contribute to china 's opening and modernization , " he wrote . schroeder said the olympic games should be viewed as a chance to overcome the old " friend-enemy " paradigm and that china hoped to gain from the event international recognition of the success it 's seen thus far in its attempts at modernization . " we should pay the country respect , " he wrote . to attend or not to attend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's crackdown on pro-tibet protesters made some leaders reconsider their plans for the olympics the question of attendance of world leaders , past and present , at the opening games in beijing in august became controversial after china 's crackdown on pro-tibet demonstrators in march that caused international outrage .
there was speculation that many leaders would shun the event in protest . both german chancellor angela merkel and british prime minister gordon brown have said they will not attend the olympics opening . but french president nicolas sarkozy announced this month that he would attend the ceremony , despite an earlier threat to boycott the event . sarkozy joins us president george w. bush and japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda among those attending the opening ceremony , in an indication that leaders of the world 's richest countries see a boycott as a useless gesture .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said on july 7 that he is also " leaning toward going . " human rights ' rituals ' in the newspaper article , schroeder also criticized " rituals " regarding human rights .
he said that as chancellor , he had dispensed with " ritualized and symbolic activities that were only aimed at the german public . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder has a close relationship with russia 's putin " they might be appropriate for ngos , but for international relations and those responsible for foreign policy , they are not , " he said . he said that as chancellor , he had made it a priority to support the chinese government in its modernization process .
but , he added , not in the sense of providing instruction , but giving support for the process of building a society based on the rule of law . schroeder , who visited china six times and russia 15 times as chancellor from 1998 to 2005 , never spoke publicly about human rights . schroeder had special criticism for chancellor angela merkel 's cdu / csu bloc of german conservatives in parliament for their new strategy paper on asia which calls for a break with the current china policy .

the creators wanted to make an ironic statement about the tyrants but not everyone appreciates the joke . the game , called das fuehrer quartett , is based on a popular german children 's card game called quartett , but with a difference .
in the traditional game , the cards feature cars or flowers or even beer brands , which players try to collect from their opponents .
in this new version , the cards present pictures and information on notorious historical figures such as joseph stalin , francisco franco and adolf hitler . " we did n't really have a clear political idea in mind with the game , " said volker oppmann of onkel & onkel , the berlin-based publishing house behind the deck .
" but we did want to take away some of the power that these figures still have .
when you can laugh at them , you do n't fear them as much . " each card features one dictator , the country he ruled , his educational / vocational background and how long he was in power , among other factoids .
the cards stick to the historical record and also present information that might be less well known , oppmann , 33 , said . for example , the card featuring stalin explains that while in school he was repeatedly caught reading material that had been banned .
the card on romania 's nicolae ceausescu reveals that he had a soft spot for vlad the impaler , said to have been the inspiration for bram stoker 's " dracula . " lighter touch the cards have an ironic tone , and the authors use wordplay in some of the descriptive categories or have a lighter touch when presenting additional information about a figure .
for augusto pinochet , the card says he destroyed a democratic system with help from the us , but rebuilt another one later , only to be toppled by it .
" somehow stupid , " it says . " i think we succeeded in finding the right mix of seriousness and fun , " said oppmann . bildunterschrift : the public appears to appreciate the game 's ironic tone ; the decks have been selling fast .
of the first print run of 2,000 , oppmann said more than half are sold out and a second printing is planned . but not everyone thinks presenting war criminals as slightly risible figures is a positive thing . tasteless and inappropriate ? berlin senator ehrhart körting , 66 , called the deck tasteless .
historian arnulf baring said it played down the enormity of the crimes committed . " the further back the third reich recedes in history , the more bizarre the way it is dealt with becomes , " he told the bild newspaper . oppmann rejects the critique , pointing out that when the card game was released at this year 's leipzig book fair , employees from the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , a democratic political education organization , found the cards hilarious and ordered five decks right away . " if these people can laugh at it , i 'm not worried , " he said . in fact , the goal of das fuehrer quartett , unlike in traditional quartett , is not to gather as many cards and dictators as you can .
in this version , the winner is the first person to rid him or herself of all these despots . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

of the first print run of 2,000 , oppmann said more than half are sold out and a second printing is planned . but not everyone thinks presenting war criminals as slightly risible figures is a positive thing . tasteless and inappropriate ? berlin senator ehrhart körting , 66 , called the deck tasteless .
historian arnulf baring said it played down the enormity of the crimes committed . " the further back the third reich recedes in history , the more bizarre the way it is dealt with becomes , " he told the bild newspaper . oppmann rejects the critique , pointing out that when the card game was released at this year 's leipzig book fair , employees from the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , a democratic political education organization , found the cards hilarious and ordered five decks right away . " if these people can laugh at it , i 'm not worried , " he said . in fact , the goal of das fuehrer quartett , unlike in traditional quartett , is not to gather as many cards and dictators as you can .

" the conclusion of the conference is that there is only limited scope for reducing " emissions " in the industrial sector and the eu climate package needs improvement in key areas , " said the ministry in a statement . the ministry was particularly critical of the eu 's goal to cut the quota of emissions trading permits by 21 percent , compared to 2005 levels , saying this would cost germany both jobs and growth .
as a major burner of fossil-fuels , which cause unwanted co2 emissions , germany would be especially hard hit by the plan , added the ministry . the statement also pointed out that an emissions trading program would result in a price hike for products that are useful in reaching climate goals , such as insulation glass and insulating construction materials . no more room for cuts , says economics ministry " due to exploding oil and gas prices , further measures to achieve climate goals should be considered only with great caution , " read the statement .
" rising energy prices are already a strong incentive to investment in renewable energies , energy savings and energy efficiency . " germany 's industry has already contributed extensively to reducing greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 , despite economic growth , but has little leeway to do more , it added . earlier this month , the eu proposed a legally-binding bloc-wide initiative to slash energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
eu environment ministers have suggested the use of biofuels as a way to cut carbon emissions by 35 percent in the short-term and by 50 percent by the year 2015 . eu legislators this month also approved an emissions trading plan for the aviation industry , which airlines say will drive up the price of flights . but as long a key polluters like the united states , china and india do n't implement similar strategies to reduce emissions , the eu 's efforts wo n't have a significant impact on global climate change , concluded the economics ministry . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it calls the deal a " great success " for the un , the german government and the " excellent " german mediator himself . the paper does not name the mediator , but middle east news reports have regularly identified him as gerhard conrad , the bnd officer who was assigned to broker the previous israel-hezbollah prisoner swap in 2004 .
he is respected and trusted by both sides and by the un . the deal is expected to come to fruition on wednesday morning at rosh ha 'nikra / naquora , the only border crossing between israel and lebanon , with the handover of the bodies of two israeli soldiers , eldad regev and ehud goldwasser , who were seized in july 2006 . israelis confirmed dead according to hezbollah sources , the five lebanese prisoners set to be released have arrived at the israeli side of the border crossing .
hezbollah also said wednesday morning that the coffins of the two dead israelis had already been handed over to red cross officials at the border , confirming for the first time that the soldiers had indeed died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regev and goldwasser are ded " today we are handing to the international committee of the red cross two coffins , " senior hezbollah official wafik safa told reporters at naqoura , the lebanese side of the border .
" we are seeing that they are both dead . " red cross officials checked the coffins inside a tent on the lebanese side of the naqoura crossing after which they were taken to the israeli side of the border to be handed over to red cross delegates there . german agent conrad earlier had met with lebanese officials and then with israeli officials on each side of the border , informing them of the soldiers condition . the families of the two israeli soldiers reacted with sorrow to the news that they were dead . " many years of worry , suffering and great pain came to an end today , when unfortunately we received our sons as fallen soldiers and not as living sons , " shmulik el-grably , a spokesman for the families , told dpa news agency . he especially thanked conrad , whom he said the families had met in secret several times , for his " relentless efforts . " german mediation to continue the document notes that the negotiated swap is not the end of bnd mediation , since germany has promised israel continuing assistance in finding out what happened to other missing israeli personnel , as has already been provided for the past 15 years . however , the german program apparently does not extend to the case of gilad shilat , the israeli soldier kidnapped two years ago by the hamas movement , which controls the gaza strip , the sources said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the creators wanted to make an ironic statement about the tyrants but not everyone appreciates the joke . the game , called das fuehrer quartett , is based on a popular german children 's card game called quartett , but with a difference .
in the traditional game , the cards feature cars or flowers or even beer brands , which players try to collect from their opponents .
in this new version , the cards present pictures and information on notorious historical figures such as joseph stalin , francisco franco and adolf hitler . " we did n't really have a clear political idea in mind with the game , " said volker oppmann of onkel & onkel , the berlin-based publishing house behind the deck .
" but we did want to take away some of the power that these figures still have .
when you can laugh at them , you do n't fear them as much . " each card features one dictator , the country he ruled , his educational / vocational background and how long he was in power , among other factoids .
the cards stick to the historical record and also present information that might be less well known , oppmann , 33 , said . for example , the card featuring stalin explains that while in school he was repeatedly caught reading material that had been banned .
the card on romania 's nicolae ceausescu reveals that he had a soft spot for vlad the impaler , said to have been the inspiration for bram stoker 's " dracula . " lighter touch the cards have an ironic tone , and the authors use wordplay in some of the descriptive categories or have a lighter touch when presenting additional information about a figure .
for augusto pinochet , the card says he destroyed a democratic system with help from the us , but rebuilt another one later , only to be toppled by it .
" somehow stupid , " it says . " i think we succeeded in finding the right mix of seriousness and fun , " said oppmann . bildunterschrift : the public appears to appreciate the game 's ironic tone ; the decks have been selling fast .
of the first print run of 2,000 , oppmann said more than half are sold out and a second printing is planned . but not everyone thinks presenting war criminals as slightly risible figures is a positive thing . tasteless and inappropriate ? berlin senator ehrhart körting , 66 , called the deck tasteless .
historian arnulf baring said it played down the enormity of the crimes committed . " the further back the third reich recedes in history , the more bizarre the way it is dealt with becomes , " he told the bild newspaper . oppmann rejects the critique , pointing out that when the card game was released at this year 's leipzig book fair , employees from the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , a democratic political education organization , found the cards hilarious and ordered five decks right away . " if these people can laugh at it , i 'm not worried , " he said . in fact , the goal of das fuehrer quartett , unlike in traditional quartett , is not to gather as many cards and dictators as you can .
in this version , the winner is the first person to rid him or herself of all these despots . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it calls the deal a " great success " for the un , the german government and the " excellent " german mediator himself . the paper does not name the mediator , but middle east news reports have regularly identified him as gerhard conrad , the bnd officer who was assigned to broker the previous israel-hezbollah prisoner swap in 2004 .
he is respected and trusted by both sides and by the un . the deal is expected to come to fruition on wednesday morning at rosh ha 'nikra / naquora , the only border crossing between israel and lebanon , with the handover of the bodies of two israeli soldiers , eldad regev and ehud goldwasser , who were seized in july 2006 . israelis confirmed dead according to hezbollah sources , the five lebanese prisoners set to be released have arrived at the israeli side of the border crossing .
hezbollah also said wednesday morning that the coffins of the two dead israelis had already been handed over to red cross officials at the border , confirming for the first time that the soldiers had indeed died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regev and goldwasser are ded " today we are handing to the international committee of the red cross two coffins , " senior hezbollah official wafik safa told reporters at naqoura , the lebanese side of the border .
" we are seeing that they are both dead . " red cross officials checked the coffins inside a tent on the lebanese side of the naqoura crossing after which they were taken to the israeli side of the border to be handed over to red cross delegates there . german agent conrad earlier had met with lebanese officials and then with israeli officials on each side of the border , informing them of the soldiers condition . the families of the two israeli soldiers reacted with sorrow to the news that they were dead . " many years of worry , suffering and great pain came to an end today , when unfortunately we received our sons as fallen soldiers and not as living sons , " shmulik el-grably , a spokesman for the families , told dpa news agency . he especially thanked conrad , whom he said the families had met in secret several times , for his " relentless efforts . " german mediation to continue the document notes that the negotiated swap is not the end of bnd mediation , since germany has promised israel continuing assistance in finding out what happened to other missing israeli personnel , as has already been provided for the past 15 years . however , the german program apparently does not extend to the case of gilad shilat , the israeli soldier kidnapped two years ago by the hamas movement , which controls the gaza strip , the sources said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the conclusion of the conference is that there is only limited scope for reducing " emissions " in the industrial sector and the eu climate package needs improvement in key areas , " said the ministry in a statement . the ministry was particularly critical of the eu 's goal to cut the quota of emissions trading permits by 21 percent , compared to 2005 levels , saying this would cost germany both jobs and growth .
as a major burner of fossil-fuels , which cause unwanted co2 emissions , germany would be especially hard hit by the plan , added the ministry . the statement also pointed out that an emissions trading program would result in a price hike for products that are useful in reaching climate goals , such as insulation glass and insulating construction materials . no more room for cuts , says economics ministry " due to exploding oil and gas prices , further measures to achieve climate goals should be considered only with great caution , " read the statement .
" rising energy prices are already a strong incentive to investment in renewable energies , energy savings and energy efficiency . " germany 's industry has already contributed extensively to reducing greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 , despite economic growth , but has little leeway to do more , it added . earlier this month , the eu proposed a legally-binding bloc-wide initiative to slash energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
eu environment ministers have suggested the use of biofuels as a way to cut carbon emissions by 35 percent in the short-term and by 50 percent by the year 2015 . eu legislators this month also approved an emissions trading plan for the aviation industry , which airlines say will drive up the price of flights . but as long a key polluters like the united states , china and india do n't implement similar strategies to reduce emissions , the eu 's efforts wo n't have a significant impact on global climate change , concluded the economics ministry . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the conclusion of the conference is that there is only limited scope for reducing " emissions " in the industrial sector and the eu climate package needs improvement in key areas , " said the ministry in a statement . the ministry was particularly critical of the eu 's goal to cut the quota of emissions trading permits by 21 percent , compared to 2005 levels , saying this would cost germany both jobs and growth .
as a major burner of fossil-fuels , which cause unwanted co2 emissions , germany would be especially hard hit by the plan , added the ministry . the statement also pointed out that an emissions trading program would result in a price hike for products that are useful in reaching climate goals , such as insulation glass and insulating construction materials . no more room for cuts , says economics ministry " due to exploding oil and gas prices , further measures to achieve climate goals should be considered only with great caution , " read the statement .
" rising energy prices are already a strong incentive to investment in renewable energies , energy savings and energy efficiency . " germany 's industry has already contributed extensively to reducing greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 , despite economic growth , but has little leeway to do more , it added . earlier this month , the eu proposed a legally-binding bloc-wide initiative to slash energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
eu environment ministers have suggested the use of biofuels as a way to cut carbon emissions by 35 percent in the short-term and by 50 percent by the year 2015 . eu legislators this month also approved an emissions trading plan for the aviation industry , which airlines say will drive up the price of flights . but as long a key polluters like the united states , china and india do n't implement similar strategies to reduce emissions , the eu 's efforts wo n't have a significant impact on global climate change , concluded the economics ministry . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 16.07.2008 germany eases restrictions on skilled foreign workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are desperately scouting around for qualified people the german cabinet on wednesday made it easier for highly-skilled workers from new eu countries to fill yawning gaps in the german labor market .
but others will find it more difficult to get work visas for germany . the cabinet on wednesday , july 16 , decided to ease restrictions on highly qualified workers , effectively opening its borders to those with university or higher qualifications from 10 new eu countries from the beginning of next year . german employers will from then on no longer have to show that there are no suitably qualified applicants from germany or older eu nations in order to hire a suitable candidate from a new member country .
german businesses have long complained of a chronic lack of highly trained workers such as engineers and computer programers .
" germany must take part in an international competition to attract bright minds , " labor minister olaf scholz said .
however , restrictions on lower qualified workers from poland , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , hungary , estonia , latvia and lithuania , which joined the eu in may 2004 , remain in force until april 30 , 2011 . in the case of bulgaria and romania , which joined the bloc at the beginning of 2007 , the restrictions will be lifted only from the beginning of 2012 . the cabinet also decided to ensure an adequate supply of seasonal agricultural workers , many of whom come from eastern european countries . preference to german-learners restrictions were also eased for those foreign applicants who can show knowledge of the german language and culture by having attended german schools abroad . germany was one of many eu countries that closed its labor market to the eight eastern european countries that joined the eu in 2004 , along with cyprus and malta . the restrictions were imposed for three years and then extended for a further two years to 2009 . britain , ireland and sweden opened their labor markets immediately , and most other " old " eu members , including france , have since followed . small steps toward minimum wage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minimum wage already exists in just a few sectors in germany also on wednesday , the german cabinet agreed after extensive political debate to introduce minimum wage regulations in more sectors of the labor market .
which sectors those will be , however , has not yet been decided .
construction workers , janitors and letter carriers are already guaranteed a minimum wage under german law . the regulations are aimed at countering wage dumping and low-wage competition .
labor minister olaf scholz praised the agreement , saying that " it is a good day for many employees who work hard and earn little . " economics minister michael glos , who 'd resisted the move , said nevertheless that the government had " pushed through the most economically friendly solution .

" it was the third time this year that the three percent threshold was reached , " a destatis statement said .
the european central bank 's inflation target is just below 2.0 percent in the medium term .
food and fuel represented more than half of the annualized global price increase and corresponded to around 20 percent of all household spending , the report added .
the overall cost of fuels had leapt by 61.9 percent on the year , with motor fuels gaining 15.0 percent .
if energy was excluded , " the year-on-year rate of price increase would have been 1.9 percent , " the statement said .
food prices showing considerable gains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel prices are increasing at a dramatic rate general food prices jumped by 7.6 percent in june from the same month a year earlier , with dairy products showing a gain of 18.9 percent .
the cost of breads and cereals rose by 9.1 percent , but that of fish and seafood by just 1.2 percent .
prices for durable consumer goods fell meanwhile , with computer equipment down by 16.4 percent on the year and tv sets costing 18.9 percent less on average .
the cost of services rose by 1.6 percent , in large part owing to rents , which account for 20 percent of the total calculation , destatis said .
but it nonetheless pointed out that " the price trend for rents has remained below the level of the consumer price index for a considerable time and thus has had a dampening effect on inflation .

" you do n't care about me , " khadr tells his interrogators .
" nobody cares about me . "
indeed , when khadr complains that the interrogators have not helped his case and asks to be returned home to canada , he is told , " we ca n't do anything for you . "
the video , shot over the course of four days in february 2003 when khadr was 16 and grilled by officials from the canadian security intelligence service spy agency is the first real insight into the conditions at guantanamo bay which have been slammed by human rights activists .
" for me that video is just the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang kaleck , general secretary of the european center for constitutional and human rights . " i 'm not an emotional person , but it 's easy when you watch that footage to fill in the blanks about what you 're not seeing . "
the united states is holding about 265 prisoners at guantanamo bay . 21-year-old omar khadr , the only western national among them , is charged with killing a us medic in afghanistan in 2002 at the age of 15 .
" this tape shows the inhumanity of what goes on at guantanamo , " said ferdinand muggenthaler , americas expert at amnesty international germany .
" though the video itself does n't show torture outright , it gives us an image of what happens there - the methods that interrogators are using . "
canada in violation of un protocol ?
in one excerpt , these methods include interrogators showing little sympathy for khadr 's myriad medical concerns .
" you look like you 're doing well to me , " says the interrogator .
" i 'm not a doctor but i think you 're getting good medical care . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .
if germany was able to secure the release of their nationals , canada should be able to do the same . "
canadian prime minister stephen harper does n't seem to agree , however .
though a canadian federal judge said khadr 's treatment at guantanamo bay violated international laws on human rights , the prime minister 's office held firm tuesday in its decision not to ask for khadr 's repatriation . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" you do n't care about me , " khadr tells his interrogators .
" nobody cares about me . "
indeed , when khadr complains that the interrogators have not helped his case and asks to be returned home to canada , he is told , " we ca n't do anything for you . "
the video , shot over the course of four days in february 2003 when khadr was 16 and grilled by officials from the canadian security intelligence service spy agency is the first real insight into the conditions at guantanamo bay which have been slammed by human rights activists .
" for me that video is just the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang kaleck , general secretary of the european center for constitutional and human rights . " i 'm not an emotional person , but it 's easy when you watch that footage to fill in the blanks about what you 're not seeing . "
the united states is holding about 265 prisoners at guantanamo bay . 21-year-old omar khadr , the only western national among them , is charged with killing a us medic in afghanistan in 2002 at the age of 15 .
" this tape shows the inhumanity of what goes on at guantanamo , " said ferdinand muggenthaler , americas expert at amnesty international germany .
" though the video itself does n't show torture outright , it gives us an image of what happens there - the methods that interrogators are using . "
canada in violation of un protocol ?
in one excerpt , these methods include interrogators showing little sympathy for khadr 's myriad medical concerns .
" you look like you 're doing well to me , " says the interrogator .
" i 'm not a doctor but i think you 're getting good medical care . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .
if germany was able to secure the release of their nationals , canada should be able to do the same . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .
if germany was able to secure the release of their nationals , canada should be able to do the same . "
canadian prime minister stephen harper does n't seem to agree , however .
though a canadian federal judge said khadr 's treatment at guantanamo bay violated international laws on human rights , the prime minister 's office held firm tuesday in its decision not to ask for khadr 's repatriation . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest was french oil group total which said in a statement it was withdrawing from the country .
british-dutch group shell publicly pulled out from a gas project in iran in may .
the iranian state is no longer a shareholder in german steel manufacturer thyssen-krupp and germany 's deutsche bank ended its 40-year association with iran .
iran seeks to court german investment the economic sanctions applied against iran have sparked much criticism in the business community .
german companies are among those who feel that trade restrictions with the islamic republic are harmful not only to iran .
however , some companies continue to work with iran despite the sanctions and profit from the refusal of others to trade with tehran .
those companies which remain in business in iran do so quietly .
german engineering giant siemens continues to operate in the country but insists that its business in iran accounts for less one percent of its turnover .
europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen says it still plans to expand its assembly-line cooperation in the country but insists " there 's nothing big " in the pipeline , according to a company spokesman .
oil giant bp has vowed it will not be involved in iran and says any future engagement " will be in accordance with us sanctions . "
iran relies heavily on german companies and their know-how , because a large part of the iranian industry depends on parts supplied by germany .
such is the need for german expertise that iranian vice foreign secretary mehdi safari specifically asked for more german investment in a recent statement : " we could easily have an exchange of commodities with germany which could total more than 20 billion euros , " he said .
as way of incentive , the iranian government has loosened investment laws and has privatized state enterprises so that foreign investors can take part .
by focusing on selling its energy sector , iran hopes to attract foreign investment in its oil and gas enterprises .
while iran has the second largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world , the country , hobbled by a lack of refineries and creaking infrastructure , still has to import gasoline .

germany 's trade volume with iran totals around 3.5 billion euros , in comparison to china 's reported 30 billion dollars - an increase of 60 percent as compared to the previous year .
though the lion 's share of china 's profitable business with iran comes from its strong exports of consumer goods , some say there 's one overriding factor underpinning china 's success in the country .
" china , just like the russians , do n't take any notice of sanctions , " said daniel bernbeck , the head of the german-iranian chamber of commerce in teheran .
russia has doubled its trade with iran - much to the annoyance of european enterprises .
" if some countries abide by the restrictions of trade under the un sanctions and others do n't , then the sanction policy causes nothing but an imbalance in trade , " lamented felix neugart of the german chamber of industry and commerce .
domestic and international pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has promised hardship for those dealing with iran it 's not just the trade embargo on iran imposed by the un security council that 's hurting european businesses in iran .
the direct and indirect fallout of sanctions applied by the european union and germany are equally responsible for the plunge in profits .
for example , german companies who continue to export to iran can expect to have difficulties getting credit .
exports are also subject to such stringent controls that it 's difficult to make deliveries on time .
german companies also suffer from the fact that the accounts of the biggest iranian banks have been frozen and that german banks have exited iran .

" the money just flows via third countries and most of the transactions take place in hard cash , " said bernbeck who lives in teheran .
in such a secretive climate , the focus is on a discreet network of middlemen who literally accept suitcases with wads of money and smuggle it out of the country .

the future for trade with iran is as unstable as the international relationship with tehran .
" one should not hold on to the hope that iran will come around through sanctions alone , " said johannes reissner of the german foundation for science and politics .
a serious debate with - and about - iran must be restarted without political brinkmanship , he added .

" the money just flows via third countries and most of the transactions take place in hard cash , " said bernbeck who lives in teheran .

a serious debate with - and about - iran must be restarted without political brinkmanship , he added .
many other experts support reissner 's view that the removal of sanctions and a return to diplomatic discussion without threats would be more constructive .
bildunterschrift : face-to-face negotiations between the eu and iran failed and have yet to be restarted " it 's not like we did n't talk to iran , " said one diplomat close to the west 's negotiations who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity .
" but the carrot and stick approach did n't work .

the latest was french oil group total which said in a statement it was withdrawing from the country .
british-dutch group shell publicly pulled out from a gas project in iran in may .
the iranian state is no longer a shareholder in german steel manufacturer thyssen-krupp and germany 's deutsche bank ended its 40-year association with iran .
iran seeks to court german investment the economic sanctions applied against iran have sparked much criticism in the business community .
german companies are among those who feel that trade restrictions with the islamic republic are harmful not only to iran .
however , some companies continue to work with iran despite the sanctions and profit from the refusal of others to trade with tehran .
those companies which remain in business in iran do so quietly .
german engineering giant siemens continues to operate in the country but insists that its business in iran accounts for less one percent of its turnover .
europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen says it still plans to expand its assembly-line cooperation in the country but insists " there 's nothing big " in the pipeline , according to a company spokesman .
oil giant bp has vowed it will not be involved in iran and says any future engagement " will be in accordance with us sanctions . "
iran relies heavily on german companies and their know-how , because a large part of the iranian industry depends on parts supplied by germany .
such is the need for german expertise that iranian vice foreign secretary mehdi safari specifically asked for more german investment in a recent statement : " we could easily have an exchange of commodities with germany which could total more than 20 billion euros , " he said .
as way of incentive , the iranian government has loosened investment laws and has privatized state enterprises so that foreign investors can take part .
by focusing on selling its energy sector , iran hopes to attract foreign investment in its oil and gas enterprises .
while iran has the second largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world , the country , hobbled by a lack of refineries and creaking infrastructure , still has to import gasoline .

germany 's trade volume with iran totals around 3.5 billion euros , in comparison to china 's reported 30 billion dollars - an increase of 60 percent as compared to the previous year .
though the lion 's share of china 's profitable business with iran comes from its strong exports of consumer goods , some say there 's one overriding factor underpinning china 's success in the country .
" china , just like the russians , do n't take any notice of sanctions , " said daniel bernbeck , the head of the german-iranian chamber of commerce in teheran .
russia has doubled its trade with iran - much to the annoyance of european enterprises .
" if some countries abide by the restrictions of trade under the un sanctions and others do n't , then the sanction policy causes nothing but an imbalance in trade , " lamented felix neugart of the german chamber of industry and commerce .
domestic and international pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has promised hardship for those dealing with iran it 's not just the trade embargo on iran imposed by the un security council that 's hurting european businesses in iran .
the direct and indirect fallout of sanctions applied by the european union and germany are equally responsible for the plunge in profits .
for example , german companies who continue to export to iran can expect to have difficulties getting credit .
exports are also subject to such stringent controls that it 's difficult to make deliveries on time .
german companies also suffer from the fact that the accounts of the biggest iranian banks have been frozen and that german banks have exited iran .

at present , saudi arabia is a favorite trading partner of the iranians .
the gulf nation has offered russia wide-ranging arms deals if in return moscow deepens cooperation with iran .
the future for trade with iran is as unstable as the international relationship with tehran .
" one should not hold on to the hope that iran will come around through sanctions alone , " said johannes reissner of the german foundation for science and politics .
a serious debate with - and about - iran must be restarted without political brinkmanship , he added .
many other experts support reissner 's view that the removal of sanctions and a return to diplomatic discussion without threats would be more constructive .
bildunterschrift : face-to-face negotiations between the eu and iran failed and have yet to be restarted " it 's not like we did n't talk to iran , " said one diplomat close to the west 's negotiations who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity .
" but the carrot and stick approach did n't work .
now we 've worked on both levels , " he said , referring to offering iran a repreive from economic and financial sanctions in exchange for freezing its enrichment activites .
while the rhetoric increases , the hidden trade with iran still blossoms .
the industrial parts , which germany refuses to deliver , now come from england .
asia is also scrambling to catch up with the west by exporting industrial know-how .
us trade increases as washington pressures others and the us is n't far behind .
us exports to iran have hugely increased during the bush administration 's two terms , showing stronger growth than under any other us government .
us goods to the value of $ 150 million were shipped into iran in 2007 alone .
all of which rankles with european investors who feel the pressure not to deal with tehran emanating from washington .
meanwhile , german companies continue to bail out of iran .
even a german manufacturer of faucets for bathtubs has discontinued his long-standing relationship with an iranian customer - because of the fear that the us could find out that he trades with iran .
this is absurd , criticizes daniel bernbeck .

" the conclusion of the conference is that there is only limited scope for reducing " emissions " in the industrial sector and the eu climate package needs improvement in key areas , " said the ministry in a statement . the ministry was particularly critical of the eu 's goal to cut the quota of emissions trading permits by 21 percent , compared to 2005 levels , saying this would cost germany both jobs and growth .
as a major burner of fossil-fuels , which cause unwanted co2 emissions , germany would be especially hard hit by the plan , added the ministry . the statement also pointed out that an emissions trading program would result in a price hike for products that are useful in reaching climate goals , such as insulation glass and insulating construction materials . no more room for cuts , says economics ministry " due to exploding oil and gas prices , further measures to achieve climate goals should be considered only with great caution , " read the statement .

eu environment ministers have suggested the use of biofuels as a way to cut carbon emissions by 35 percent in the short-term and by 50 percent by the year 2015 . eu legislators this month also approved an emissions trading plan for the aviation industry , which airlines say will drive up the price of flights . but as long a key polluters like the united states , china and india do n't implement similar strategies to reduce emissions , the eu 's efforts wo n't have a significant impact on global climate change , concluded the economics ministry . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 16.07.2008 european rights activists slam guantanamo bay conditions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the video of the guantanamo inmate begging for help has sparked outrage european human rights activists have expressed alarm about a graphic video released this week showing a young canadian inmate at guantanamo bay weeping and calling out for help . a grainy seven-and-a-half hour video released by the lawyers of the youngest detainee held at the us military prison in cuba shows omar khadr weeping and begging for help .
" you do n't care about me , " khadr tells his interrogators .
" nobody cares about me . "
indeed , when khadr complains that the interrogators have not helped his case and asks to be returned home to canada , he is told , " we ca n't do anything for you . "
the video , shot over the course of four days in february 2003 when khadr was 16 and grilled by officials from the canadian security intelligence service spy agency is the first real insight into the conditions at guantanamo bay which have been slammed by human rights activists .
" for me that video is just the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang kaleck , general secretary of the european center for constitutional and human rights . " i 'm not an emotional person , but it 's easy when you watch that footage to fill in the blanks about what you 're not seeing . "
the united states is holding about 265 prisoners at guantanamo bay . 21-year-old omar khadr , the only western national among them , is charged with killing a us medic in afghanistan in 2002 at the age of 15 .
" this tape shows the inhumanity of what goes on at guantanamo , " said ferdinand muggenthaler , americas expert at amnesty international germany .
" though the video itself does n't show torture outright , it gives us an image of what happens there - the methods that interrogators are using . "
canada in violation of un protocol ?
in one excerpt , these methods include interrogators showing little sympathy for khadr 's myriad medical concerns .
" you look like you 're doing well to me , " says the interrogator .
" i 'm not a doctor but i think you 're getting good medical care . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .
if germany was able to secure the release of their nationals , canada should be able to do the same . "
canadian prime minister stephen harper does n't seem to agree , however .
though a canadian federal judge said khadr 's treatment at guantanamo bay violated international laws on human rights , the prime minister 's office held firm tuesday in its decision not to ask for khadr 's repatriation . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" you do n't care about me , " khadr tells his interrogators .
" nobody cares about me . "
indeed , when khadr complains that the interrogators have not helped his case and asks to be returned home to canada , he is told , " we ca n't do anything for you . "
the video , shot over the course of four days in february 2003 when khadr was 16 and grilled by officials from the canadian security intelligence service spy agency is the first real insight into the conditions at guantanamo bay which have been slammed by human rights activists .
" for me that video is just the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang kaleck , general secretary of the european center for constitutional and human rights . " i 'm not an emotional person , but it 's easy when you watch that footage to fill in the blanks about what you 're not seeing . "
the united states is holding about 265 prisoners at guantanamo bay . 21-year-old omar khadr , the only western national among them , is charged with killing a us medic in afghanistan in 2002 at the age of 15 .
" this tape shows the inhumanity of what goes on at guantanamo , " said ferdinand muggenthaler , americas expert at amnesty international germany .
" though the video itself does n't show torture outright , it gives us an image of what happens there - the methods that interrogators are using . "
canada in violation of un protocol ?
in one excerpt , these methods include interrogators showing little sympathy for khadr 's myriad medical concerns .
" you look like you 're doing well to me , " says the interrogator .
" i 'm not a doctor but i think you 're getting good medical care . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .
if germany was able to secure the release of their nationals , canada should be able to do the same . "
canadian prime minister stephen harper does n't seem to agree , however .
though a canadian federal judge said khadr 's treatment at guantanamo bay violated international laws on human rights , the prime minister 's office held firm tuesday in its decision not to ask for khadr 's repatriation . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it calls the deal a " great success " for the un , the german government and the " excellent " german mediator himself . the paper does not name the mediator , but middle east news reports have regularly identified him as gerhard conrad , the bnd officer who was assigned to broker the previous israel-hezbollah prisoner swap in 2004 .
he is respected and trusted by both sides and by the un . the deal is expected to come to fruition on wednesday morning at rosh ha 'nikra / naquora , the only border crossing between israel and lebanon , with the handover of the bodies of two israeli soldiers , eldad regev and ehud goldwasser , who were seized in july 2006 . israelis confirmed dead according to hezbollah sources , the five lebanese prisoners set to be released have arrived at the israeli side of the border crossing .
hezbollah also said wednesday morning that the coffins of the two dead israelis had already been handed over to red cross officials at the border , confirming for the first time that the soldiers had indeed died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regev and goldwasser are ded " today we are handing to the international committee of the red cross two coffins , " senior hezbollah official wafik safa told reporters at naqoura , the lebanese side of the border .
" we are seeing that they are both dead . " red cross officials checked the coffins inside a tent on the lebanese side of the naqoura crossing after which they were taken to the israeli side of the border to be handed over to red cross delegates there . german agent conrad earlier had met with lebanese officials and then with israeli officials on each side of the border , informing them of the soldiers condition . the families of the two israeli soldiers reacted with sorrow to the news that they were dead . " many years of worry , suffering and great pain came to an end today , when unfortunately we received our sons as fallen soldiers and not as living sons , " shmulik el-grably , a spokesman for the families , told dpa news agency . he especially thanked conrad , whom he said the families had met in secret several times , for his " relentless efforts . " german mediation to continue the document notes that the negotiated swap is not the end of bnd mediation , since germany has promised israel continuing assistance in finding out what happened to other missing israeli personnel , as has already been provided for the past 15 years . however , the german program apparently does not extend to the case of gilad shilat , the israeli soldier kidnapped two years ago by the hamas movement , which controls the gaza strip , the sources said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 16.07.2008 german companies feel the pain in sanctions-hit iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german industrial know-how is needed by iran but is being denied through sanctions german companies , especially hard hit by trade and economic sanctions against iran , are worried they are losing lucrative contracts in the oil-rich region to countries such as china and russia . reeling under the fallout of trade sanctions and international pressure to cut ties with a oil-rich nation that the west suspects of covertly enriching uranium to build nuclear weapons , many large european companies have either completely pulled out of iran or have put the brakes on business expansion in the country .
the latest was french oil group total which said in a statement it was withdrawing from the country .
british-dutch group shell publicly pulled out from a gas project in iran in may .
the iranian state is no longer a shareholder in german steel manufacturer thyssen-krupp and germany 's deutsche bank ended its 40-year association with iran .
iran seeks to court german investment the economic sanctions applied against iran have sparked much criticism in the business community .
german companies are among those who feel that trade restrictions with the islamic republic are harmful not only to iran .
however , some companies continue to work with iran despite the sanctions and profit from the refusal of others to trade with tehran .
those companies which remain in business in iran do so quietly .
german engineering giant siemens continues to operate in the country but insists that its business in iran accounts for less one percent of its turnover .
europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen says it still plans to expand its assembly-line cooperation in the country but insists " there 's nothing big " in the pipeline , according to a company spokesman .
oil giant bp has vowed it will not be involved in iran and says any future engagement " will be in accordance with us sanctions . "
iran relies heavily on german companies and their know-how , because a large part of the iranian industry depends on parts supplied by germany .
such is the need for german expertise that iranian vice foreign secretary mehdi safari specifically asked for more german investment in a recent statement : " we could easily have an exchange of commodities with germany which could total more than 20 billion euros , " he said .
as way of incentive , the iranian government has loosened investment laws and has privatized state enterprises so that foreign investors can take part .
by focusing on selling its energy sector , iran hopes to attract foreign investment in its oil and gas enterprises .
while iran has the second largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world , the country , hobbled by a lack of refineries and creaking infrastructure , still has to import gasoline .
china , russia picking up the slack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has stepped in to provide the goods germany wo n't while german investment in iran dropped by around 15 percent in the last year , china 's investments in the country are booming .
germany 's trade volume with iran totals around 3.5 billion euros , in comparison to china 's reported 30 billion dollars - an increase of 60 percent as compared to the previous year .
though the lion 's share of china 's profitable business with iran comes from its strong exports of consumer goods , some say there 's one overriding factor underpinning china 's success in the country .
" china , just like the russians , do n't take any notice of sanctions , " said daniel bernbeck , the head of the german-iranian chamber of commerce in teheran .
russia has doubled its trade with iran - much to the annoyance of european enterprises .
" if some countries abide by the restrictions of trade under the un sanctions and others do n't , then the sanction policy causes nothing but an imbalance in trade , " lamented felix neugart of the german chamber of industry and commerce .
domestic and international pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has promised hardship for those dealing with iran it 's not just the trade embargo on iran imposed by the un security council that 's hurting european businesses in iran .
the direct and indirect fallout of sanctions applied by the european union and germany are equally responsible for the plunge in profits .
for example , german companies who continue to export to iran can expect to have difficulties getting credit .
exports are also subject to such stringent controls that it 's difficult to make deliveries on time .
german companies also suffer from the fact that the accounts of the biggest iranian banks have been frozen and that german banks have exited iran .
there is also the question of which market is more important : iran or the united states ?
pursuing or maintaining trade links with iran runs the risk of angering the us , which has taken the lead in pressurizing european firms to sever trade links with iran .
european companies that continue to trade with iran can expect a hard time in the united states .
sidestepping sanctions still , experts say trade with iran is n't entirely impossible and some european companies do find a way to dodge un sanctions .
" the money just flows via third countries and most of the transactions take place in hard cash , " said bernbeck who lives in teheran .
in such a secretive climate , the focus is on a discreet network of middlemen who literally accept suitcases with wads of money and smuggle it out of the country .
" they 're medieval methods of doing business , " said bernbeck , who said he withdrew money from his bank in germany to pay his yearly rent in cash to his landlady in teheran , usually in cash in a bar .
" if a plane crashes on its way to tehran from germany , then the loss of the luggage would be more expensive than the loss of the plane , " he said .
change in political approach would help trade business federations describe the current policy towards iran as " paranoia combined with hysteria . "
though german exports to iran rose slightly this year , experts say in the long-run there will be a major shift in iran 's trading partners as the country looks for other investors and business players .
" germany certainly stands to lose in such a situation , " said henner fuertig of the leibniz institute for global and regional studies .
at present , saudi arabia is a favorite trading partner of the iranians .
the gulf nation has offered russia wide-ranging arms deals if in return moscow deepens cooperation with iran .
the future for trade with iran is as unstable as the international relationship with tehran .
" one should not hold on to the hope that iran will come around through sanctions alone , " said johannes reissner of the german foundation for science and politics .
a serious debate with - and about - iran must be restarted without political brinkmanship , he added .
many other experts support reissner 's view that the removal of sanctions and a return to diplomatic discussion without threats would be more constructive .
bildunterschrift : face-to-face negotiations between the eu and iran failed and have yet to be restarted " it 's not like we did n't talk to iran , " said one diplomat close to the west 's negotiations who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity .
" but the carrot and stick approach did n't work .
now we 've worked on both levels , " he said , referring to offering iran a repreive from economic and financial sanctions in exchange for freezing its enrichment activites .
while the rhetoric increases , the hidden trade with iran still blossoms .
the industrial parts , which germany refuses to deliver , now come from england .
asia is also scrambling to catch up with the west by exporting industrial know-how .
us trade increases as washington pressures others and the us is n't far behind .
us exports to iran have hugely increased during the bush administration 's two terms , showing stronger growth than under any other us government .
us goods to the value of $ 150 million were shipped into iran in 2007 alone .
all of which rankles with european investors who feel the pressure not to deal with tehran emanating from washington .
meanwhile , german companies continue to bail out of iran .
even a german manufacturer of faucets for bathtubs has discontinued his long-standing relationship with an iranian customer - because of the fear that the us could find out that he trades with iran .
this is absurd , criticizes daniel bernbeck .

europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen says it still plans to expand its assembly-line cooperation in the country but insists " there 's nothing big " in the pipeline , according to a company spokesman .
oil giant bp has vowed it will not be involved in iran and says any future engagement " will be in accordance with us sanctions . "
iran relies heavily on german companies and their know-how , because a large part of the iranian industry depends on parts supplied by germany .
such is the need for german expertise that iranian vice foreign secretary mehdi safari specifically asked for more german investment in a recent statement : " we could easily have an exchange of commodities with germany which could total more than 20 billion euros , " he said .
as way of incentive , the iranian government has loosened investment laws and has privatized state enterprises so that foreign investors can take part .
by focusing on selling its energy sector , iran hopes to attract foreign investment in its oil and gas enterprises .
while iran has the second largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world , the country , hobbled by a lack of refineries and creaking infrastructure , still has to import gasoline .
china , russia picking up the slack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has stepped in to provide the goods germany wo n't while german investment in iran dropped by around 15 percent in the last year , china 's investments in the country are booming .
germany 's trade volume with iran totals around 3.5 billion euros , in comparison to china 's reported 30 billion dollars - an increase of 60 percent as compared to the previous year .
though the lion 's share of china 's profitable business with iran comes from its strong exports of consumer goods , some say there 's one overriding factor underpinning china 's success in the country .
" china , just like the russians , do n't take any notice of sanctions , " said daniel bernbeck , the head of the german-iranian chamber of commerce in teheran .
russia has doubled its trade with iran - much to the annoyance of european enterprises .
" if some countries abide by the restrictions of trade under the un sanctions and others do n't , then the sanction policy causes nothing but an imbalance in trade , " lamented felix neugart of the german chamber of industry and commerce .
domestic and international pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has promised hardship for those dealing with iran it 's not just the trade embargo on iran imposed by the un security council that 's hurting european businesses in iran .
the direct and indirect fallout of sanctions applied by the european union and germany are equally responsible for the plunge in profits .
for example , german companies who continue to export to iran can expect to have difficulties getting credit .
exports are also subject to such stringent controls that it 's difficult to make deliveries on time .
german companies also suffer from the fact that the accounts of the biggest iranian banks have been frozen and that german banks have exited iran .
there is also the question of which market is more important : iran or the united states ?
pursuing or maintaining trade links with iran runs the risk of angering the us , which has taken the lead in pressurizing european firms to sever trade links with iran .
european companies that continue to trade with iran can expect a hard time in the united states .
sidestepping sanctions still , experts say trade with iran is n't entirely impossible and some european companies do find a way to dodge un sanctions .
" the money just flows via third countries and most of the transactions take place in hard cash , " said bernbeck who lives in teheran .
in such a secretive climate , the focus is on a discreet network of middlemen who literally accept suitcases with wads of money and smuggle it out of the country .
" they 're medieval methods of doing business , " said bernbeck , who said he withdrew money from his bank in germany to pay his yearly rent in cash to his landlady in teheran , usually in cash in a bar .
" if a plane crashes on its way to tehran from germany , then the loss of the luggage would be more expensive than the loss of the plane , " he said .
change in political approach would help trade business federations describe the current policy towards iran as " paranoia combined with hysteria . "
though german exports to iran rose slightly this year , experts say in the long-run there will be a major shift in iran 's trading partners as the country looks for other investors and business players .
" germany certainly stands to lose in such a situation , " said henner fuertig of the leibniz institute for global and regional studies .
at present , saudi arabia is a favorite trading partner of the iranians .
the gulf nation has offered russia wide-ranging arms deals if in return moscow deepens cooperation with iran .
the future for trade with iran is as unstable as the international relationship with tehran .
" one should not hold on to the hope that iran will come around through sanctions alone , " said johannes reissner of the german foundation for science and politics .
a serious debate with - and about - iran must be restarted without political brinkmanship , he added .
many other experts support reissner 's view that the removal of sanctions and a return to diplomatic discussion without threats would be more constructive .
bildunterschrift : face-to-face negotiations between the eu and iran failed and have yet to be restarted " it 's not like we did n't talk to iran , " said one diplomat close to the west 's negotiations who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity .
" but the carrot and stick approach did n't work .
now we 've worked on both levels , " he said , referring to offering iran a repreive from economic and financial sanctions in exchange for freezing its enrichment activites .

us exports to iran have hugely increased during the bush administration 's two terms , showing stronger growth than under any other us government .

all of which rankles with european investors who feel the pressure not to deal with tehran emanating from washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 16.07.2008 volkswagen to set up $ 1 billion car plant in us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's largest carmaker is stepping on the gas in the us market volkswagen , europe 's biggest car maker , has said it plans to build a 620 million euros -lrb- $ 1billion -rrb- factory in chattanooga , tennessee in a bid to boost the german automaker 's lagging us sales . the site , one of at least two in the us south that volkswagen examined , was picked by volkswagen group 's supervisory board .
the plan calls for the first cars to roll off the assembly line in 2011 . europe 's biggest carmaker has failed for years to achieve profits in the united states , where asian competitors have regularly upstaged its range of mass-produced front-wheel drive cars .
" the united states is an important market for our volume strategy , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying .
" volkswagen will be extremely active there , " he pledged , the same day that us giant general motors warned of " significant " second quarter losses and unveiled a fresh restructuring and cost-cutting program to battle slumping sales .
" we will be selling 800,000 volkswagens per year in the us by 2018 , and this new site will play a key role , " winterkorn forecast .
vw had been searching for the location of an assembly line to protect it from a relentless rise of the euro that has affected profits in north america .
making cars in the eurozone and selling them for dollars has cost european automakers dearly .
" this , along with our growth strategy , is a pre-requisite for the economic success of the company in the dollar region , " winterkorn added .
earlier tuesday , the single european currency set a new record above $ 1.60 as the greenback was hit by mounting fears over the stormy us economic outlook , dealers said .
vw to employ 2,000 local workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw will continue its policy of hiring a local workforce the vw statement added that the automaker also wanted us customers to perceive it as a domestic manufacturer .
vw said it would hire around 2,000 workers to work at the chattanooga plant .
the german auto giant already has a plant in mexico but it does not make enough cars to supply all of north america , where vw currently has a market share of around two percent .
the group wants to at least triple that figure within 10 years and said tuesday it would produce a new midsized sedan " tailored specifically to the us market " at the new plant .
vw has already begun to restructure activities in the united states , which have posted losses for several years .
in addition to vehicle production , distribution and marketing activities are covered by the measures .
general motors forecast significant losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes have hit general motors ' productivity this year in chicago , gm said that strikes , a soft market and an " adverse vehicle segment mix " would result in a significant second-quarter loss .
those losses would be deepened as a result of " significant charges " gm expected to report related to a massive restructuring program of its own initiated in 2005 .
gm has already cut its us workforce by more that 40,000 employees as it shuttered plants in the wake of losses which have topped $ 54 billion since 2005 .
investors welcomed the news and shares in the german group closed on tuesday with a gain of 2.34 percent at 174.23 euros .
the dax index of leading shares was off by 1.91 percent overall at 6,081.70 points , the first time it had fallen below 6,100 points since october 2006 .
other german carmakers to join in volkswagen is not the only german company to increase its production output in the united states .
by 2012 , luxury automaker bmw plans to invest a billion dollars in its distribution network and its plant in south carolina will increase output by 50 percent to 240,000 vehicles per year , news agency afp reported .
stuttgart-based daimler already has several factories in the united states , in particular for heavy trucks , and its car plant in alabama rolls out around 180,000 units a year .
in all , german companies have a us market share of around six percent with more than 900,000 units sold per year , of which only around one quarter are built on the continent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan calls for the first cars to roll off the assembly line in 2011 . europe 's biggest carmaker has failed for years to achieve profits in the united states , where asian competitors have regularly upstaged its range of mass-produced front-wheel drive cars .
" the united states is an important market for our volume strategy , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying .
" volkswagen will be extremely active there , " he pledged , the same day that us giant general motors warned of " significant " second quarter losses and unveiled a fresh restructuring and cost-cutting program to battle slumping sales .
" we will be selling 800,000 volkswagens per year in the us by 2018 , and this new site will play a key role , " winterkorn forecast .
vw had been searching for the location of an assembly line to protect it from a relentless rise of the euro that has affected profits in north america .
making cars in the eurozone and selling them for dollars has cost european automakers dearly .
" this , along with our growth strategy , is a pre-requisite for the economic success of the company in the dollar region , " winterkorn added .
earlier tuesday , the single european currency set a new record above $ 1.60 as the greenback was hit by mounting fears over the stormy us economic outlook , dealers said .

vw said it would hire around 2,000 workers to work at the chattanooga plant .
the german auto giant already has a plant in mexico but it does not make enough cars to supply all of north america , where vw currently has a market share of around two percent .
the group wants to at least triple that figure within 10 years and said tuesday it would produce a new midsized sedan " tailored specifically to the us market " at the new plant .
vw has already begun to restructure activities in the united states , which have posted losses for several years .
in addition to vehicle production , distribution and marketing activities are covered by the measures .
general motors forecast significant losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes have hit general motors ' productivity this year in chicago , gm said that strikes , a soft market and an " adverse vehicle segment mix " would result in a significant second-quarter loss .
those losses would be deepened as a result of " significant charges " gm expected to report related to a massive restructuring program of its own initiated in 2005 .
gm has already cut its us workforce by more that 40,000 employees as it shuttered plants in the wake of losses which have topped $ 54 billion since 2005 .
investors welcomed the news and shares in the german group closed on tuesday with a gain of 2.34 percent at 174.23 euros .

stuttgart-based daimler already has several factories in the united states , in particular for heavy trucks , and its car plant in alabama rolls out around 180,000 units a year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 16.07.2008 european rights activists slam guantanamo bay conditions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the video of the guantanamo inmate begging for help has sparked outrage european human rights activists have expressed alarm about a graphic video released this week showing a young canadian inmate at guantanamo bay weeping and calling out for help . a grainy seven-and-a-half hour video released by the lawyers of the youngest detainee held at the us military prison in cuba shows omar khadr weeping and begging for help .
" you do n't care about me , " khadr tells his interrogators .
" nobody cares about me . "
indeed , when khadr complains that the interrogators have not helped his case and asks to be returned home to canada , he is told , " we ca n't do anything for you . "
the video , shot over the course of four days in february 2003 when khadr was 16 and grilled by officials from the canadian security intelligence service spy agency is the first real insight into the conditions at guantanamo bay which have been slammed by human rights activists .
" for me that video is just the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang kaleck , general secretary of the european center for constitutional and human rights . " i 'm not an emotional person , but it 's easy when you watch that footage to fill in the blanks about what you 're not seeing . "
the united states is holding about 265 prisoners at guantanamo bay . 21-year-old omar khadr , the only western national among them , is charged with killing a us medic in afghanistan in 2002 at the age of 15 .
" this tape shows the inhumanity of what goes on at guantanamo , " said ferdinand muggenthaler , americas expert at amnesty international germany .
" though the video itself does n't show torture outright , it gives us an image of what happens there - the methods that interrogators are using . "
canada in violation of un protocol ?
in one excerpt , these methods include interrogators showing little sympathy for khadr 's myriad medical concerns .
" you look like you 're doing well to me , " says the interrogator .
" i 'm not a doctor but i think you 're getting good medical care . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .
if germany was able to secure the release of their nationals , canada should be able to do the same . "
canadian prime minister stephen harper does n't seem to agree , however .
though a canadian federal judge said khadr 's treatment at guantanamo bay violated international laws on human rights , the prime minister 's office held firm tuesday in its decision not to ask for khadr 's repatriation . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 16.07.2008 european rights activists slam guantanamo bay conditions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the video of the guantanamo inmate begging for help has sparked outrage european human rights activists have expressed alarm about a graphic video released this week showing a young canadian inmate at guantanamo bay weeping and calling out for help . a grainy seven-and-a-half hour video released by the lawyers of the youngest detainee held at the us military prison in cuba shows omar khadr weeping and begging for help .
" you do n't care about me , " khadr tells his interrogators .
" nobody cares about me . "
indeed , when khadr complains that the interrogators have not helped his case and asks to be returned home to canada , he is told , " we ca n't do anything for you . "
the video , shot over the course of four days in february 2003 when khadr was 16 and grilled by officials from the canadian security intelligence service spy agency is the first real insight into the conditions at guantanamo bay which have been slammed by human rights activists .
" for me that video is just the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang kaleck , general secretary of the european center for constitutional and human rights . " i 'm not an emotional person , but it 's easy when you watch that footage to fill in the blanks about what you 're not seeing . "
the united states is holding about 265 prisoners at guantanamo bay . 21-year-old omar khadr , the only western national among them , is charged with killing a us medic in afghanistan in 2002 at the age of 15 .
" this tape shows the inhumanity of what goes on at guantanamo , " said ferdinand muggenthaler , americas expert at amnesty international germany .
" though the video itself does n't show torture outright , it gives us an image of what happens there - the methods that interrogators are using . "
canada in violation of un protocol ?
in one excerpt , these methods include interrogators showing little sympathy for khadr 's myriad medical concerns .
" you look like you 're doing well to me , " says the interrogator .
" i 'm not a doctor but i think you 're getting good medical care . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .
if germany was able to secure the release of their nationals , canada should be able to do the same . "
canadian prime minister stephen harper does n't seem to agree , however .
though a canadian federal judge said khadr 's treatment at guantanamo bay violated international laws on human rights , the prime minister 's office held firm tuesday in its decision not to ask for khadr 's repatriation . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court injunction , heard by the state court in kassel late on monday , forced the german national olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- to scratch poleska - who finished second in the qualifying trial - in favor of third-placed bernhardt , much to the chagrin of dosb president thomas bach .
bernhardt finished third in the 200 meters breaststroke at the german national championships in april , just failing to get a top two spot needed to make the team for beijing .
rather than graciously facing the fact that she had come up just short , bernhardt ruthlessly exposed a footnote law within the rules of the german championships to force the hand of the dosb .
rival poleska accused of breaking club rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poleska says she did n't race as a club member in the us the court in kessel heard that poleska - a born-and-bred german , a national champion and olympic bronze medalist from athens 2004 - had previously raced for the coral springs swimming club in florida and not a german club .
german swimming federation rules allow athletes to compete for foreign college or school swimming teams but not foreign clubs .
" i 've never seen anything like this before - an athlete trying to box her way onto the team because of a technicality , a mistake by a colleague , " bach told reporters .
poleska said she had done nothing wrong and was not a member of any club when she swam in the florida meets .
" i see my position as crystal clear from a legal point of view , " she said .
" i 'm not afraid at all that i 'll miss the olympics . "
germany 's olympic swimming coach orjan madsen was also sure that poleska and not bernhardt would be representing germany in beijing .
" ' the fact is that anne was nominated by the dosb and already has her olympic team clothes that she 'll be traveling to beijing in , " he said .
michael wolski , a lawyer and chairman of bernhardt 's club sg frankfurt which filed the legal challenge on her behalf , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung he had presented documents showing poleska took part in 10 club meets for coral springs .
" i can not imagine she did not know the rules , " wolski was quoted by the paper as saying .
" everyone knows those rules . "
this is not the first time that national german law has stood in the way of a fair outcome as viewed from a sporting perspective .
former gdr swimmer astrid strauss was banned for failing a doping test , but continued to race inside a reunified germany after her international ban because a judge decided it only fair .
bernhardt 's inclusion could lead to more court action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhardt can expect little support in the german team an executive board meeting will decide on july 20 if another swimmer will be pushed out of the german team by the decision forced by bernhardt 's undeserved olympic selection .
if this were to happen , bernhardt could well expect to spend more time in court than in the pool as the board 's decision would surely be the subject of a legal claim by the displaced swimmer .
if bernhardt does fly to beijing , it 's unlikely that she will be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the squad , especially those on the swimming team who will know that the third-best , and not second best , swimmer made the team and after a dirty legal challenge that went against all unwritten rules of sportsmanship .
more drama could follow if she is allowed in the squad .
olympic rules state that each country can only field two 200 meter breaststroke competitors .
with bernhardt making it three , she could cause further ill-feeling by getting the nod ahead of one of the other swimmers .
what is more likely in this scenario is that bernhardt will be forced to sit on the bench . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court injunction , heard by the state court in kassel late on monday , forced the german national olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- to scratch poleska - who finished second in the qualifying trial - in favor of third-placed bernhardt , much to the chagrin of dosb president thomas bach .
bernhardt finished third in the 200 meters breaststroke at the german national championships in april , just failing to get a top two spot needed to make the team for beijing .
rather than graciously facing the fact that she had come up just short , bernhardt ruthlessly exposed a footnote law within the rules of the german championships to force the hand of the dosb .
rival poleska accused of breaking club rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poleska says she did n't race as a club member in the us the court in kessel heard that poleska - a born-and-bred german , a national champion and olympic bronze medalist from athens 2004 - had previously raced for the coral springs swimming club in florida and not a german club .
german swimming federation rules allow athletes to compete for foreign college or school swimming teams but not foreign clubs .
" i 've never seen anything like this before - an athlete trying to box her way onto the team because of a technicality , a mistake by a colleague , " bach told reporters .
poleska said she had done nothing wrong and was not a member of any club when she swam in the florida meets .
" i see my position as crystal clear from a legal point of view , " she said .
" i 'm not afraid at all that i 'll miss the olympics . "
germany 's olympic swimming coach orjan madsen was also sure that poleska and not bernhardt would be representing germany in beijing .
" ' the fact is that anne was nominated by the dosb and already has her olympic team clothes that she 'll be traveling to beijing in , " he said .
michael wolski , a lawyer and chairman of bernhardt 's club sg frankfurt which filed the legal challenge on her behalf , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung he had presented documents showing poleska took part in 10 club meets for coral springs .
" i can not imagine she did not know the rules , " wolski was quoted by the paper as saying .
" everyone knows those rules . "
this is not the first time that national german law has stood in the way of a fair outcome as viewed from a sporting perspective .
former gdr swimmer astrid strauss was banned for failing a doping test , but continued to race inside a reunified germany after her international ban because a judge decided it only fair .
bernhardt 's inclusion could lead to more court action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhardt can expect little support in the german team an executive board meeting will decide on july 20 if another swimmer will be pushed out of the german team by the decision forced by bernhardt 's undeserved olympic selection .
if this were to happen , bernhardt could well expect to spend more time in court than in the pool as the board 's decision would surely be the subject of a legal claim by the displaced swimmer .
if bernhardt does fly to beijing , it 's unlikely that she will be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the squad , especially those on the swimming team who will know that the third-best , and not second best , swimmer made the team and after a dirty legal challenge that went against all unwritten rules of sportsmanship .
more drama could follow if she is allowed in the squad .
olympic rules state that each country can only field two 200 meter breaststroke competitors .
with bernhardt making it three , she could cause further ill-feeling by getting the nod ahead of one of the other swimmers .
what is more likely in this scenario is that bernhardt will be forced to sit on the bench . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the creators wanted to make an ironic statement about the tyrants but not everyone appreciates the joke . the game , called das fuehrer quartett , is based on a popular german children 's card game called quartett , but with a difference .
in the traditional game , the cards feature cars or flowers or even beer brands , which players try to collect from their opponents .
in this new version , the cards present pictures and information on notorious historical figures such as joseph stalin , francisco franco and adolf hitler . " we did n't really have a clear political idea in mind with the game , " said volker oppmann of onkel & onkel , the berlin-based publishing house behind the deck .
" but we did want to take away some of the power that these figures still have .
when you can laugh at them , you do n't fear them as much . " each card features one dictator , the country he ruled , his educational / vocational background and how long he was in power , among other factoids .
the cards stick to the historical record and also present information that might be less well known , oppmann , 33 , said . for example , the card featuring stalin explains that while in school he was repeatedly caught reading material that had been banned .
the card on romania 's nicolae ceausescu reveals that he had a soft spot for vlad the impaler , said to have been the inspiration for bram stoker 's " dracula . " lighter touch the cards have an ironic tone , and the authors use wordplay in some of the descriptive categories or have a lighter touch when presenting additional information about a figure .
for augusto pinochet , the card says he destroyed a democratic system with help from the us , but rebuilt another one later , only to be toppled by it .
" somehow stupid , " it says . " i think we succeeded in finding the right mix of seriousness and fun , " said oppmann . bildunterschrift : the public appears to appreciate the game 's ironic tone ; the decks have been selling fast .
of the first print run of 2,000 , oppmann said more than half are sold out and a second printing is planned . but not everyone thinks presenting war criminals as slightly risible figures is a positive thing . tasteless and inappropriate ? berlin senator ehrhart körting , 66 , called the deck tasteless .
historian arnulf baring said it played down the enormity of the crimes committed . " the further back the third reich recedes in history , the more bizarre the way it is dealt with becomes , " he told the bild newspaper . oppmann rejects the critique , pointing out that when the card game was released at this year 's leipzig book fair , employees from the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , a democratic political education organization , found the cards hilarious and ordered five decks right away . " if these people can laugh at it , i 'm not worried , " he said . in fact , the goal of das fuehrer quartett , unlike in traditional quartett , is not to gather as many cards and dictators as you can .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 16.07.2008 european rights activists slam guantanamo bay conditions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the video of the guantanamo inmate begging for help has sparked outrage european human rights activists have expressed alarm about a graphic video released this week showing a young canadian inmate at guantanamo bay weeping and calling out for help . a grainy seven-and-a-half hour video released by the lawyers of the youngest detainee held at the us military prison in cuba shows omar khadr weeping and begging for help .
" you do n't care about me , " khadr tells his interrogators .
" nobody cares about me . "
indeed , when khadr complains that the interrogators have not helped his case and asks to be returned home to canada , he is told , " we ca n't do anything for you . "
the video , shot over the course of four days in february 2003 when khadr was 16 and grilled by officials from the canadian security intelligence service spy agency is the first real insight into the conditions at guantanamo bay which have been slammed by human rights activists .
" for me that video is just the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang kaleck , general secretary of the european center for constitutional and human rights . " i 'm not an emotional person , but it 's easy when you watch that footage to fill in the blanks about what you 're not seeing . "
the united states is holding about 265 prisoners at guantanamo bay . 21-year-old omar khadr , the only western national among them , is charged with killing a us medic in afghanistan in 2002 at the age of 15 .
" this tape shows the inhumanity of what goes on at guantanamo , " said ferdinand muggenthaler , americas expert at amnesty international germany .
" though the video itself does n't show torture outright , it gives us an image of what happens there - the methods that interrogators are using . "
canada in violation of un protocol ?
in one excerpt , these methods include interrogators showing little sympathy for khadr 's myriad medical concerns .
" you look like you 're doing well to me , " says the interrogator .
" i 'm not a doctor but i think you 're getting good medical care . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .
if germany was able to secure the release of their nationals , canada should be able to do the same . "
canadian prime minister stephen harper does n't seem to agree , however .
though a canadian federal judge said khadr 's treatment at guantanamo bay violated international laws on human rights , the prime minister 's office held firm tuesday in its decision not to ask for khadr 's repatriation . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" you do n't care about me , " khadr tells his interrogators .
" nobody cares about me . "
indeed , when khadr complains that the interrogators have not helped his case and asks to be returned home to canada , he is told , " we ca n't do anything for you . "
the video , shot over the course of four days in february 2003 when khadr was 16 and grilled by officials from the canadian security intelligence service spy agency is the first real insight into the conditions at guantanamo bay which have been slammed by human rights activists .
" for me that video is just the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang kaleck , general secretary of the european center for constitutional and human rights . " i 'm not an emotional person , but it 's easy when you watch that footage to fill in the blanks about what you 're not seeing . "
the united states is holding about 265 prisoners at guantanamo bay . 21-year-old omar khadr , the only western national among them , is charged with killing a us medic in afghanistan in 2002 at the age of 15 .
" this tape shows the inhumanity of what goes on at guantanamo , " said ferdinand muggenthaler , americas expert at amnesty international germany .
" though the video itself does n't show torture outright , it gives us an image of what happens there - the methods that interrogators are using . "
canada in violation of un protocol ?
in one excerpt , these methods include interrogators showing little sympathy for khadr 's myriad medical concerns .
" you look like you 're doing well to me , " says the interrogator .
" i 'm not a doctor but i think you 're getting good medical care . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .

" the conclusion of the conference is that there is only limited scope for reducing " emissions " in the industrial sector and the eu climate package needs improvement in key areas , " said the ministry in a statement . the ministry was particularly critical of the eu 's goal to cut the quota of emissions trading permits by 21 percent , compared to 2005 levels , saying this would cost germany both jobs and growth .
as a major burner of fossil-fuels , which cause unwanted co2 emissions , germany would be especially hard hit by the plan , added the ministry . the statement also pointed out that an emissions trading program would result in a price hike for products that are useful in reaching climate goals , such as insulation glass and insulating construction materials . no more room for cuts , says economics ministry " due to exploding oil and gas prices , further measures to achieve climate goals should be considered only with great caution , " read the statement .
" rising energy prices are already a strong incentive to investment in renewable energies , energy savings and energy efficiency . " germany 's industry has already contributed extensively to reducing greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 , despite economic growth , but has little leeway to do more , it added . earlier this month , the eu proposed a legally-binding bloc-wide initiative to slash energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
eu environment ministers have suggested the use of biofuels as a way to cut carbon emissions by 35 percent in the short-term and by 50 percent by the year 2015 . eu legislators this month also approved an emissions trading plan for the aviation industry , which airlines say will drive up the price of flights . but as long a key polluters like the united states , china and india do n't implement similar strategies to reduce emissions , the eu 's efforts wo n't have a significant impact on global climate change , concluded the economics ministry . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court injunction , heard by the state court in kassel late on monday , forced the german national olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- to scratch poleska - who finished second in the qualifying trial - in favor of third-placed bernhardt , much to the chagrin of dosb president thomas bach .
bernhardt finished third in the 200 meters breaststroke at the german national championships in april , just failing to get a top two spot needed to make the team for beijing .
rather than graciously facing the fact that she had come up just short , bernhardt ruthlessly exposed a footnote law within the rules of the german championships to force the hand of the dosb .
rival poleska accused of breaking club rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poleska says she did n't race as a club member in the us the court in kessel heard that poleska - a born-and-bred german , a national champion and olympic bronze medalist from athens 2004 - had previously raced for the coral springs swimming club in florida and not a german club .
german swimming federation rules allow athletes to compete for foreign college or school swimming teams but not foreign clubs .
" i 've never seen anything like this before - an athlete trying to box her way onto the team because of a technicality , a mistake by a colleague , " bach told reporters .
poleska said she had done nothing wrong and was not a member of any club when she swam in the florida meets .
" i see my position as crystal clear from a legal point of view , " she said .
" i 'm not afraid at all that i 'll miss the olympics . "
germany 's olympic swimming coach orjan madsen was also sure that poleska and not bernhardt would be representing germany in beijing .
" ' the fact is that anne was nominated by the dosb and already has her olympic team clothes that she 'll be traveling to beijing in , " he said .
michael wolski , a lawyer and chairman of bernhardt 's club sg frankfurt which filed the legal challenge on her behalf , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung he had presented documents showing poleska took part in 10 club meets for coral springs .
" i can not imagine she did not know the rules , " wolski was quoted by the paper as saying .
" everyone knows those rules . "
this is not the first time that national german law has stood in the way of a fair outcome as viewed from a sporting perspective .
former gdr swimmer astrid strauss was banned for failing a doping test , but continued to race inside a reunified germany after her international ban because a judge decided it only fair .
bernhardt 's inclusion could lead to more court action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhardt can expect little support in the german team an executive board meeting will decide on july 20 if another swimmer will be pushed out of the german team by the decision forced by bernhardt 's undeserved olympic selection .
if this were to happen , bernhardt could well expect to spend more time in court than in the pool as the board 's decision would surely be the subject of a legal claim by the displaced swimmer .
if bernhardt does fly to beijing , it 's unlikely that she will be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the squad , especially those on the swimming team who will know that the third-best , and not second best , swimmer made the team and after a dirty legal challenge that went against all unwritten rules of sportsmanship .
more drama could follow if she is allowed in the squad .
olympic rules state that each country can only field two 200 meter breaststroke competitors .
with bernhardt making it three , she could cause further ill-feeling by getting the nod ahead of one of the other swimmers .
what is more likely in this scenario is that bernhardt will be forced to sit on the bench . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court injunction , heard by the state court in kassel late on monday , forced the german national olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- to scratch poleska - who finished second in the qualifying trial - in favor of third-placed bernhardt , much to the chagrin of dosb president thomas bach .
bernhardt finished third in the 200 meters breaststroke at the german national championships in april , just failing to get a top two spot needed to make the team for beijing .
rather than graciously facing the fact that she had come up just short , bernhardt ruthlessly exposed a footnote law within the rules of the german championships to force the hand of the dosb .
rival poleska accused of breaking club rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poleska says she did n't race as a club member in the us the court in kessel heard that poleska - a born-and-bred german , a national champion and olympic bronze medalist from athens 2004 - had previously raced for the coral springs swimming club in florida and not a german club .
german swimming federation rules allow athletes to compete for foreign college or school swimming teams but not foreign clubs .
" i 've never seen anything like this before - an athlete trying to box her way onto the team because of a technicality , a mistake by a colleague , " bach told reporters .
poleska said she had done nothing wrong and was not a member of any club when she swam in the florida meets .
" i see my position as crystal clear from a legal point of view , " she said .
" i 'm not afraid at all that i 'll miss the olympics . "
germany 's olympic swimming coach orjan madsen was also sure that poleska and not bernhardt would be representing germany in beijing .
" ' the fact is that anne was nominated by the dosb and already has her olympic team clothes that she 'll be traveling to beijing in , " he said .
michael wolski , a lawyer and chairman of bernhardt 's club sg frankfurt which filed the legal challenge on her behalf , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung he had presented documents showing poleska took part in 10 club meets for coral springs .
" i can not imagine she did not know the rules , " wolski was quoted by the paper as saying .
" everyone knows those rules . "
this is not the first time that national german law has stood in the way of a fair outcome as viewed from a sporting perspective .
former gdr swimmer astrid strauss was banned for failing a doping test , but continued to race inside a reunified germany after her international ban because a judge decided it only fair .
bernhardt 's inclusion could lead to more court action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhardt can expect little support in the german team an executive board meeting will decide on july 20 if another swimmer will be pushed out of the german team by the decision forced by bernhardt 's undeserved olympic selection .
if this were to happen , bernhardt could well expect to spend more time in court than in the pool as the board 's decision would surely be the subject of a legal claim by the displaced swimmer .
if bernhardt does fly to beijing , it 's unlikely that she will be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the squad , especially those on the swimming team who will know that the third-best , and not second best , swimmer made the team and after a dirty legal challenge that went against all unwritten rules of sportsmanship .
more drama could follow if she is allowed in the squad .
olympic rules state that each country can only field two 200 meter breaststroke competitors .
with bernhardt making it three , she could cause further ill-feeling by getting the nod ahead of one of the other swimmers .
what is more likely in this scenario is that bernhardt will be forced to sit on the bench . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if this were to happen , bernhardt could well expect to spend more time in court than in the pool as the board 's decision would surely be the subject of a legal claim by the displaced swimmer .
if bernhardt does fly to beijing , it 's unlikely that she will be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the squad , especially those on the swimming team who will know that the third-best , and not second best , swimmer made the team and after a dirty legal challenge that went against all unwritten rules of sportsmanship .
more drama could follow if she is allowed in the squad .
olympic rules state that each country can only field two 200 meter breaststroke competitors .
with bernhardt making it three , she could cause further ill-feeling by getting the nod ahead of one of the other swimmers .
what is more likely in this scenario is that bernhardt will be forced to sit on the bench . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the creators wanted to make an ironic statement about the tyrants but not everyone appreciates the joke . the game , called das fuehrer quartett , is based on a popular german children 's card game called quartett , but with a difference .
in the traditional game , the cards feature cars or flowers or even beer brands , which players try to collect from their opponents .
in this new version , the cards present pictures and information on notorious historical figures such as joseph stalin , francisco franco and adolf hitler . " we did n't really have a clear political idea in mind with the game , " said volker oppmann of onkel & onkel , the berlin-based publishing house behind the deck .
" but we did want to take away some of the power that these figures still have .
when you can laugh at them , you do n't fear them as much . " each card features one dictator , the country he ruled , his educational / vocational background and how long he was in power , among other factoids .
the cards stick to the historical record and also present information that might be less well known , oppmann , 33 , said . for example , the card featuring stalin explains that while in school he was repeatedly caught reading material that had been banned .
the card on romania 's nicolae ceausescu reveals that he had a soft spot for vlad the impaler , said to have been the inspiration for bram stoker 's " dracula . " lighter touch the cards have an ironic tone , and the authors use wordplay in some of the descriptive categories or have a lighter touch when presenting additional information about a figure .
for augusto pinochet , the card says he destroyed a democratic system with help from the us , but rebuilt another one later , only to be toppled by it .
" somehow stupid , " it says . " i think we succeeded in finding the right mix of seriousness and fun , " said oppmann . bildunterschrift : the public appears to appreciate the game 's ironic tone ; the decks have been selling fast .
of the first print run of 2,000 , oppmann said more than half are sold out and a second printing is planned . but not everyone thinks presenting war criminals as slightly risible figures is a positive thing . tasteless and inappropriate ? berlin senator ehrhart körting , 66 , called the deck tasteless .
historian arnulf baring said it played down the enormity of the crimes committed . " the further back the third reich recedes in history , the more bizarre the way it is dealt with becomes , " he told the bild newspaper . oppmann rejects the critique , pointing out that when the card game was released at this year 's leipzig book fair , employees from the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , a democratic political education organization , found the cards hilarious and ordered five decks right away . " if these people can laugh at it , i 'm not worried , " he said . in fact , the goal of das fuehrer quartett , unlike in traditional quartett , is not to gather as many cards and dictators as you can .

the latest was french oil group total which said in a statement it was withdrawing from the country .
british-dutch group shell publicly pulled out from a gas project in iran in may .
the iranian state is no longer a shareholder in german steel manufacturer thyssen-krupp and germany 's deutsche bank ended its 40-year association with iran .
iran seeks to court german investment the economic sanctions applied against iran have sparked much criticism in the business community .
german companies are among those who feel that trade restrictions with the islamic republic are harmful not only to iran .
however , some companies continue to work with iran despite the sanctions and profit from the refusal of others to trade with tehran .
those companies which remain in business in iran do so quietly .
german engineering giant siemens continues to operate in the country but insists that its business in iran accounts for less one percent of its turnover .
europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen says it still plans to expand its assembly-line cooperation in the country but insists " there 's nothing big " in the pipeline , according to a company spokesman .
oil giant bp has vowed it will not be involved in iran and says any future engagement " will be in accordance with us sanctions . "
iran relies heavily on german companies and their know-how , because a large part of the iranian industry depends on parts supplied by germany .
such is the need for german expertise that iranian vice foreign secretary mehdi safari specifically asked for more german investment in a recent statement : " we could easily have an exchange of commodities with germany which could total more than 20 billion euros , " he said .
as way of incentive , the iranian government has loosened investment laws and has privatized state enterprises so that foreign investors can take part .
by focusing on selling its energy sector , iran hopes to attract foreign investment in its oil and gas enterprises .
while iran has the second largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world , the country , hobbled by a lack of refineries and creaking infrastructure , still has to import gasoline .
china , russia picking up the slack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has stepped in to provide the goods germany wo n't while german investment in iran dropped by around 15 percent in the last year , china 's investments in the country are booming .
germany 's trade volume with iran totals around 3.5 billion euros , in comparison to china 's reported 30 billion dollars - an increase of 60 percent as compared to the previous year .
though the lion 's share of china 's profitable business with iran comes from its strong exports of consumer goods , some say there 's one overriding factor underpinning china 's success in the country .
" china , just like the russians , do n't take any notice of sanctions , " said daniel bernbeck , the head of the german-iranian chamber of commerce in teheran .
russia has doubled its trade with iran - much to the annoyance of european enterprises .
" if some countries abide by the restrictions of trade under the un sanctions and others do n't , then the sanction policy causes nothing but an imbalance in trade , " lamented felix neugart of the german chamber of industry and commerce .
domestic and international pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has promised hardship for those dealing with iran it 's not just the trade embargo on iran imposed by the un security council that 's hurting european businesses in iran .
the direct and indirect fallout of sanctions applied by the european union and germany are equally responsible for the plunge in profits .
for example , german companies who continue to export to iran can expect to have difficulties getting credit .
exports are also subject to such stringent controls that it 's difficult to make deliveries on time .
german companies also suffer from the fact that the accounts of the biggest iranian banks have been frozen and that german banks have exited iran .
there is also the question of which market is more important : iran or the united states ?
pursuing or maintaining trade links with iran runs the risk of angering the us , which has taken the lead in pressurizing european firms to sever trade links with iran .
european companies that continue to trade with iran can expect a hard time in the united states .
sidestepping sanctions still , experts say trade with iran is n't entirely impossible and some european companies do find a way to dodge un sanctions .
" the money just flows via third countries and most of the transactions take place in hard cash , " said bernbeck who lives in teheran .
in such a secretive climate , the focus is on a discreet network of middlemen who literally accept suitcases with wads of money and smuggle it out of the country .
" they 're medieval methods of doing business , " said bernbeck , who said he withdrew money from his bank in germany to pay his yearly rent in cash to his landlady in teheran , usually in cash in a bar .
" if a plane crashes on its way to tehran from germany , then the loss of the luggage would be more expensive than the loss of the plane , " he said .
change in political approach would help trade business federations describe the current policy towards iran as " paranoia combined with hysteria . "
though german exports to iran rose slightly this year , experts say in the long-run there will be a major shift in iran 's trading partners as the country looks for other investors and business players .
" germany certainly stands to lose in such a situation , " said henner fuertig of the leibniz institute for global and regional studies .
at present , saudi arabia is a favorite trading partner of the iranians .
the gulf nation has offered russia wide-ranging arms deals if in return moscow deepens cooperation with iran .
the future for trade with iran is as unstable as the international relationship with tehran .
" one should not hold on to the hope that iran will come around through sanctions alone , " said johannes reissner of the german foundation for science and politics .
a serious debate with - and about - iran must be restarted without political brinkmanship , he added .
many other experts support reissner 's view that the removal of sanctions and a return to diplomatic discussion without threats would be more constructive .
bildunterschrift : face-to-face negotiations between the eu and iran failed and have yet to be restarted " it 's not like we did n't talk to iran , " said one diplomat close to the west 's negotiations who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity .
" but the carrot and stick approach did n't work .
now we 've worked on both levels , " he said , referring to offering iran a repreive from economic and financial sanctions in exchange for freezing its enrichment activites .
while the rhetoric increases , the hidden trade with iran still blossoms .
the industrial parts , which germany refuses to deliver , now come from england .
asia is also scrambling to catch up with the west by exporting industrial know-how .
us trade increases as washington pressures others and the us is n't far behind .
us exports to iran have hugely increased during the bush administration 's two terms , showing stronger growth than under any other us government .
us goods to the value of $ 150 million were shipped into iran in 2007 alone .
all of which rankles with european investors who feel the pressure not to deal with tehran emanating from washington .
meanwhile , german companies continue to bail out of iran .
even a german manufacturer of faucets for bathtubs has discontinued his long-standing relationship with an iranian customer - because of the fear that the us could find out that he trades with iran .

the latest was french oil group total which said in a statement it was withdrawing from the country .
british-dutch group shell publicly pulled out from a gas project in iran in may .
the iranian state is no longer a shareholder in german steel manufacturer thyssen-krupp and germany 's deutsche bank ended its 40-year association with iran .
iran seeks to court german investment the economic sanctions applied against iran have sparked much criticism in the business community .
german companies are among those who feel that trade restrictions with the islamic republic are harmful not only to iran .
however , some companies continue to work with iran despite the sanctions and profit from the refusal of others to trade with tehran .
those companies which remain in business in iran do so quietly .
german engineering giant siemens continues to operate in the country but insists that its business in iran accounts for less one percent of its turnover .
europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen says it still plans to expand its assembly-line cooperation in the country but insists " there 's nothing big " in the pipeline , according to a company spokesman .
oil giant bp has vowed it will not be involved in iran and says any future engagement " will be in accordance with us sanctions . "
iran relies heavily on german companies and their know-how , because a large part of the iranian industry depends on parts supplied by germany .
such is the need for german expertise that iranian vice foreign secretary mehdi safari specifically asked for more german investment in a recent statement : " we could easily have an exchange of commodities with germany which could total more than 20 billion euros , " he said .
as way of incentive , the iranian government has loosened investment laws and has privatized state enterprises so that foreign investors can take part .
by focusing on selling its energy sector , iran hopes to attract foreign investment in its oil and gas enterprises .
while iran has the second largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world , the country , hobbled by a lack of refineries and creaking infrastructure , still has to import gasoline .
china , russia picking up the slack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has stepped in to provide the goods germany wo n't while german investment in iran dropped by around 15 percent in the last year , china 's investments in the country are booming .
germany 's trade volume with iran totals around 3.5 billion euros , in comparison to china 's reported 30 billion dollars - an increase of 60 percent as compared to the previous year .
though the lion 's share of china 's profitable business with iran comes from its strong exports of consumer goods , some say there 's one overriding factor underpinning china 's success in the country .
" china , just like the russians , do n't take any notice of sanctions , " said daniel bernbeck , the head of the german-iranian chamber of commerce in teheran .
russia has doubled its trade with iran - much to the annoyance of european enterprises .
" if some countries abide by the restrictions of trade under the un sanctions and others do n't , then the sanction policy causes nothing but an imbalance in trade , " lamented felix neugart of the german chamber of industry and commerce .
domestic and international pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has promised hardship for those dealing with iran it 's not just the trade embargo on iran imposed by the un security council that 's hurting european businesses in iran .
the direct and indirect fallout of sanctions applied by the european union and germany are equally responsible for the plunge in profits .
for example , german companies who continue to export to iran can expect to have difficulties getting credit .
exports are also subject to such stringent controls that it 's difficult to make deliveries on time .
german companies also suffer from the fact that the accounts of the biggest iranian banks have been frozen and that german banks have exited iran .
there is also the question of which market is more important : iran or the united states ?
pursuing or maintaining trade links with iran runs the risk of angering the us , which has taken the lead in pressurizing european firms to sever trade links with iran .
european companies that continue to trade with iran can expect a hard time in the united states .
sidestepping sanctions still , experts say trade with iran is n't entirely impossible and some european companies do find a way to dodge un sanctions .
" the money just flows via third countries and most of the transactions take place in hard cash , " said bernbeck who lives in teheran .
in such a secretive climate , the focus is on a discreet network of middlemen who literally accept suitcases with wads of money and smuggle it out of the country .
" they 're medieval methods of doing business , " said bernbeck , who said he withdrew money from his bank in germany to pay his yearly rent in cash to his landlady in teheran , usually in cash in a bar .
" if a plane crashes on its way to tehran from germany , then the loss of the luggage would be more expensive than the loss of the plane , " he said .
change in political approach would help trade business federations describe the current policy towards iran as " paranoia combined with hysteria . "
though german exports to iran rose slightly this year , experts say in the long-run there will be a major shift in iran 's trading partners as the country looks for other investors and business players .
" germany certainly stands to lose in such a situation , " said henner fuertig of the leibniz institute for global and regional studies .
at present , saudi arabia is a favorite trading partner of the iranians .
the gulf nation has offered russia wide-ranging arms deals if in return moscow deepens cooperation with iran .
the future for trade with iran is as unstable as the international relationship with tehran .
" one should not hold on to the hope that iran will come around through sanctions alone , " said johannes reissner of the german foundation for science and politics .
a serious debate with - and about - iran must be restarted without political brinkmanship , he added .
many other experts support reissner 's view that the removal of sanctions and a return to diplomatic discussion without threats would be more constructive .
bildunterschrift : face-to-face negotiations between the eu and iran failed and have yet to be restarted " it 's not like we did n't talk to iran , " said one diplomat close to the west 's negotiations who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity .
" but the carrot and stick approach did n't work .
now we 've worked on both levels , " he said , referring to offering iran a repreive from economic and financial sanctions in exchange for freezing its enrichment activites .
while the rhetoric increases , the hidden trade with iran still blossoms .
the industrial parts , which germany refuses to deliver , now come from england .
asia is also scrambling to catch up with the west by exporting industrial know-how .
us trade increases as washington pressures others and the us is n't far behind .
us exports to iran have hugely increased during the bush administration 's two terms , showing stronger growth than under any other us government .
us goods to the value of $ 150 million were shipped into iran in 2007 alone .
all of which rankles with european investors who feel the pressure not to deal with tehran emanating from washington .
meanwhile , german companies continue to bail out of iran .
even a german manufacturer of faucets for bathtubs has discontinued his long-standing relationship with an iranian customer - because of the fear that the us could find out that he trades with iran .

the latest was french oil group total which said in a statement it was withdrawing from the country .
british-dutch group shell publicly pulled out from a gas project in iran in may .
the iranian state is no longer a shareholder in german steel manufacturer thyssen-krupp and germany 's deutsche bank ended its 40-year association with iran .
iran seeks to court german investment the economic sanctions applied against iran have sparked much criticism in the business community .
german companies are among those who feel that trade restrictions with the islamic republic are harmful not only to iran .
however , some companies continue to work with iran despite the sanctions and profit from the refusal of others to trade with tehran .
those companies which remain in business in iran do so quietly .
german engineering giant siemens continues to operate in the country but insists that its business in iran accounts for less one percent of its turnover .
europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen says it still plans to expand its assembly-line cooperation in the country but insists " there 's nothing big " in the pipeline , according to a company spokesman .
oil giant bp has vowed it will not be involved in iran and says any future engagement " will be in accordance with us sanctions . "
iran relies heavily on german companies and their know-how , because a large part of the iranian industry depends on parts supplied by germany .
such is the need for german expertise that iranian vice foreign secretary mehdi safari specifically asked for more german investment in a recent statement : " we could easily have an exchange of commodities with germany which could total more than 20 billion euros , " he said .
as way of incentive , the iranian government has loosened investment laws and has privatized state enterprises so that foreign investors can take part .
by focusing on selling its energy sector , iran hopes to attract foreign investment in its oil and gas enterprises .
while iran has the second largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world , the country , hobbled by a lack of refineries and creaking infrastructure , still has to import gasoline .
china , russia picking up the slack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has stepped in to provide the goods germany wo n't while german investment in iran dropped by around 15 percent in the last year , china 's investments in the country are booming .
germany 's trade volume with iran totals around 3.5 billion euros , in comparison to china 's reported 30 billion dollars - an increase of 60 percent as compared to the previous year .
though the lion 's share of china 's profitable business with iran comes from its strong exports of consumer goods , some say there 's one overriding factor underpinning china 's success in the country .
" china , just like the russians , do n't take any notice of sanctions , " said daniel bernbeck , the head of the german-iranian chamber of commerce in teheran .
russia has doubled its trade with iran - much to the annoyance of european enterprises .
" if some countries abide by the restrictions of trade under the un sanctions and others do n't , then the sanction policy causes nothing but an imbalance in trade , " lamented felix neugart of the german chamber of industry and commerce .
domestic and international pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has promised hardship for those dealing with iran it 's not just the trade embargo on iran imposed by the un security council that 's hurting european businesses in iran .
the direct and indirect fallout of sanctions applied by the european union and germany are equally responsible for the plunge in profits .
for example , german companies who continue to export to iran can expect to have difficulties getting credit .
exports are also subject to such stringent controls that it 's difficult to make deliveries on time .
german companies also suffer from the fact that the accounts of the biggest iranian banks have been frozen and that german banks have exited iran .
there is also the question of which market is more important : iran or the united states ?
pursuing or maintaining trade links with iran runs the risk of angering the us , which has taken the lead in pressurizing european firms to sever trade links with iran .
european companies that continue to trade with iran can expect a hard time in the united states .
sidestepping sanctions still , experts say trade with iran is n't entirely impossible and some european companies do find a way to dodge un sanctions .
" the money just flows via third countries and most of the transactions take place in hard cash , " said bernbeck who lives in teheran .
in such a secretive climate , the focus is on a discreet network of middlemen who literally accept suitcases with wads of money and smuggle it out of the country .
" they 're medieval methods of doing business , " said bernbeck , who said he withdrew money from his bank in germany to pay his yearly rent in cash to his landlady in teheran , usually in cash in a bar .
" if a plane crashes on its way to tehran from germany , then the loss of the luggage would be more expensive than the loss of the plane , " he said .
change in political approach would help trade business federations describe the current policy towards iran as " paranoia combined with hysteria . "
though german exports to iran rose slightly this year , experts say in the long-run there will be a major shift in iran 's trading partners as the country looks for other investors and business players .
" germany certainly stands to lose in such a situation , " said henner fuertig of the leibniz institute for global and regional studies .
at present , saudi arabia is a favorite trading partner of the iranians .
the gulf nation has offered russia wide-ranging arms deals if in return moscow deepens cooperation with iran .
the future for trade with iran is as unstable as the international relationship with tehran .
" one should not hold on to the hope that iran will come around through sanctions alone , " said johannes reissner of the german foundation for science and politics .
a serious debate with - and about - iran must be restarted without political brinkmanship , he added .
many other experts support reissner 's view that the removal of sanctions and a return to diplomatic discussion without threats would be more constructive .
bildunterschrift : face-to-face negotiations between the eu and iran failed and have yet to be restarted " it 's not like we did n't talk to iran , " said one diplomat close to the west 's negotiations who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity .
" but the carrot and stick approach did n't work .
now we 've worked on both levels , " he said , referring to offering iran a repreive from economic and financial sanctions in exchange for freezing its enrichment activites .
while the rhetoric increases , the hidden trade with iran still blossoms .
the industrial parts , which germany refuses to deliver , now come from england .
asia is also scrambling to catch up with the west by exporting industrial know-how .
us trade increases as washington pressures others and the us is n't far behind .
us exports to iran have hugely increased during the bush administration 's two terms , showing stronger growth than under any other us government .
us goods to the value of $ 150 million were shipped into iran in 2007 alone .
all of which rankles with european investors who feel the pressure not to deal with tehran emanating from washington .
meanwhile , german companies continue to bail out of iran .
even a german manufacturer of faucets for bathtubs has discontinued his long-standing relationship with an iranian customer - because of the fear that the us could find out that he trades with iran .
this is absurd , criticizes daniel bernbeck .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 16.07.2008 european rights activists slam guantanamo bay conditions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the video of the guantanamo inmate begging for help has sparked outrage european human rights activists have expressed alarm about a graphic video released this week showing a young canadian inmate at guantanamo bay weeping and calling out for help . a grainy seven-and-a-half hour video released by the lawyers of the youngest detainee held at the us military prison in cuba shows omar khadr weeping and begging for help .
" you do n't care about me , " khadr tells his interrogators .
" nobody cares about me . "
indeed , when khadr complains that the interrogators have not helped his case and asks to be returned home to canada , he is told , " we ca n't do anything for you . "
the video , shot over the course of four days in february 2003 when khadr was 16 and grilled by officials from the canadian security intelligence service spy agency is the first real insight into the conditions at guantanamo bay which have been slammed by human rights activists .
" for me that video is just the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang kaleck , general secretary of the european center for constitutional and human rights . " i 'm not an emotional person , but it 's easy when you watch that footage to fill in the blanks about what you 're not seeing . "
the united states is holding about 265 prisoners at guantanamo bay . 21-year-old omar khadr , the only western national among them , is charged with killing a us medic in afghanistan in 2002 at the age of 15 .
" this tape shows the inhumanity of what goes on at guantanamo , " said ferdinand muggenthaler , americas expert at amnesty international germany .
" though the video itself does n't show torture outright , it gives us an image of what happens there - the methods that interrogators are using . "
canada in violation of un protocol ?
in one excerpt , these methods include interrogators showing little sympathy for khadr 's myriad medical concerns .
" you look like you 're doing well to me , " says the interrogator .
" i 'm not a doctor but i think you 're getting good medical care . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .
if germany was able to secure the release of their nationals , canada should be able to do the same . "
canadian prime minister stephen harper does n't seem to agree , however .
though a canadian federal judge said khadr 's treatment at guantanamo bay violated international laws on human rights , the prime minister 's office held firm tuesday in its decision not to ask for khadr 's repatriation . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the conclusion of the conference is that there is only limited scope for reducing " emissions " in the industrial sector and the eu climate package needs improvement in key areas , " said the ministry in a statement . the ministry was particularly critical of the eu 's goal to cut the quota of emissions trading permits by 21 percent , compared to 2005 levels , saying this would cost germany both jobs and growth .
as a major burner of fossil-fuels , which cause unwanted co2 emissions , germany would be especially hard hit by the plan , added the ministry . the statement also pointed out that an emissions trading program would result in a price hike for products that are useful in reaching climate goals , such as insulation glass and insulating construction materials . no more room for cuts , says economics ministry " due to exploding oil and gas prices , further measures to achieve climate goals should be considered only with great caution , " read the statement .

" we will be selling 800,000 volkswagens per year in the us by 2018 , and this new site will play a key role , " winterkorn forecast .
vw had been searching for the location of an assembly line to protect it from a relentless rise of the euro that has affected profits in north america .

the court injunction , heard by the state court in kassel late on monday , forced the german national olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- to scratch poleska - who finished second in the qualifying trial - in favor of third-placed bernhardt , much to the chagrin of dosb president thomas bach .
bernhardt finished third in the 200 meters breaststroke at the german national championships in april , just failing to get a top two spot needed to make the team for beijing .
rather than graciously facing the fact that she had come up just short , bernhardt ruthlessly exposed a footnote law within the rules of the german championships to force the hand of the dosb .
rival poleska accused of breaking club rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poleska says she did n't race as a club member in the us the court in kessel heard that poleska - a born-and-bred german , a national champion and olympic bronze medalist from athens 2004 - had previously raced for the coral springs swimming club in florida and not a german club .
german swimming federation rules allow athletes to compete for foreign college or school swimming teams but not foreign clubs .
" i 've never seen anything like this before - an athlete trying to box her way onto the team because of a technicality , a mistake by a colleague , " bach told reporters .
poleska said she had done nothing wrong and was not a member of any club when she swam in the florida meets .
" i see my position as crystal clear from a legal point of view , " she said .
" i 'm not afraid at all that i 'll miss the olympics . "
germany 's olympic swimming coach orjan madsen was also sure that poleska and not bernhardt would be representing germany in beijing .
" ' the fact is that anne was nominated by the dosb and already has her olympic team clothes that she 'll be traveling to beijing in , " he said .
michael wolski , a lawyer and chairman of bernhardt 's club sg frankfurt which filed the legal challenge on her behalf , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung he had presented documents showing poleska took part in 10 club meets for coral springs .
" i can not imagine she did not know the rules , " wolski was quoted by the paper as saying .
" everyone knows those rules . "
this is not the first time that national german law has stood in the way of a fair outcome as viewed from a sporting perspective .
former gdr swimmer astrid strauss was banned for failing a doping test , but continued to race inside a reunified germany after her international ban because a judge decided it only fair .
bernhardt 's inclusion could lead to more court action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhardt can expect little support in the german team an executive board meeting will decide on july 20 if another swimmer will be pushed out of the german team by the decision forced by bernhardt 's undeserved olympic selection .
if this were to happen , bernhardt could well expect to spend more time in court than in the pool as the board 's decision would surely be the subject of a legal claim by the displaced swimmer .
if bernhardt does fly to beijing , it 's unlikely that she will be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the squad , especially those on the swimming team who will know that the third-best , and not second best , swimmer made the team and after a dirty legal challenge that went against all unwritten rules of sportsmanship .
more drama could follow if she is allowed in the squad .
olympic rules state that each country can only field two 200 meter breaststroke competitors .
with bernhardt making it three , she could cause further ill-feeling by getting the nod ahead of one of the other swimmers .

the court injunction , heard by the state court in kassel late on monday , forced the german national olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- to scratch poleska - who finished second in the qualifying trial - in favor of third-placed bernhardt , much to the chagrin of dosb president thomas bach .
bernhardt finished third in the 200 meters breaststroke at the german national championships in april , just failing to get a top two spot needed to make the team for beijing .
rather than graciously facing the fact that she had come up just short , bernhardt ruthlessly exposed a footnote law within the rules of the german championships to force the hand of the dosb .
rival poleska accused of breaking club rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poleska says she did n't race as a club member in the us the court in kessel heard that poleska - a born-and-bred german , a national champion and olympic bronze medalist from athens 2004 - had previously raced for the coral springs swimming club in florida and not a german club .
german swimming federation rules allow athletes to compete for foreign college or school swimming teams but not foreign clubs .
" i 've never seen anything like this before - an athlete trying to box her way onto the team because of a technicality , a mistake by a colleague , " bach told reporters .
poleska said she had done nothing wrong and was not a member of any club when she swam in the florida meets .
" i see my position as crystal clear from a legal point of view , " she said .
" i 'm not afraid at all that i 'll miss the olympics . "
germany 's olympic swimming coach orjan madsen was also sure that poleska and not bernhardt would be representing germany in beijing .
" ' the fact is that anne was nominated by the dosb and already has her olympic team clothes that she 'll be traveling to beijing in , " he said .
michael wolski , a lawyer and chairman of bernhardt 's club sg frankfurt which filed the legal challenge on her behalf , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung he had presented documents showing poleska took part in 10 club meets for coral springs .
" i can not imagine she did not know the rules , " wolski was quoted by the paper as saying .
" everyone knows those rules . "
this is not the first time that national german law has stood in the way of a fair outcome as viewed from a sporting perspective .
former gdr swimmer astrid strauss was banned for failing a doping test , but continued to race inside a reunified germany after her international ban because a judge decided it only fair .
bernhardt 's inclusion could lead to more court action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhardt can expect little support in the german team an executive board meeting will decide on july 20 if another swimmer will be pushed out of the german team by the decision forced by bernhardt 's undeserved olympic selection .
if this were to happen , bernhardt could well expect to spend more time in court than in the pool as the board 's decision would surely be the subject of a legal claim by the displaced swimmer .
if bernhardt does fly to beijing , it 's unlikely that she will be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the squad , especially those on the swimming team who will know that the third-best , and not second best , swimmer made the team and after a dirty legal challenge that went against all unwritten rules of sportsmanship .
more drama could follow if she is allowed in the squad .
olympic rules state that each country can only field two 200 meter breaststroke competitors .
with bernhardt making it three , she could cause further ill-feeling by getting the nod ahead of one of the other swimmers .
what is more likely in this scenario is that bernhardt will be forced to sit on the bench . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the creators wanted to make an ironic statement about the tyrants but not everyone appreciates the joke . the game , called das fuehrer quartett , is based on a popular german children 's card game called quartett , but with a difference .
in the traditional game , the cards feature cars or flowers or even beer brands , which players try to collect from their opponents .
in this new version , the cards present pictures and information on notorious historical figures such as joseph stalin , francisco franco and adolf hitler . " we did n't really have a clear political idea in mind with the game , " said volker oppmann of onkel & onkel , the berlin-based publishing house behind the deck .
" but we did want to take away some of the power that these figures still have .
when you can laugh at them , you do n't fear them as much . " each card features one dictator , the country he ruled , his educational / vocational background and how long he was in power , among other factoids .
the cards stick to the historical record and also present information that might be less well known , oppmann , 33 , said . for example , the card featuring stalin explains that while in school he was repeatedly caught reading material that had been banned .
the card on romania 's nicolae ceausescu reveals that he had a soft spot for vlad the impaler , said to have been the inspiration for bram stoker 's " dracula . " lighter touch the cards have an ironic tone , and the authors use wordplay in some of the descriptive categories or have a lighter touch when presenting additional information about a figure .
for augusto pinochet , the card says he destroyed a democratic system with help from the us , but rebuilt another one later , only to be toppled by it .
" somehow stupid , " it says . " i think we succeeded in finding the right mix of seriousness and fun , " said oppmann . bildunterschrift : the public appears to appreciate the game 's ironic tone ; the decks have been selling fast .
of the first print run of 2,000 , oppmann said more than half are sold out and a second printing is planned . but not everyone thinks presenting war criminals as slightly risible figures is a positive thing . tasteless and inappropriate ? berlin senator ehrhart körting , 66 , called the deck tasteless .
historian arnulf baring said it played down the enormity of the crimes committed . " the further back the third reich recedes in history , the more bizarre the way it is dealt with becomes , " he told the bild newspaper . oppmann rejects the critique , pointing out that when the card game was released at this year 's leipzig book fair , employees from the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , a democratic political education organization , found the cards hilarious and ordered five decks right away . " if these people can laugh at it , i 'm not worried , " he said . in fact , the goal of das fuehrer quartett , unlike in traditional quartett , is not to gather as many cards and dictators as you can .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 16.07.2008 european rights activists slam guantanamo bay conditions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the video of the guantanamo inmate begging for help has sparked outrage european human rights activists have expressed alarm about a graphic video released this week showing a young canadian inmate at guantanamo bay weeping and calling out for help . a grainy seven-and-a-half hour video released by the lawyers of the youngest detainee held at the us military prison in cuba shows omar khadr weeping and begging for help .
" you do n't care about me , " khadr tells his interrogators .
" nobody cares about me . "
indeed , when khadr complains that the interrogators have not helped his case and asks to be returned home to canada , he is told , " we ca n't do anything for you . "
the video , shot over the course of four days in february 2003 when khadr was 16 and grilled by officials from the canadian security intelligence service spy agency is the first real insight into the conditions at guantanamo bay which have been slammed by human rights activists .
" for me that video is just the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang kaleck , general secretary of the european center for constitutional and human rights . " i 'm not an emotional person , but it 's easy when you watch that footage to fill in the blanks about what you 're not seeing . "
the united states is holding about 265 prisoners at guantanamo bay . 21-year-old omar khadr , the only western national among them , is charged with killing a us medic in afghanistan in 2002 at the age of 15 .
" this tape shows the inhumanity of what goes on at guantanamo , " said ferdinand muggenthaler , americas expert at amnesty international germany .
" though the video itself does n't show torture outright , it gives us an image of what happens there - the methods that interrogators are using . "
canada in violation of un protocol ?
in one excerpt , these methods include interrogators showing little sympathy for khadr 's myriad medical concerns .
" you look like you 're doing well to me , " says the interrogator .
" i 'm not a doctor but i think you 're getting good medical care . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .
if germany was able to secure the release of their nationals , canada should be able to do the same . "
canadian prime minister stephen harper does n't seem to agree , however .
though a canadian federal judge said khadr 's treatment at guantanamo bay violated international laws on human rights , the prime minister 's office held firm tuesday in its decision not to ask for khadr 's repatriation . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" you do n't care about me , " khadr tells his interrogators .
" nobody cares about me . "
indeed , when khadr complains that the interrogators have not helped his case and asks to be returned home to canada , he is told , " we ca n't do anything for you . "
the video , shot over the course of four days in february 2003 when khadr was 16 and grilled by officials from the canadian security intelligence service spy agency is the first real insight into the conditions at guantanamo bay which have been slammed by human rights activists .
" for me that video is just the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang kaleck , general secretary of the european center for constitutional and human rights . " i 'm not an emotional person , but it 's easy when you watch that footage to fill in the blanks about what you 're not seeing . "
the united states is holding about 265 prisoners at guantanamo bay . 21-year-old omar khadr , the only western national among them , is charged with killing a us medic in afghanistan in 2002 at the age of 15 .
" this tape shows the inhumanity of what goes on at guantanamo , " said ferdinand muggenthaler , americas expert at amnesty international germany .
" though the video itself does n't show torture outright , it gives us an image of what happens there - the methods that interrogators are using . "
canada in violation of un protocol ?
in one excerpt , these methods include interrogators showing little sympathy for khadr 's myriad medical concerns .
" you look like you 're doing well to me , " says the interrogator .
" i 'm not a doctor but i think you 're getting good medical care . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .
if germany was able to secure the release of their nationals , canada should be able to do the same . "
canadian prime minister stephen harper does n't seem to agree , however .
though a canadian federal judge said khadr 's treatment at guantanamo bay violated international laws on human rights , the prime minister 's office held firm tuesday in its decision not to ask for khadr 's repatriation . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 16.07.2008 german companies feel the pain in sanctions-hit iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german industrial know-how is needed by iran but is being denied through sanctions german companies , especially hard hit by trade and economic sanctions against iran , are worried they are losing lucrative contracts in the oil-rich region to countries such as china and russia . reeling under the fallout of trade sanctions and international pressure to cut ties with a oil-rich nation that the west suspects of covertly enriching uranium to build nuclear weapons , many large european companies have either completely pulled out of iran or have put the brakes on business expansion in the country .
the latest was french oil group total which said in a statement it was withdrawing from the country .
british-dutch group shell publicly pulled out from a gas project in iran in may .
the iranian state is no longer a shareholder in german steel manufacturer thyssen-krupp and germany 's deutsche bank ended its 40-year association with iran .
iran seeks to court german investment the economic sanctions applied against iran have sparked much criticism in the business community .
german companies are among those who feel that trade restrictions with the islamic republic are harmful not only to iran .
however , some companies continue to work with iran despite the sanctions and profit from the refusal of others to trade with tehran .
those companies which remain in business in iran do so quietly .
german engineering giant siemens continues to operate in the country but insists that its business in iran accounts for less one percent of its turnover .
europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen says it still plans to expand its assembly-line cooperation in the country but insists " there 's nothing big " in the pipeline , according to a company spokesman .
oil giant bp has vowed it will not be involved in iran and says any future engagement " will be in accordance with us sanctions . "
iran relies heavily on german companies and their know-how , because a large part of the iranian industry depends on parts supplied by germany .
such is the need for german expertise that iranian vice foreign secretary mehdi safari specifically asked for more german investment in a recent statement : " we could easily have an exchange of commodities with germany which could total more than 20 billion euros , " he said .
as way of incentive , the iranian government has loosened investment laws and has privatized state enterprises so that foreign investors can take part .
by focusing on selling its energy sector , iran hopes to attract foreign investment in its oil and gas enterprises .
while iran has the second largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world , the country , hobbled by a lack of refineries and creaking infrastructure , still has to import gasoline .
china , russia picking up the slack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has stepped in to provide the goods germany wo n't while german investment in iran dropped by around 15 percent in the last year , china 's investments in the country are booming .
germany 's trade volume with iran totals around 3.5 billion euros , in comparison to china 's reported 30 billion dollars - an increase of 60 percent as compared to the previous year .
though the lion 's share of china 's profitable business with iran comes from its strong exports of consumer goods , some say there 's one overriding factor underpinning china 's success in the country .
" china , just like the russians , do n't take any notice of sanctions , " said daniel bernbeck , the head of the german-iranian chamber of commerce in teheran .
russia has doubled its trade with iran - much to the annoyance of european enterprises .
" if some countries abide by the restrictions of trade under the un sanctions and others do n't , then the sanction policy causes nothing but an imbalance in trade , " lamented felix neugart of the german chamber of industry and commerce .
domestic and international pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has promised hardship for those dealing with iran it 's not just the trade embargo on iran imposed by the un security council that 's hurting european businesses in iran .
the direct and indirect fallout of sanctions applied by the european union and germany are equally responsible for the plunge in profits .
for example , german companies who continue to export to iran can expect to have difficulties getting credit .
exports are also subject to such stringent controls that it 's difficult to make deliveries on time .
german companies also suffer from the fact that the accounts of the biggest iranian banks have been frozen and that german banks have exited iran .
there is also the question of which market is more important : iran or the united states ?
pursuing or maintaining trade links with iran runs the risk of angering the us , which has taken the lead in pressurizing european firms to sever trade links with iran .
european companies that continue to trade with iran can expect a hard time in the united states .
sidestepping sanctions still , experts say trade with iran is n't entirely impossible and some european companies do find a way to dodge un sanctions .
" the money just flows via third countries and most of the transactions take place in hard cash , " said bernbeck who lives in teheran .
in such a secretive climate , the focus is on a discreet network of middlemen who literally accept suitcases with wads of money and smuggle it out of the country .

" one should not hold on to the hope that iran will come around through sanctions alone , " said johannes reissner of the german foundation for science and politics .
a serious debate with - and about - iran must be restarted without political brinkmanship , he added .
many other experts support reissner 's view that the removal of sanctions and a return to diplomatic discussion without threats would be more constructive .
bildunterschrift : face-to-face negotiations between the eu and iran failed and have yet to be restarted " it 's not like we did n't talk to iran , " said one diplomat close to the west 's negotiations who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity .
" but the carrot and stick approach did n't work .

the latest was french oil group total which said in a statement it was withdrawing from the country .
british-dutch group shell publicly pulled out from a gas project in iran in may .
the iranian state is no longer a shareholder in german steel manufacturer thyssen-krupp and germany 's deutsche bank ended its 40-year association with iran .
iran seeks to court german investment the economic sanctions applied against iran have sparked much criticism in the business community .
german companies are among those who feel that trade restrictions with the islamic republic are harmful not only to iran .
however , some companies continue to work with iran despite the sanctions and profit from the refusal of others to trade with tehran .
those companies which remain in business in iran do so quietly .
german engineering giant siemens continues to operate in the country but insists that its business in iran accounts for less one percent of its turnover .
europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen says it still plans to expand its assembly-line cooperation in the country but insists " there 's nothing big " in the pipeline , according to a company spokesman .
oil giant bp has vowed it will not be involved in iran and says any future engagement " will be in accordance with us sanctions . "
iran relies heavily on german companies and their know-how , because a large part of the iranian industry depends on parts supplied by germany .
such is the need for german expertise that iranian vice foreign secretary mehdi safari specifically asked for more german investment in a recent statement : " we could easily have an exchange of commodities with germany which could total more than 20 billion euros , " he said .
as way of incentive , the iranian government has loosened investment laws and has privatized state enterprises so that foreign investors can take part .
by focusing on selling its energy sector , iran hopes to attract foreign investment in its oil and gas enterprises .
while iran has the second largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world , the country , hobbled by a lack of refineries and creaking infrastructure , still has to import gasoline .
china , russia picking up the slack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has stepped in to provide the goods germany wo n't while german investment in iran dropped by around 15 percent in the last year , china 's investments in the country are booming .
germany 's trade volume with iran totals around 3.5 billion euros , in comparison to china 's reported 30 billion dollars - an increase of 60 percent as compared to the previous year .
though the lion 's share of china 's profitable business with iran comes from its strong exports of consumer goods , some say there 's one overriding factor underpinning china 's success in the country .
" china , just like the russians , do n't take any notice of sanctions , " said daniel bernbeck , the head of the german-iranian chamber of commerce in teheran .
russia has doubled its trade with iran - much to the annoyance of european enterprises .
" if some countries abide by the restrictions of trade under the un sanctions and others do n't , then the sanction policy causes nothing but an imbalance in trade , " lamented felix neugart of the german chamber of industry and commerce .
domestic and international pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has promised hardship for those dealing with iran it 's not just the trade embargo on iran imposed by the un security council that 's hurting european businesses in iran .
the direct and indirect fallout of sanctions applied by the european union and germany are equally responsible for the plunge in profits .
for example , german companies who continue to export to iran can expect to have difficulties getting credit .
exports are also subject to such stringent controls that it 's difficult to make deliveries on time .
german companies also suffer from the fact that the accounts of the biggest iranian banks have been frozen and that german banks have exited iran .
there is also the question of which market is more important : iran or the united states ?
pursuing or maintaining trade links with iran runs the risk of angering the us , which has taken the lead in pressurizing european firms to sever trade links with iran .

the latest was french oil group total which said in a statement it was withdrawing from the country .
british-dutch group shell publicly pulled out from a gas project in iran in may .
the iranian state is no longer a shareholder in german steel manufacturer thyssen-krupp and germany 's deutsche bank ended its 40-year association with iran .
iran seeks to court german investment the economic sanctions applied against iran have sparked much criticism in the business community .
german companies are among those who feel that trade restrictions with the islamic republic are harmful not only to iran .
however , some companies continue to work with iran despite the sanctions and profit from the refusal of others to trade with tehran .
those companies which remain in business in iran do so quietly .
german engineering giant siemens continues to operate in the country but insists that its business in iran accounts for less one percent of its turnover .
europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen says it still plans to expand its assembly-line cooperation in the country but insists " there 's nothing big " in the pipeline , according to a company spokesman .
oil giant bp has vowed it will not be involved in iran and says any future engagement " will be in accordance with us sanctions . "
iran relies heavily on german companies and their know-how , because a large part of the iranian industry depends on parts supplied by germany .
such is the need for german expertise that iranian vice foreign secretary mehdi safari specifically asked for more german investment in a recent statement : " we could easily have an exchange of commodities with germany which could total more than 20 billion euros , " he said .
as way of incentive , the iranian government has loosened investment laws and has privatized state enterprises so that foreign investors can take part .
by focusing on selling its energy sector , iran hopes to attract foreign investment in its oil and gas enterprises .
while iran has the second largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world , the country , hobbled by a lack of refineries and creaking infrastructure , still has to import gasoline .
china , russia picking up the slack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has stepped in to provide the goods germany wo n't while german investment in iran dropped by around 15 percent in the last year , china 's investments in the country are booming .
germany 's trade volume with iran totals around 3.5 billion euros , in comparison to china 's reported 30 billion dollars - an increase of 60 percent as compared to the previous year .
though the lion 's share of china 's profitable business with iran comes from its strong exports of consumer goods , some say there 's one overriding factor underpinning china 's success in the country .
" china , just like the russians , do n't take any notice of sanctions , " said daniel bernbeck , the head of the german-iranian chamber of commerce in teheran .
russia has doubled its trade with iran - much to the annoyance of european enterprises .
" if some countries abide by the restrictions of trade under the un sanctions and others do n't , then the sanction policy causes nothing but an imbalance in trade , " lamented felix neugart of the german chamber of industry and commerce .
domestic and international pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has promised hardship for those dealing with iran it 's not just the trade embargo on iran imposed by the un security council that 's hurting european businesses in iran .
the direct and indirect fallout of sanctions applied by the european union and germany are equally responsible for the plunge in profits .
for example , german companies who continue to export to iran can expect to have difficulties getting credit .
exports are also subject to such stringent controls that it 's difficult to make deliveries on time .
german companies also suffer from the fact that the accounts of the biggest iranian banks have been frozen and that german banks have exited iran .
there is also the question of which market is more important : iran or the united states ?
pursuing or maintaining trade links with iran runs the risk of angering the us , which has taken the lead in pressurizing european firms to sever trade links with iran .
european companies that continue to trade with iran can expect a hard time in the united states .
sidestepping sanctions still , experts say trade with iran is n't entirely impossible and some european companies do find a way to dodge un sanctions .
" the money just flows via third countries and most of the transactions take place in hard cash , " said bernbeck who lives in teheran .
in such a secretive climate , the focus is on a discreet network of middlemen who literally accept suitcases with wads of money and smuggle it out of the country .
" they 're medieval methods of doing business , " said bernbeck , who said he withdrew money from his bank in germany to pay his yearly rent in cash to his landlady in teheran , usually in cash in a bar .
" if a plane crashes on its way to tehran from germany , then the loss of the luggage would be more expensive than the loss of the plane , " he said .
change in political approach would help trade business federations describe the current policy towards iran as " paranoia combined with hysteria . "
though german exports to iran rose slightly this year , experts say in the long-run there will be a major shift in iran 's trading partners as the country looks for other investors and business players .

it calls the deal a " great success " for the un , the german government and the " excellent " german mediator himself . the paper does not name the mediator , but middle east news reports have regularly identified him as gerhard conrad , the bnd officer who was assigned to broker the previous israel-hezbollah prisoner swap in 2004 .
he is respected and trusted by both sides and by the un . the deal is expected to come to fruition on wednesday morning at rosh ha 'nikra / naquora , the only border crossing between israel and lebanon , with the handover of the bodies of two israeli soldiers , eldad regev and ehud goldwasser , who were seized in july 2006 . israelis confirmed dead according to hezbollah sources , the five lebanese prisoners set to be released have arrived at the israeli side of the border crossing .
hezbollah also said wednesday morning that the coffins of the two dead israelis had already been handed over to red cross officials at the border , confirming for the first time that the soldiers had indeed died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regev and goldwasser are ded " today we are handing to the international committee of the red cross two coffins , " senior hezbollah official wafik safa told reporters at naqoura , the lebanese side of the border .
" we are seeing that they are both dead . " red cross officials checked the coffins inside a tent on the lebanese side of the naqoura crossing after which they were taken to the israeli side of the border to be handed over to red cross delegates there . german agent conrad earlier had met with lebanese officials and then with israeli officials on each side of the border , informing them of the soldiers condition . the families of the two israeli soldiers reacted with sorrow to the news that they were dead . " many years of worry , suffering and great pain came to an end today , when unfortunately we received our sons as fallen soldiers and not as living sons , " shmulik el-grably , a spokesman for the families , told dpa news agency . he especially thanked conrad , whom he said the families had met in secret several times , for his " relentless efforts . " german mediation to continue the document notes that the negotiated swap is not the end of bnd mediation , since germany has promised israel continuing assistance in finding out what happened to other missing israeli personnel , as has already been provided for the past 15 years . however , the german program apparently does not extend to the case of gilad shilat , the israeli soldier kidnapped two years ago by the hamas movement , which controls the gaza strip , the sources said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 16.07.2008 volkswagen to set up $ 1 billion car plant in us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's largest carmaker is stepping on the gas in the us market volkswagen , europe 's biggest car maker , has said it plans to build a 620 million euros -lrb- $ 1billion -rrb- factory in chattanooga , tennessee in a bid to boost the german automaker 's lagging us sales . the site , one of at least two in the us south that volkswagen examined , was picked by volkswagen group 's supervisory board .
the plan calls for the first cars to roll off the assembly line in 2011 . europe 's biggest carmaker has failed for years to achieve profits in the united states , where asian competitors have regularly upstaged its range of mass-produced front-wheel drive cars .
" the united states is an important market for our volume strategy , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying .
" volkswagen will be extremely active there , " he pledged , the same day that us giant general motors warned of " significant " second quarter losses and unveiled a fresh restructuring and cost-cutting program to battle slumping sales .
" we will be selling 800,000 volkswagens per year in the us by 2018 , and this new site will play a key role , " winterkorn forecast .
vw had been searching for the location of an assembly line to protect it from a relentless rise of the euro that has affected profits in north america .
making cars in the eurozone and selling them for dollars has cost european automakers dearly .
" this , along with our growth strategy , is a pre-requisite for the economic success of the company in the dollar region , " winterkorn added .
earlier tuesday , the single european currency set a new record above $ 1.60 as the greenback was hit by mounting fears over the stormy us economic outlook , dealers said .
vw to employ 2,000 local workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw will continue its policy of hiring a local workforce the vw statement added that the automaker also wanted us customers to perceive it as a domestic manufacturer .
vw said it would hire around 2,000 workers to work at the chattanooga plant .
the german auto giant already has a plant in mexico but it does not make enough cars to supply all of north america , where vw currently has a market share of around two percent .
the group wants to at least triple that figure within 10 years and said tuesday it would produce a new midsized sedan " tailored specifically to the us market " at the new plant .
vw has already begun to restructure activities in the united states , which have posted losses for several years .
in addition to vehicle production , distribution and marketing activities are covered by the measures .
general motors forecast significant losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes have hit general motors ' productivity this year in chicago , gm said that strikes , a soft market and an " adverse vehicle segment mix " would result in a significant second-quarter loss .
those losses would be deepened as a result of " significant charges " gm expected to report related to a massive restructuring program of its own initiated in 2005 .
gm has already cut its us workforce by more that 40,000 employees as it shuttered plants in the wake of losses which have topped $ 54 billion since 2005 .
investors welcomed the news and shares in the german group closed on tuesday with a gain of 2.34 percent at 174.23 euros .
the dax index of leading shares was off by 1.91 percent overall at 6,081.70 points , the first time it had fallen below 6,100 points since october 2006 .
other german carmakers to join in volkswagen is not the only german company to increase its production output in the united states .
by 2012 , luxury automaker bmw plans to invest a billion dollars in its distribution network and its plant in south carolina will increase output by 50 percent to 240,000 vehicles per year , news agency afp reported .
stuttgart-based daimler already has several factories in the united states , in particular for heavy trucks , and its car plant in alabama rolls out around 180,000 units a year .
in all , german companies have a us market share of around six percent with more than 900,000 units sold per year , of which only around one quarter are built on the continent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 16.07.2008 european rights activists slam guantanamo bay conditions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the video of the guantanamo inmate begging for help has sparked outrage european human rights activists have expressed alarm about a graphic video released this week showing a young canadian inmate at guantanamo bay weeping and calling out for help . a grainy seven-and-a-half hour video released by the lawyers of the youngest detainee held at the us military prison in cuba shows omar khadr weeping and begging for help .
" you do n't care about me , " khadr tells his interrogators .
" nobody cares about me . "
indeed , when khadr complains that the interrogators have not helped his case and asks to be returned home to canada , he is told , " we ca n't do anything for you . "
the video , shot over the course of four days in february 2003 when khadr was 16 and grilled by officials from the canadian security intelligence service spy agency is the first real insight into the conditions at guantanamo bay which have been slammed by human rights activists .
" for me that video is just the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang kaleck , general secretary of the european center for constitutional and human rights . " i 'm not an emotional person , but it 's easy when you watch that footage to fill in the blanks about what you 're not seeing . "
the united states is holding about 265 prisoners at guantanamo bay . 21-year-old omar khadr , the only western national among them , is charged with killing a us medic in afghanistan in 2002 at the age of 15 .
" this tape shows the inhumanity of what goes on at guantanamo , " said ferdinand muggenthaler , americas expert at amnesty international germany .
" though the video itself does n't show torture outright , it gives us an image of what happens there - the methods that interrogators are using . "
canada in violation of un protocol ?
in one excerpt , these methods include interrogators showing little sympathy for khadr 's myriad medical concerns .
" you look like you 're doing well to me , " says the interrogator .
" i 'm not a doctor but i think you 're getting good medical care . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .
if germany was able to secure the release of their nationals , canada should be able to do the same . "
canadian prime minister stephen harper does n't seem to agree , however .
though a canadian federal judge said khadr 's treatment at guantanamo bay violated international laws on human rights , the prime minister 's office held firm tuesday in its decision not to ask for khadr 's repatriation . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court injunction , heard by the state court in kassel late on monday , forced the german national olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- to scratch poleska - who finished second in the qualifying trial - in favor of third-placed bernhardt , much to the chagrin of dosb president thomas bach .
bernhardt finished third in the 200 meters breaststroke at the german national championships in april , just failing to get a top two spot needed to make the team for beijing .
rather than graciously facing the fact that she had come up just short , bernhardt ruthlessly exposed a footnote law within the rules of the german championships to force the hand of the dosb .
rival poleska accused of breaking club rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poleska says she did n't race as a club member in the us the court in kessel heard that poleska - a born-and-bred german , a national champion and olympic bronze medalist from athens 2004 - had previously raced for the coral springs swimming club in florida and not a german club .
german swimming federation rules allow athletes to compete for foreign college or school swimming teams but not foreign clubs .
" i 've never seen anything like this before - an athlete trying to box her way onto the team because of a technicality , a mistake by a colleague , " bach told reporters .
poleska said she had done nothing wrong and was not a member of any club when she swam in the florida meets .
" i see my position as crystal clear from a legal point of view , " she said .
" i 'm not afraid at all that i 'll miss the olympics . "
germany 's olympic swimming coach orjan madsen was also sure that poleska and not bernhardt would be representing germany in beijing .
" ' the fact is that anne was nominated by the dosb and already has her olympic team clothes that she 'll be traveling to beijing in , " he said .
michael wolski , a lawyer and chairman of bernhardt 's club sg frankfurt which filed the legal challenge on her behalf , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung he had presented documents showing poleska took part in 10 club meets for coral springs .
" i can not imagine she did not know the rules , " wolski was quoted by the paper as saying .
" everyone knows those rules . "
this is not the first time that national german law has stood in the way of a fair outcome as viewed from a sporting perspective .
former gdr swimmer astrid strauss was banned for failing a doping test , but continued to race inside a reunified germany after her international ban because a judge decided it only fair .
bernhardt 's inclusion could lead to more court action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhardt can expect little support in the german team an executive board meeting will decide on july 20 if another swimmer will be pushed out of the german team by the decision forced by bernhardt 's undeserved olympic selection .
if this were to happen , bernhardt could well expect to spend more time in court than in the pool as the board 's decision would surely be the subject of a legal claim by the displaced swimmer .
if bernhardt does fly to beijing , it 's unlikely that she will be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the squad , especially those on the swimming team who will know that the third-best , and not second best , swimmer made the team and after a dirty legal challenge that went against all unwritten rules of sportsmanship .
more drama could follow if she is allowed in the squad .
olympic rules state that each country can only field two 200 meter breaststroke competitors .
with bernhardt making it three , she could cause further ill-feeling by getting the nod ahead of one of the other swimmers .
what is more likely in this scenario is that bernhardt will be forced to sit on the bench . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the conclusion of the conference is that there is only limited scope for reducing " emissions " in the industrial sector and the eu climate package needs improvement in key areas , " said the ministry in a statement . the ministry was particularly critical of the eu 's goal to cut the quota of emissions trading permits by 21 percent , compared to 2005 levels , saying this would cost germany both jobs and growth .
as a major burner of fossil-fuels , which cause unwanted co2 emissions , germany would be especially hard hit by the plan , added the ministry . the statement also pointed out that an emissions trading program would result in a price hike for products that are useful in reaching climate goals , such as insulation glass and insulating construction materials . no more room for cuts , says economics ministry " due to exploding oil and gas prices , further measures to achieve climate goals should be considered only with great caution , " read the statement .
" rising energy prices are already a strong incentive to investment in renewable energies , energy savings and energy efficiency . " germany 's industry has already contributed extensively to reducing greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 , despite economic growth , but has little leeway to do more , it added . earlier this month , the eu proposed a legally-binding bloc-wide initiative to slash energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
eu environment ministers have suggested the use of biofuels as a way to cut carbon emissions by 35 percent in the short-term and by 50 percent by the year 2015 . eu legislators this month also approved an emissions trading plan for the aviation industry , which airlines say will drive up the price of flights . but as long a key polluters like the united states , china and india do n't implement similar strategies to reduce emissions , the eu 's efforts wo n't have a significant impact on global climate change , concluded the economics ministry . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan calls for the first cars to roll off the assembly line in 2011 . europe 's biggest carmaker has failed for years to achieve profits in the united states , where asian competitors have regularly upstaged its range of mass-produced front-wheel drive cars .
" the united states is an important market for our volume strategy , " volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn was quoted as saying .
" volkswagen will be extremely active there , " he pledged , the same day that us giant general motors warned of " significant " second quarter losses and unveiled a fresh restructuring and cost-cutting program to battle slumping sales .
" we will be selling 800,000 volkswagens per year in the us by 2018 , and this new site will play a key role , " winterkorn forecast .
vw had been searching for the location of an assembly line to protect it from a relentless rise of the euro that has affected profits in north america .
making cars in the eurozone and selling them for dollars has cost european automakers dearly .
" this , along with our growth strategy , is a pre-requisite for the economic success of the company in the dollar region , " winterkorn added .

vw said it would hire around 2,000 workers to work at the chattanooga plant .
the german auto giant already has a plant in mexico but it does not make enough cars to supply all of north america , where vw currently has a market share of around two percent .
the group wants to at least triple that figure within 10 years and said tuesday it would produce a new midsized sedan " tailored specifically to the us market " at the new plant .

those losses would be deepened as a result of " significant charges " gm expected to report related to a massive restructuring program of its own initiated in 2005 .
gm has already cut its us workforce by more that 40,000 employees as it shuttered plants in the wake of losses which have topped $ 54 billion since 2005 .
investors welcomed the news and shares in the german group closed on tuesday with a gain of 2.34 percent at 174.23 euros .
the dax index of leading shares was off by 1.91 percent overall at 6,081.70 points , the first time it had fallen below 6,100 points since october 2006 .

the creators wanted to make an ironic statement about the tyrants but not everyone appreciates the joke . the game , called das fuehrer quartett , is based on a popular german children 's card game called quartett , but with a difference .
in the traditional game , the cards feature cars or flowers or even beer brands , which players try to collect from their opponents .
in this new version , the cards present pictures and information on notorious historical figures such as joseph stalin , francisco franco and adolf hitler . " we did n't really have a clear political idea in mind with the game , " said volker oppmann of onkel & onkel , the berlin-based publishing house behind the deck .

the creators wanted to make an ironic statement about the tyrants but not everyone appreciates the joke . the game , called das fuehrer quartett , is based on a popular german children 's card game called quartett , but with a difference .
in the traditional game , the cards feature cars or flowers or even beer brands , which players try to collect from their opponents .
in this new version , the cards present pictures and information on notorious historical figures such as joseph stalin , francisco franco and adolf hitler . " we did n't really have a clear political idea in mind with the game , " said volker oppmann of onkel & onkel , the berlin-based publishing house behind the deck .
" but we did want to take away some of the power that these figures still have .
when you can laugh at them , you do n't fear them as much . " each card features one dictator , the country he ruled , his educational / vocational background and how long he was in power , among other factoids .
the cards stick to the historical record and also present information that might be less well known , oppmann , 33 , said . for example , the card featuring stalin explains that while in school he was repeatedly caught reading material that had been banned .
the card on romania 's nicolae ceausescu reveals that he had a soft spot for vlad the impaler , said to have been the inspiration for bram stoker 's " dracula . " lighter touch the cards have an ironic tone , and the authors use wordplay in some of the descriptive categories or have a lighter touch when presenting additional information about a figure .
for augusto pinochet , the card says he destroyed a democratic system with help from the us , but rebuilt another one later , only to be toppled by it .
" somehow stupid , " it says . " i think we succeeded in finding the right mix of seriousness and fun , " said oppmann . bildunterschrift : the public appears to appreciate the game 's ironic tone ; the decks have been selling fast .
of the first print run of 2,000 , oppmann said more than half are sold out and a second printing is planned . but not everyone thinks presenting war criminals as slightly risible figures is a positive thing . tasteless and inappropriate ? berlin senator ehrhart körting , 66 , called the deck tasteless .
historian arnulf baring said it played down the enormity of the crimes committed . " the further back the third reich recedes in history , the more bizarre the way it is dealt with becomes , " he told the bild newspaper . oppmann rejects the critique , pointing out that when the card game was released at this year 's leipzig book fair , employees from the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , a democratic political education organization , found the cards hilarious and ordered five decks right away . " if these people can laugh at it , i 'm not worried , " he said . in fact , the goal of das fuehrer quartett , unlike in traditional quartett , is not to gather as many cards and dictators as you can .
in this version , the winner is the first person to rid him or herself of all these despots . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 16.07.2008 european rights activists slam guantanamo bay conditions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the video of the guantanamo inmate begging for help has sparked outrage european human rights activists have expressed alarm about a graphic video released this week showing a young canadian inmate at guantanamo bay weeping and calling out for help . a grainy seven-and-a-half hour video released by the lawyers of the youngest detainee held at the us military prison in cuba shows omar khadr weeping and begging for help .
" you do n't care about me , " khadr tells his interrogators .
" nobody cares about me . "
indeed , when khadr complains that the interrogators have not helped his case and asks to be returned home to canada , he is told , " we ca n't do anything for you . "
the video , shot over the course of four days in february 2003 when khadr was 16 and grilled by officials from the canadian security intelligence service spy agency is the first real insight into the conditions at guantanamo bay which have been slammed by human rights activists .
" for me that video is just the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang kaleck , general secretary of the european center for constitutional and human rights . " i 'm not an emotional person , but it 's easy when you watch that footage to fill in the blanks about what you 're not seeing . "
the united states is holding about 265 prisoners at guantanamo bay . 21-year-old omar khadr , the only western national among them , is charged with killing a us medic in afghanistan in 2002 at the age of 15 .
" this tape shows the inhumanity of what goes on at guantanamo , " said ferdinand muggenthaler , americas expert at amnesty international germany .
" though the video itself does n't show torture outright , it gives us an image of what happens there - the methods that interrogators are using . "
canada in violation of un protocol ?
in one excerpt , these methods include interrogators showing little sympathy for khadr 's myriad medical concerns .
" you look like you 're doing well to me , " says the interrogator .
" i 'm not a doctor but i think you 're getting good medical care . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .
if germany was able to secure the release of their nationals , canada should be able to do the same . "
canadian prime minister stephen harper does n't seem to agree , however .
though a canadian federal judge said khadr 's treatment at guantanamo bay violated international laws on human rights , the prime minister 's office held firm tuesday in its decision not to ask for khadr 's repatriation . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court injunction , heard by the state court in kassel late on monday , forced the german national olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- to scratch poleska - who finished second in the qualifying trial - in favor of third-placed bernhardt , much to the chagrin of dosb president thomas bach .
bernhardt finished third in the 200 meters breaststroke at the german national championships in april , just failing to get a top two spot needed to make the team for beijing .
rather than graciously facing the fact that she had come up just short , bernhardt ruthlessly exposed a footnote law within the rules of the german championships to force the hand of the dosb .
rival poleska accused of breaking club rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poleska says she did n't race as a club member in the us the court in kessel heard that poleska - a born-and-bred german , a national champion and olympic bronze medalist from athens 2004 - had previously raced for the coral springs swimming club in florida and not a german club .
german swimming federation rules allow athletes to compete for foreign college or school swimming teams but not foreign clubs .
" i 've never seen anything like this before - an athlete trying to box her way onto the team because of a technicality , a mistake by a colleague , " bach told reporters .
poleska said she had done nothing wrong and was not a member of any club when she swam in the florida meets .
" i see my position as crystal clear from a legal point of view , " she said .
" i 'm not afraid at all that i 'll miss the olympics . "
germany 's olympic swimming coach orjan madsen was also sure that poleska and not bernhardt would be representing germany in beijing .
" ' the fact is that anne was nominated by the dosb and already has her olympic team clothes that she 'll be traveling to beijing in , " he said .
michael wolski , a lawyer and chairman of bernhardt 's club sg frankfurt which filed the legal challenge on her behalf , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung he had presented documents showing poleska took part in 10 club meets for coral springs .
" i can not imagine she did not know the rules , " wolski was quoted by the paper as saying .
" everyone knows those rules . "
this is not the first time that national german law has stood in the way of a fair outcome as viewed from a sporting perspective .
former gdr swimmer astrid strauss was banned for failing a doping test , but continued to race inside a reunified germany after her international ban because a judge decided it only fair .
bernhardt 's inclusion could lead to more court action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhardt can expect little support in the german team an executive board meeting will decide on july 20 if another swimmer will be pushed out of the german team by the decision forced by bernhardt 's undeserved olympic selection .
if this were to happen , bernhardt could well expect to spend more time in court than in the pool as the board 's decision would surely be the subject of a legal claim by the displaced swimmer .
if bernhardt does fly to beijing , it 's unlikely that she will be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the squad , especially those on the swimming team who will know that the third-best , and not second best , swimmer made the team and after a dirty legal challenge that went against all unwritten rules of sportsmanship .
more drama could follow if she is allowed in the squad .
olympic rules state that each country can only field two 200 meter breaststroke competitors .
with bernhardt making it three , she could cause further ill-feeling by getting the nod ahead of one of the other swimmers .

rival poleska accused of breaking club rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poleska says she did n't race as a club member in the us the court in kessel heard that poleska - a born-and-bred german , a national champion and olympic bronze medalist from athens 2004 - had previously raced for the coral springs swimming club in florida and not a german club .
german swimming federation rules allow athletes to compete for foreign college or school swimming teams but not foreign clubs .
" i 've never seen anything like this before - an athlete trying to box her way onto the team because of a technicality , a mistake by a colleague , " bach told reporters .
poleska said she had done nothing wrong and was not a member of any club when she swam in the florida meets .
" i see my position as crystal clear from a legal point of view , " she said .
" i 'm not afraid at all that i 'll miss the olympics . "
germany 's olympic swimming coach orjan madsen was also sure that poleska and not bernhardt would be representing germany in beijing .
" ' the fact is that anne was nominated by the dosb and already has her olympic team clothes that she 'll be traveling to beijing in , " he said .
michael wolski , a lawyer and chairman of bernhardt 's club sg frankfurt which filed the legal challenge on her behalf , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung he had presented documents showing poleska took part in 10 club meets for coral springs .
" i can not imagine she did not know the rules , " wolski was quoted by the paper as saying .
" everyone knows those rules . "
this is not the first time that national german law has stood in the way of a fair outcome as viewed from a sporting perspective .
former gdr swimmer astrid strauss was banned for failing a doping test , but continued to race inside a reunified germany after her international ban because a judge decided it only fair .
bernhardt 's inclusion could lead to more court action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhardt can expect little support in the german team an executive board meeting will decide on july 20 if another swimmer will be pushed out of the german team by the decision forced by bernhardt 's undeserved olympic selection .
if this were to happen , bernhardt could well expect to spend more time in court than in the pool as the board 's decision would surely be the subject of a legal claim by the displaced swimmer .
if bernhardt does fly to beijing , it 's unlikely that she will be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the squad , especially those on the swimming team who will know that the third-best , and not second best , swimmer made the team and after a dirty legal challenge that went against all unwritten rules of sportsmanship .
more drama could follow if she is allowed in the squad .
olympic rules state that each country can only field two 200 meter breaststroke competitors .
with bernhardt making it three , she could cause further ill-feeling by getting the nod ahead of one of the other swimmers .
what is more likely in this scenario is that bernhardt will be forced to sit on the bench . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the conclusion of the conference is that there is only limited scope for reducing " emissions " in the industrial sector and the eu climate package needs improvement in key areas , " said the ministry in a statement . the ministry was particularly critical of the eu 's goal to cut the quota of emissions trading permits by 21 percent , compared to 2005 levels , saying this would cost germany both jobs and growth .
as a major burner of fossil-fuels , which cause unwanted co2 emissions , germany would be especially hard hit by the plan , added the ministry . the statement also pointed out that an emissions trading program would result in a price hike for products that are useful in reaching climate goals , such as insulation glass and insulating construction materials . no more room for cuts , says economics ministry " due to exploding oil and gas prices , further measures to achieve climate goals should be considered only with great caution , " read the statement .
" rising energy prices are already a strong incentive to investment in renewable energies , energy savings and energy efficiency . " germany 's industry has already contributed extensively to reducing greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 , despite economic growth , but has little leeway to do more , it added . earlier this month , the eu proposed a legally-binding bloc-wide initiative to slash energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 .

the latest was french oil group total which said in a statement it was withdrawing from the country .
british-dutch group shell publicly pulled out from a gas project in iran in may .
the iranian state is no longer a shareholder in german steel manufacturer thyssen-krupp and germany 's deutsche bank ended its 40-year association with iran .
iran seeks to court german investment the economic sanctions applied against iran have sparked much criticism in the business community .
german companies are among those who feel that trade restrictions with the islamic republic are harmful not only to iran .
however , some companies continue to work with iran despite the sanctions and profit from the refusal of others to trade with tehran .
those companies which remain in business in iran do so quietly .
german engineering giant siemens continues to operate in the country but insists that its business in iran accounts for less one percent of its turnover .
europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen says it still plans to expand its assembly-line cooperation in the country but insists " there 's nothing big " in the pipeline , according to a company spokesman .
oil giant bp has vowed it will not be involved in iran and says any future engagement " will be in accordance with us sanctions . "
iran relies heavily on german companies and their know-how , because a large part of the iranian industry depends on parts supplied by germany .
such is the need for german expertise that iranian vice foreign secretary mehdi safari specifically asked for more german investment in a recent statement : " we could easily have an exchange of commodities with germany which could total more than 20 billion euros , " he said .
as way of incentive , the iranian government has loosened investment laws and has privatized state enterprises so that foreign investors can take part .
by focusing on selling its energy sector , iran hopes to attract foreign investment in its oil and gas enterprises .
while iran has the second largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world , the country , hobbled by a lack of refineries and creaking infrastructure , still has to import gasoline .
china , russia picking up the slack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has stepped in to provide the goods germany wo n't while german investment in iran dropped by around 15 percent in the last year , china 's investments in the country are booming .
germany 's trade volume with iran totals around 3.5 billion euros , in comparison to china 's reported 30 billion dollars - an increase of 60 percent as compared to the previous year .
though the lion 's share of china 's profitable business with iran comes from its strong exports of consumer goods , some say there 's one overriding factor underpinning china 's success in the country .
" china , just like the russians , do n't take any notice of sanctions , " said daniel bernbeck , the head of the german-iranian chamber of commerce in teheran .
russia has doubled its trade with iran - much to the annoyance of european enterprises .
" if some countries abide by the restrictions of trade under the un sanctions and others do n't , then the sanction policy causes nothing but an imbalance in trade , " lamented felix neugart of the german chamber of industry and commerce .
domestic and international pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has promised hardship for those dealing with iran it 's not just the trade embargo on iran imposed by the un security council that 's hurting european businesses in iran .
the direct and indirect fallout of sanctions applied by the european union and germany are equally responsible for the plunge in profits .
for example , german companies who continue to export to iran can expect to have difficulties getting credit .
exports are also subject to such stringent controls that it 's difficult to make deliveries on time .
german companies also suffer from the fact that the accounts of the biggest iranian banks have been frozen and that german banks have exited iran .
there is also the question of which market is more important : iran or the united states ?
pursuing or maintaining trade links with iran runs the risk of angering the us , which has taken the lead in pressurizing european firms to sever trade links with iran .
european companies that continue to trade with iran can expect a hard time in the united states .
sidestepping sanctions still , experts say trade with iran is n't entirely impossible and some european companies do find a way to dodge un sanctions .
" the money just flows via third countries and most of the transactions take place in hard cash , " said bernbeck who lives in teheran .
in such a secretive climate , the focus is on a discreet network of middlemen who literally accept suitcases with wads of money and smuggle it out of the country .
" they 're medieval methods of doing business , " said bernbeck , who said he withdrew money from his bank in germany to pay his yearly rent in cash to his landlady in teheran , usually in cash in a bar .
" if a plane crashes on its way to tehran from germany , then the loss of the luggage would be more expensive than the loss of the plane , " he said .
change in political approach would help trade business federations describe the current policy towards iran as " paranoia combined with hysteria . "
though german exports to iran rose slightly this year , experts say in the long-run there will be a major shift in iran 's trading partners as the country looks for other investors and business players .
" germany certainly stands to lose in such a situation , " said henner fuertig of the leibniz institute for global and regional studies .
at present , saudi arabia is a favorite trading partner of the iranians .
the gulf nation has offered russia wide-ranging arms deals if in return moscow deepens cooperation with iran .
the future for trade with iran is as unstable as the international relationship with tehran .
" one should not hold on to the hope that iran will come around through sanctions alone , " said johannes reissner of the german foundation for science and politics .
a serious debate with - and about - iran must be restarted without political brinkmanship , he added .
many other experts support reissner 's view that the removal of sanctions and a return to diplomatic discussion without threats would be more constructive .
bildunterschrift : face-to-face negotiations between the eu and iran failed and have yet to be restarted " it 's not like we did n't talk to iran , " said one diplomat close to the west 's negotiations who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity .
" but the carrot and stick approach did n't work .
now we 've worked on both levels , " he said , referring to offering iran a repreive from economic and financial sanctions in exchange for freezing its enrichment activites .
while the rhetoric increases , the hidden trade with iran still blossoms .
the industrial parts , which germany refuses to deliver , now come from england .
asia is also scrambling to catch up with the west by exporting industrial know-how .
us trade increases as washington pressures others and the us is n't far behind .
us exports to iran have hugely increased during the bush administration 's two terms , showing stronger growth than under any other us government .
us goods to the value of $ 150 million were shipped into iran in 2007 alone .
all of which rankles with european investors who feel the pressure not to deal with tehran emanating from washington .
meanwhile , german companies continue to bail out of iran .
even a german manufacturer of faucets for bathtubs has discontinued his long-standing relationship with an iranian customer - because of the fear that the us could find out that he trades with iran .
this is absurd , criticizes daniel bernbeck .

the creators wanted to make an ironic statement about the tyrants but not everyone appreciates the joke . the game , called das fuehrer quartett , is based on a popular german children 's card game called quartett , but with a difference .
in the traditional game , the cards feature cars or flowers or even beer brands , which players try to collect from their opponents .
in this new version , the cards present pictures and information on notorious historical figures such as joseph stalin , francisco franco and adolf hitler . " we did n't really have a clear political idea in mind with the game , " said volker oppmann of onkel & onkel , the berlin-based publishing house behind the deck .
" but we did want to take away some of the power that these figures still have .
when you can laugh at them , you do n't fear them as much . " each card features one dictator , the country he ruled , his educational / vocational background and how long he was in power , among other factoids .
the cards stick to the historical record and also present information that might be less well known , oppmann , 33 , said . for example , the card featuring stalin explains that while in school he was repeatedly caught reading material that had been banned .
the card on romania 's nicolae ceausescu reveals that he had a soft spot for vlad the impaler , said to have been the inspiration for bram stoker 's " dracula . " lighter touch the cards have an ironic tone , and the authors use wordplay in some of the descriptive categories or have a lighter touch when presenting additional information about a figure .
for augusto pinochet , the card says he destroyed a democratic system with help from the us , but rebuilt another one later , only to be toppled by it .
" somehow stupid , " it says . " i think we succeeded in finding the right mix of seriousness and fun , " said oppmann . bildunterschrift : the public appears to appreciate the game 's ironic tone ; the decks have been selling fast .
of the first print run of 2,000 , oppmann said more than half are sold out and a second printing is planned . but not everyone thinks presenting war criminals as slightly risible figures is a positive thing . tasteless and inappropriate ? berlin senator ehrhart körting , 66 , called the deck tasteless .
historian arnulf baring said it played down the enormity of the crimes committed . " the further back the third reich recedes in history , the more bizarre the way it is dealt with becomes , " he told the bild newspaper . oppmann rejects the critique , pointing out that when the card game was released at this year 's leipzig book fair , employees from the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , a democratic political education organization , found the cards hilarious and ordered five decks right away . " if these people can laugh at it , i 'm not worried , " he said . in fact , the goal of das fuehrer quartett , unlike in traditional quartett , is not to gather as many cards and dictators as you can .

the cards stick to the historical record and also present information that might be less well known , oppmann , 33 , said . for example , the card featuring stalin explains that while in school he was repeatedly caught reading material that had been banned .
the card on romania 's nicolae ceausescu reveals that he had a soft spot for vlad the impaler , said to have been the inspiration for bram stoker 's " dracula . " lighter touch the cards have an ironic tone , and the authors use wordplay in some of the descriptive categories or have a lighter touch when presenting additional information about a figure .
for augusto pinochet , the card says he destroyed a democratic system with help from the us , but rebuilt another one later , only to be toppled by it .
" somehow stupid , " it says . " i think we succeeded in finding the right mix of seriousness and fun , " said oppmann . bildunterschrift : the public appears to appreciate the game 's ironic tone ; the decks have been selling fast .
of the first print run of 2,000 , oppmann said more than half are sold out and a second printing is planned . but not everyone thinks presenting war criminals as slightly risible figures is a positive thing . tasteless and inappropriate ? berlin senator ehrhart körting , 66 , called the deck tasteless .
historian arnulf baring said it played down the enormity of the crimes committed . " the further back the third reich recedes in history , the more bizarre the way it is dealt with becomes , " he told the bild newspaper . oppmann rejects the critique , pointing out that when the card game was released at this year 's leipzig book fair , employees from the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , a democratic political education organization , found the cards hilarious and ordered five decks right away . " if these people can laugh at it , i 'm not worried , " he said . in fact , the goal of das fuehrer quartett , unlike in traditional quartett , is not to gather as many cards and dictators as you can .
in this version , the winner is the first person to rid him or herself of all these despots . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was the third time this year that the three percent threshold was reached , " a destatis statement said .
the european central bank 's inflation target is just below 2.0 percent in the medium term .
food and fuel represented more than half of the annualized global price increase and corresponded to around 20 percent of all household spending , the report added .
the overall cost of fuels had leapt by 61.9 percent on the year , with motor fuels gaining 15.0 percent .
if energy was excluded , " the year-on-year rate of price increase would have been 1.9 percent , " the statement said .
food prices showing considerable gains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel prices are increasing at a dramatic rate general food prices jumped by 7.6 percent in june from the same month a year earlier , with dairy products showing a gain of 18.9 percent .
the cost of breads and cereals rose by 9.1 percent , but that of fish and seafood by just 1.2 percent .
prices for durable consumer goods fell meanwhile , with computer equipment down by 16.4 percent on the year and tv sets costing 18.9 percent less on average .
the cost of services rose by 1.6 percent , in large part owing to rents , which account for 20 percent of the total calculation , destatis said .
but it nonetheless pointed out that " the price trend for rents has remained below the level of the consumer price index for a considerable time and thus has had a dampening effect on inflation .

" it was the third time this year that the three percent threshold was reached , " a destatis statement said .
the european central bank 's inflation target is just below 2.0 percent in the medium term .
food and fuel represented more than half of the annualized global price increase and corresponded to around 20 percent of all household spending , the report added .
the overall cost of fuels had leapt by 61.9 percent on the year , with motor fuels gaining 15.0 percent .
if energy was excluded , " the year-on-year rate of price increase would have been 1.9 percent , " the statement said .
food prices showing considerable gains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel prices are increasing at a dramatic rate general food prices jumped by 7.6 percent in june from the same month a year earlier , with dairy products showing a gain of 18.9 percent .
the cost of breads and cereals rose by 9.1 percent , but that of fish and seafood by just 1.2 percent .
prices for durable consumer goods fell meanwhile , with computer equipment down by 16.4 percent on the year and tv sets costing 18.9 percent less on average .
the cost of services rose by 1.6 percent , in large part owing to rents , which account for 20 percent of the total calculation , destatis said .
but it nonetheless pointed out that " the price trend for rents has remained below the level of the consumer price index for a considerable time and thus has had a dampening effect on inflation .

" the conclusion of the conference is that there is only limited scope for reducing " emissions " in the industrial sector and the eu climate package needs improvement in key areas , " said the ministry in a statement . the ministry was particularly critical of the eu 's goal to cut the quota of emissions trading permits by 21 percent , compared to 2005 levels , saying this would cost germany both jobs and growth .
as a major burner of fossil-fuels , which cause unwanted co2 emissions , germany would be especially hard hit by the plan , added the ministry . the statement also pointed out that an emissions trading program would result in a price hike for products that are useful in reaching climate goals , such as insulation glass and insulating construction materials . no more room for cuts , says economics ministry " due to exploding oil and gas prices , further measures to achieve climate goals should be considered only with great caution , " read the statement .
" rising energy prices are already a strong incentive to investment in renewable energies , energy savings and energy efficiency . " germany 's industry has already contributed extensively to reducing greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 , despite economic growth , but has little leeway to do more , it added . earlier this month , the eu proposed a legally-binding bloc-wide initiative to slash energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
eu environment ministers have suggested the use of biofuels as a way to cut carbon emissions by 35 percent in the short-term and by 50 percent by the year 2015 . eu legislators this month also approved an emissions trading plan for the aviation industry , which airlines say will drive up the price of flights . but as long a key polluters like the united states , china and india do n't implement similar strategies to reduce emissions , the eu 's efforts wo n't have a significant impact on global climate change , concluded the economics ministry . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but , he added , not in the sense of providing instruction , but giving support for the process of building a society based on the rule of law . schroeder , who visited china six times and russia 15 times as chancellor from 1998 to 2005 , never spoke publicly about human rights . schroeder had special criticism for chancellor angela merkel 's cdu / csu bloc of german conservatives in parliament for their new strategy paper on asia which calls for a break with the current china policy .
the former chancellor said the paper had caused " a great deal of damage on the foreign-policy front " for its " aggressive anti-chinese rhetoric " and that it had irritated chinese leaders and many in the society at large . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest was french oil group total which said in a statement it was withdrawing from the country .
british-dutch group shell publicly pulled out from a gas project in iran in may .
the iranian state is no longer a shareholder in german steel manufacturer thyssen-krupp and germany 's deutsche bank ended its 40-year association with iran .
iran seeks to court german investment the economic sanctions applied against iran have sparked much criticism in the business community .
german companies are among those who feel that trade restrictions with the islamic republic are harmful not only to iran .
however , some companies continue to work with iran despite the sanctions and profit from the refusal of others to trade with tehran .
those companies which remain in business in iran do so quietly .
german engineering giant siemens continues to operate in the country but insists that its business in iran accounts for less one percent of its turnover .
europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen says it still plans to expand its assembly-line cooperation in the country but insists " there 's nothing big " in the pipeline , according to a company spokesman .
oil giant bp has vowed it will not be involved in iran and says any future engagement " will be in accordance with us sanctions . "
iran relies heavily on german companies and their know-how , because a large part of the iranian industry depends on parts supplied by germany .
such is the need for german expertise that iranian vice foreign secretary mehdi safari specifically asked for more german investment in a recent statement : " we could easily have an exchange of commodities with germany which could total more than 20 billion euros , " he said .
as way of incentive , the iranian government has loosened investment laws and has privatized state enterprises so that foreign investors can take part .
by focusing on selling its energy sector , iran hopes to attract foreign investment in its oil and gas enterprises .
while iran has the second largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world , the country , hobbled by a lack of refineries and creaking infrastructure , still has to import gasoline .
china , russia picking up the slack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has stepped in to provide the goods germany wo n't while german investment in iran dropped by around 15 percent in the last year , china 's investments in the country are booming .
germany 's trade volume with iran totals around 3.5 billion euros , in comparison to china 's reported 30 billion dollars - an increase of 60 percent as compared to the previous year .
though the lion 's share of china 's profitable business with iran comes from its strong exports of consumer goods , some say there 's one overriding factor underpinning china 's success in the country .
" china , just like the russians , do n't take any notice of sanctions , " said daniel bernbeck , the head of the german-iranian chamber of commerce in teheran .
russia has doubled its trade with iran - much to the annoyance of european enterprises .
" if some countries abide by the restrictions of trade under the un sanctions and others do n't , then the sanction policy causes nothing but an imbalance in trade , " lamented felix neugart of the german chamber of industry and commerce .
domestic and international pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has promised hardship for those dealing with iran it 's not just the trade embargo on iran imposed by the un security council that 's hurting european businesses in iran .
the direct and indirect fallout of sanctions applied by the european union and germany are equally responsible for the plunge in profits .
for example , german companies who continue to export to iran can expect to have difficulties getting credit .
exports are also subject to such stringent controls that it 's difficult to make deliveries on time .
german companies also suffer from the fact that the accounts of the biggest iranian banks have been frozen and that german banks have exited iran .
there is also the question of which market is more important : iran or the united states ?
pursuing or maintaining trade links with iran runs the risk of angering the us , which has taken the lead in pressurizing european firms to sever trade links with iran .
european companies that continue to trade with iran can expect a hard time in the united states .
sidestepping sanctions still , experts say trade with iran is n't entirely impossible and some european companies do find a way to dodge un sanctions .
" the money just flows via third countries and most of the transactions take place in hard cash , " said bernbeck who lives in teheran .
in such a secretive climate , the focus is on a discreet network of middlemen who literally accept suitcases with wads of money and smuggle it out of the country .
" they 're medieval methods of doing business , " said bernbeck , who said he withdrew money from his bank in germany to pay his yearly rent in cash to his landlady in teheran , usually in cash in a bar .
" if a plane crashes on its way to tehran from germany , then the loss of the luggage would be more expensive than the loss of the plane , " he said .
change in political approach would help trade business federations describe the current policy towards iran as " paranoia combined with hysteria . "
though german exports to iran rose slightly this year , experts say in the long-run there will be a major shift in iran 's trading partners as the country looks for other investors and business players .
" germany certainly stands to lose in such a situation , " said henner fuertig of the leibniz institute for global and regional studies .
at present , saudi arabia is a favorite trading partner of the iranians .
the gulf nation has offered russia wide-ranging arms deals if in return moscow deepens cooperation with iran .
the future for trade with iran is as unstable as the international relationship with tehran .
" one should not hold on to the hope that iran will come around through sanctions alone , " said johannes reissner of the german foundation for science and politics .
a serious debate with - and about - iran must be restarted without political brinkmanship , he added .
many other experts support reissner 's view that the removal of sanctions and a return to diplomatic discussion without threats would be more constructive .
bildunterschrift : face-to-face negotiations between the eu and iran failed and have yet to be restarted " it 's not like we did n't talk to iran , " said one diplomat close to the west 's negotiations who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity .
" but the carrot and stick approach did n't work .
now we 've worked on both levels , " he said , referring to offering iran a repreive from economic and financial sanctions in exchange for freezing its enrichment activites .
while the rhetoric increases , the hidden trade with iran still blossoms .
the industrial parts , which germany refuses to deliver , now come from england .
asia is also scrambling to catch up with the west by exporting industrial know-how .
us trade increases as washington pressures others and the us is n't far behind .
us exports to iran have hugely increased during the bush administration 's two terms , showing stronger growth than under any other us government .
us goods to the value of $ 150 million were shipped into iran in 2007 alone .
all of which rankles with european investors who feel the pressure not to deal with tehran emanating from washington .
meanwhile , german companies continue to bail out of iran .
even a german manufacturer of faucets for bathtubs has discontinued his long-standing relationship with an iranian customer - because of the fear that the us could find out that he trades with iran .

the latest was french oil group total which said in a statement it was withdrawing from the country .
british-dutch group shell publicly pulled out from a gas project in iran in may .
the iranian state is no longer a shareholder in german steel manufacturer thyssen-krupp and germany 's deutsche bank ended its 40-year association with iran .
iran seeks to court german investment the economic sanctions applied against iran have sparked much criticism in the business community .
german companies are among those who feel that trade restrictions with the islamic republic are harmful not only to iran .
however , some companies continue to work with iran despite the sanctions and profit from the refusal of others to trade with tehran .
those companies which remain in business in iran do so quietly .
german engineering giant siemens continues to operate in the country but insists that its business in iran accounts for less one percent of its turnover .
europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen says it still plans to expand its assembly-line cooperation in the country but insists " there 's nothing big " in the pipeline , according to a company spokesman .
oil giant bp has vowed it will not be involved in iran and says any future engagement " will be in accordance with us sanctions . "
iran relies heavily on german companies and their know-how , because a large part of the iranian industry depends on parts supplied by germany .
such is the need for german expertise that iranian vice foreign secretary mehdi safari specifically asked for more german investment in a recent statement : " we could easily have an exchange of commodities with germany which could total more than 20 billion euros , " he said .
as way of incentive , the iranian government has loosened investment laws and has privatized state enterprises so that foreign investors can take part .
by focusing on selling its energy sector , iran hopes to attract foreign investment in its oil and gas enterprises .
while iran has the second largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world , the country , hobbled by a lack of refineries and creaking infrastructure , still has to import gasoline .
china , russia picking up the slack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has stepped in to provide the goods germany wo n't while german investment in iran dropped by around 15 percent in the last year , china 's investments in the country are booming .
germany 's trade volume with iran totals around 3.5 billion euros , in comparison to china 's reported 30 billion dollars - an increase of 60 percent as compared to the previous year .
though the lion 's share of china 's profitable business with iran comes from its strong exports of consumer goods , some say there 's one overriding factor underpinning china 's success in the country .
" china , just like the russians , do n't take any notice of sanctions , " said daniel bernbeck , the head of the german-iranian chamber of commerce in teheran .
russia has doubled its trade with iran - much to the annoyance of european enterprises .
" if some countries abide by the restrictions of trade under the un sanctions and others do n't , then the sanction policy causes nothing but an imbalance in trade , " lamented felix neugart of the german chamber of industry and commerce .
domestic and international pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has promised hardship for those dealing with iran it 's not just the trade embargo on iran imposed by the un security council that 's hurting european businesses in iran .
the direct and indirect fallout of sanctions applied by the european union and germany are equally responsible for the plunge in profits .
for example , german companies who continue to export to iran can expect to have difficulties getting credit .
exports are also subject to such stringent controls that it 's difficult to make deliveries on time .
german companies also suffer from the fact that the accounts of the biggest iranian banks have been frozen and that german banks have exited iran .
there is also the question of which market is more important : iran or the united states ?
pursuing or maintaining trade links with iran runs the risk of angering the us , which has taken the lead in pressurizing european firms to sever trade links with iran .
european companies that continue to trade with iran can expect a hard time in the united states .
sidestepping sanctions still , experts say trade with iran is n't entirely impossible and some european companies do find a way to dodge un sanctions .
" the money just flows via third countries and most of the transactions take place in hard cash , " said bernbeck who lives in teheran .
in such a secretive climate , the focus is on a discreet network of middlemen who literally accept suitcases with wads of money and smuggle it out of the country .
" they 're medieval methods of doing business , " said bernbeck , who said he withdrew money from his bank in germany to pay his yearly rent in cash to his landlady in teheran , usually in cash in a bar .
" if a plane crashes on its way to tehran from germany , then the loss of the luggage would be more expensive than the loss of the plane , " he said .
change in political approach would help trade business federations describe the current policy towards iran as " paranoia combined with hysteria . "
though german exports to iran rose slightly this year , experts say in the long-run there will be a major shift in iran 's trading partners as the country looks for other investors and business players .
" germany certainly stands to lose in such a situation , " said henner fuertig of the leibniz institute for global and regional studies .
at present , saudi arabia is a favorite trading partner of the iranians .
the gulf nation has offered russia wide-ranging arms deals if in return moscow deepens cooperation with iran .
the future for trade with iran is as unstable as the international relationship with tehran .
" one should not hold on to the hope that iran will come around through sanctions alone , " said johannes reissner of the german foundation for science and politics .
a serious debate with - and about - iran must be restarted without political brinkmanship , he added .
many other experts support reissner 's view that the removal of sanctions and a return to diplomatic discussion without threats would be more constructive .
bildunterschrift : face-to-face negotiations between the eu and iran failed and have yet to be restarted " it 's not like we did n't talk to iran , " said one diplomat close to the west 's negotiations who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity .
" but the carrot and stick approach did n't work .
now we 've worked on both levels , " he said , referring to offering iran a repreive from economic and financial sanctions in exchange for freezing its enrichment activites .
while the rhetoric increases , the hidden trade with iran still blossoms .
the industrial parts , which germany refuses to deliver , now come from england .
asia is also scrambling to catch up with the west by exporting industrial know-how .
us trade increases as washington pressures others and the us is n't far behind .
us exports to iran have hugely increased during the bush administration 's two terms , showing stronger growth than under any other us government .
us goods to the value of $ 150 million were shipped into iran in 2007 alone .
all of which rankles with european investors who feel the pressure not to deal with tehran emanating from washington .
meanwhile , german companies continue to bail out of iran .
even a german manufacturer of faucets for bathtubs has discontinued his long-standing relationship with an iranian customer - because of the fear that the us could find out that he trades with iran .
this is absurd , criticizes daniel bernbeck .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 16.07.2008 european rights activists slam guantanamo bay conditions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the video of the guantanamo inmate begging for help has sparked outrage european human rights activists have expressed alarm about a graphic video released this week showing a young canadian inmate at guantanamo bay weeping and calling out for help . a grainy seven-and-a-half hour video released by the lawyers of the youngest detainee held at the us military prison in cuba shows omar khadr weeping and begging for help .
" you do n't care about me , " khadr tells his interrogators .
" nobody cares about me . "
indeed , when khadr complains that the interrogators have not helped his case and asks to be returned home to canada , he is told , " we ca n't do anything for you . "
the video , shot over the course of four days in february 2003 when khadr was 16 and grilled by officials from the canadian security intelligence service spy agency is the first real insight into the conditions at guantanamo bay which have been slammed by human rights activists .
" for me that video is just the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang kaleck , general secretary of the european center for constitutional and human rights . " i 'm not an emotional person , but it 's easy when you watch that footage to fill in the blanks about what you 're not seeing . "
the united states is holding about 265 prisoners at guantanamo bay . 21-year-old omar khadr , the only western national among them , is charged with killing a us medic in afghanistan in 2002 at the age of 15 .
" this tape shows the inhumanity of what goes on at guantanamo , " said ferdinand muggenthaler , americas expert at amnesty international germany .
" though the video itself does n't show torture outright , it gives us an image of what happens there - the methods that interrogators are using . "
canada in violation of un protocol ?
in one excerpt , these methods include interrogators showing little sympathy for khadr 's myriad medical concerns .
" you look like you 're doing well to me , " says the interrogator .
" i 'm not a doctor but i think you 're getting good medical care . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .
if germany was able to secure the release of their nationals , canada should be able to do the same . "
canadian prime minister stephen harper does n't seem to agree , however .
though a canadian federal judge said khadr 's treatment at guantanamo bay violated international laws on human rights , the prime minister 's office held firm tuesday in its decision not to ask for khadr 's repatriation . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the iranian state is no longer a shareholder in german steel manufacturer thyssen-krupp and germany 's deutsche bank ended its 40-year association with iran .
iran seeks to court german investment the economic sanctions applied against iran have sparked much criticism in the business community .
german companies are among those who feel that trade restrictions with the islamic republic are harmful not only to iran .
however , some companies continue to work with iran despite the sanctions and profit from the refusal of others to trade with tehran .
those companies which remain in business in iran do so quietly .
german engineering giant siemens continues to operate in the country but insists that its business in iran accounts for less one percent of its turnover .
europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen says it still plans to expand its assembly-line cooperation in the country but insists " there 's nothing big " in the pipeline , according to a company spokesman .
oil giant bp has vowed it will not be involved in iran and says any future engagement " will be in accordance with us sanctions . "
iran relies heavily on german companies and their know-how , because a large part of the iranian industry depends on parts supplied by germany .
such is the need for german expertise that iranian vice foreign secretary mehdi safari specifically asked for more german investment in a recent statement : " we could easily have an exchange of commodities with germany which could total more than 20 billion euros , " he said .
as way of incentive , the iranian government has loosened investment laws and has privatized state enterprises so that foreign investors can take part .
by focusing on selling its energy sector , iran hopes to attract foreign investment in its oil and gas enterprises .
while iran has the second largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world , the country , hobbled by a lack of refineries and creaking infrastructure , still has to import gasoline .
china , russia picking up the slack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has stepped in to provide the goods germany wo n't while german investment in iran dropped by around 15 percent in the last year , china 's investments in the country are booming .
germany 's trade volume with iran totals around 3.5 billion euros , in comparison to china 's reported 30 billion dollars - an increase of 60 percent as compared to the previous year .
though the lion 's share of china 's profitable business with iran comes from its strong exports of consumer goods , some say there 's one overriding factor underpinning china 's success in the country .
" china , just like the russians , do n't take any notice of sanctions , " said daniel bernbeck , the head of the german-iranian chamber of commerce in teheran .
russia has doubled its trade with iran - much to the annoyance of european enterprises .
" if some countries abide by the restrictions of trade under the un sanctions and others do n't , then the sanction policy causes nothing but an imbalance in trade , " lamented felix neugart of the german chamber of industry and commerce .
domestic and international pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has promised hardship for those dealing with iran it 's not just the trade embargo on iran imposed by the un security council that 's hurting european businesses in iran .
the direct and indirect fallout of sanctions applied by the european union and germany are equally responsible for the plunge in profits .
for example , german companies who continue to export to iran can expect to have difficulties getting credit .
exports are also subject to such stringent controls that it 's difficult to make deliveries on time .
german companies also suffer from the fact that the accounts of the biggest iranian banks have been frozen and that german banks have exited iran .
there is also the question of which market is more important : iran or the united states ?
pursuing or maintaining trade links with iran runs the risk of angering the us , which has taken the lead in pressurizing european firms to sever trade links with iran .
european companies that continue to trade with iran can expect a hard time in the united states .
sidestepping sanctions still , experts say trade with iran is n't entirely impossible and some european companies do find a way to dodge un sanctions .
" the money just flows via third countries and most of the transactions take place in hard cash , " said bernbeck who lives in teheran .
in such a secretive climate , the focus is on a discreet network of middlemen who literally accept suitcases with wads of money and smuggle it out of the country .
" they 're medieval methods of doing business , " said bernbeck , who said he withdrew money from his bank in germany to pay his yearly rent in cash to his landlady in teheran , usually in cash in a bar .
" if a plane crashes on its way to tehran from germany , then the loss of the luggage would be more expensive than the loss of the plane , " he said .
change in political approach would help trade business federations describe the current policy towards iran as " paranoia combined with hysteria . "
though german exports to iran rose slightly this year , experts say in the long-run there will be a major shift in iran 's trading partners as the country looks for other investors and business players .
" germany certainly stands to lose in such a situation , " said henner fuertig of the leibniz institute for global and regional studies .
at present , saudi arabia is a favorite trading partner of the iranians .
the gulf nation has offered russia wide-ranging arms deals if in return moscow deepens cooperation with iran .
the future for trade with iran is as unstable as the international relationship with tehran .
" one should not hold on to the hope that iran will come around through sanctions alone , " said johannes reissner of the german foundation for science and politics .
a serious debate with - and about - iran must be restarted without political brinkmanship , he added .
many other experts support reissner 's view that the removal of sanctions and a return to diplomatic discussion without threats would be more constructive .
bildunterschrift : face-to-face negotiations between the eu and iran failed and have yet to be restarted " it 's not like we did n't talk to iran , " said one diplomat close to the west 's negotiations who spoke to dw-world.de on condition of anonymity .
" but the carrot and stick approach did n't work .
now we 've worked on both levels , " he said , referring to offering iran a repreive from economic and financial sanctions in exchange for freezing its enrichment activites .
while the rhetoric increases , the hidden trade with iran still blossoms .
the industrial parts , which germany refuses to deliver , now come from england .
asia is also scrambling to catch up with the west by exporting industrial know-how .
us trade increases as washington pressures others and the us is n't far behind .
us exports to iran have hugely increased during the bush administration 's two terms , showing stronger growth than under any other us government .
us goods to the value of $ 150 million were shipped into iran in 2007 alone .
all of which rankles with european investors who feel the pressure not to deal with tehran emanating from washington .
meanwhile , german companies continue to bail out of iran .
even a german manufacturer of faucets for bathtubs has discontinued his long-standing relationship with an iranian customer - because of the fear that the us could find out that he trades with iran .
this is absurd , criticizes daniel bernbeck .

the court injunction , heard by the state court in kassel late on monday , forced the german national olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- to scratch poleska - who finished second in the qualifying trial - in favor of third-placed bernhardt , much to the chagrin of dosb president thomas bach .
bernhardt finished third in the 200 meters breaststroke at the german national championships in april , just failing to get a top two spot needed to make the team for beijing .
rather than graciously facing the fact that she had come up just short , bernhardt ruthlessly exposed a footnote law within the rules of the german championships to force the hand of the dosb .
rival poleska accused of breaking club rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poleska says she did n't race as a club member in the us the court in kessel heard that poleska - a born-and-bred german , a national champion and olympic bronze medalist from athens 2004 - had previously raced for the coral springs swimming club in florida and not a german club .
german swimming federation rules allow athletes to compete for foreign college or school swimming teams but not foreign clubs .
" i 've never seen anything like this before - an athlete trying to box her way onto the team because of a technicality , a mistake by a colleague , " bach told reporters .
poleska said she had done nothing wrong and was not a member of any club when she swam in the florida meets .
" i see my position as crystal clear from a legal point of view , " she said .
" i 'm not afraid at all that i 'll miss the olympics . "
germany 's olympic swimming coach orjan madsen was also sure that poleska and not bernhardt would be representing germany in beijing .
" ' the fact is that anne was nominated by the dosb and already has her olympic team clothes that she 'll be traveling to beijing in , " he said .
michael wolski , a lawyer and chairman of bernhardt 's club sg frankfurt which filed the legal challenge on her behalf , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung he had presented documents showing poleska took part in 10 club meets for coral springs .
" i can not imagine she did not know the rules , " wolski was quoted by the paper as saying .
" everyone knows those rules . "
this is not the first time that national german law has stood in the way of a fair outcome as viewed from a sporting perspective .
former gdr swimmer astrid strauss was banned for failing a doping test , but continued to race inside a reunified germany after her international ban because a judge decided it only fair .

if this were to happen , bernhardt could well expect to spend more time in court than in the pool as the board 's decision would surely be the subject of a legal claim by the displaced swimmer .
if bernhardt does fly to beijing , it 's unlikely that she will be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the squad , especially those on the swimming team who will know that the third-best , and not second best , swimmer made the team and after a dirty legal challenge that went against all unwritten rules of sportsmanship .
more drama could follow if she is allowed in the squad .
olympic rules state that each country can only field two 200 meter breaststroke competitors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 16.07.2008 european rights activists slam guantanamo bay conditions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the video of the guantanamo inmate begging for help has sparked outrage european human rights activists have expressed alarm about a graphic video released this week showing a young canadian inmate at guantanamo bay weeping and calling out for help . a grainy seven-and-a-half hour video released by the lawyers of the youngest detainee held at the us military prison in cuba shows omar khadr weeping and begging for help .
" you do n't care about me , " khadr tells his interrogators .
" nobody cares about me . "
indeed , when khadr complains that the interrogators have not helped his case and asks to be returned home to canada , he is told , " we ca n't do anything for you . "
the video , shot over the course of four days in february 2003 when khadr was 16 and grilled by officials from the canadian security intelligence service spy agency is the first real insight into the conditions at guantanamo bay which have been slammed by human rights activists .
" for me that video is just the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang kaleck , general secretary of the european center for constitutional and human rights . " i 'm not an emotional person , but it 's easy when you watch that footage to fill in the blanks about what you 're not seeing . "
the united states is holding about 265 prisoners at guantanamo bay . 21-year-old omar khadr , the only western national among them , is charged with killing a us medic in afghanistan in 2002 at the age of 15 .
" this tape shows the inhumanity of what goes on at guantanamo , " said ferdinand muggenthaler , americas expert at amnesty international germany .
" though the video itself does n't show torture outright , it gives us an image of what happens there - the methods that interrogators are using . "
canada in violation of un protocol ?
in one excerpt , these methods include interrogators showing little sympathy for khadr 's myriad medical concerns .
" you look like you 're doing well to me , " says the interrogator .
" i 'm not a doctor but i think you 're getting good medical care . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .
if germany was able to secure the release of their nationals , canada should be able to do the same . "
canadian prime minister stephen harper does n't seem to agree , however .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 16.07.2008 european rights activists slam guantanamo bay conditions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the video of the guantanamo inmate begging for help has sparked outrage european human rights activists have expressed alarm about a graphic video released this week showing a young canadian inmate at guantanamo bay weeping and calling out for help . a grainy seven-and-a-half hour video released by the lawyers of the youngest detainee held at the us military prison in cuba shows omar khadr weeping and begging for help .
" you do n't care about me , " khadr tells his interrogators .
" nobody cares about me . "
indeed , when khadr complains that the interrogators have not helped his case and asks to be returned home to canada , he is told , " we ca n't do anything for you . "
the video , shot over the course of four days in february 2003 when khadr was 16 and grilled by officials from the canadian security intelligence service spy agency is the first real insight into the conditions at guantanamo bay which have been slammed by human rights activists .
" for me that video is just the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang kaleck , general secretary of the european center for constitutional and human rights . " i 'm not an emotional person , but it 's easy when you watch that footage to fill in the blanks about what you 're not seeing . "
the united states is holding about 265 prisoners at guantanamo bay . 21-year-old omar khadr , the only western national among them , is charged with killing a us medic in afghanistan in 2002 at the age of 15 .
" this tape shows the inhumanity of what goes on at guantanamo , " said ferdinand muggenthaler , americas expert at amnesty international germany .
" though the video itself does n't show torture outright , it gives us an image of what happens there - the methods that interrogators are using . "
canada in violation of un protocol ?
in one excerpt , these methods include interrogators showing little sympathy for khadr 's myriad medical concerns .
" you look like you 're doing well to me , " says the interrogator .
" i 'm not a doctor but i think you 're getting good medical care . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's treatment of prisoners at guantanamo bay has come in for harsh criticism in another clip , khadr is left alone in the interrogation room for over 20 minutes , a time during which he repeatedly shouts " help me . "
it 's these experiences , combined with files released by the foreign intelligence division of canada 's foreign affairs department revealing that khadr was forcibly deprived of sleep by his us captors to soften him up for questioning by the canadian agents , that most bother muggenthaler .
" this shows that the canadians knew what was happening to khadr , " said muggenthaler .
" they knew that what was going on at guantanamo was in direct opposition to the un 's optional protocol to the convention on the rights of a child - a protocol that canada ratified . "
the un protocol , which the us has yet to agree to , states that the inclusion of children under the age of 18 in an armed conflict is a war crime .
it likewise requires that former child soldiers should be given the chance to rehabilitate .
" youths are under pressure both from adults and from their peer group so it does n't make sense to treat them as adults , " said muggenthaler .
peer pressure from an unlikely peer for khadr , that outside pressure came from an undeniably potent force .
the youngest son of an egyptian-palestinian couple , khadr spent little of his youth in canada .
at the age of two , he moved with his family from toronto to peshawar , pakistan .
several years later , the family moved into osama bin laden 's compound in afghanistan .
as a teenager , omar attended a military training camp where he learned marksmanship , bombmaking and combat tactics .
when us forces invaded afghanistan , khadr fought alongside his father against them .
it 's this fighting that landed the 15-year-old in us custody .
during a protracted firefight outside ab khail , a small hill town near the pakistan border , khadr launched a grenade at us soldiers , killing one and injuring another .
though khadr was seriously injured in the fighting that followed , us medics tended to his injuries and the boy was subsequently brought to bagram air force base and later forwarded to guantanamo bay .
the right to a fair trial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue khadr should not be subject to a military tribunal there , he awaits a military tribunal on allegations of murder , attempted murder , conspiracy and aiding the enemy .
those charges , considered by some to be in direct conflict to the geneva convention , do n't worry kaleck .
instead , kaleck is concerned for khadr 's right to a fair trial .
" it 's especially a problem because khadr was a child at the time of the crime .
some might argue that if khadr was old enough to fight , he is old enough to face the consequences of his actions .
but the people at guantanamo , they are n't afforded the rights to criminal law when they face a military trial , " he said .
muggenthaler agreed .
" even if khadr is n't innocent , canada needs to ask the us to release him to them .
he 's the last western national at the camp , and if he were returned to canada , he could be given a fair trial there .
if germany was able to secure the release of their nationals , canada should be able to do the same . "
canadian prime minister stephen harper does n't seem to agree , however .
though a canadian federal judge said khadr 's treatment at guantanamo bay violated international laws on human rights , the prime minister 's office held firm tuesday in its decision not to ask for khadr 's repatriation . courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will be selling 800,000 volkswagens per year in the us by 2018 , and this new site will play a key role , " winterkorn forecast .
vw had been searching for the location of an assembly line to protect it from a relentless rise of the euro that has affected profits in north america .
making cars in the eurozone and selling them for dollars has cost european automakers dearly .
" this , along with our growth strategy , is a pre-requisite for the economic success of the company in the dollar region , " winterkorn added .

gm has already cut its us workforce by more that 40,000 employees as it shuttered plants in the wake of losses which have topped $ 54 billion since 2005 .

the creators wanted to make an ironic statement about the tyrants but not everyone appreciates the joke . the game , called das fuehrer quartett , is based on a popular german children 's card game called quartett , but with a difference .
in the traditional game , the cards feature cars or flowers or even beer brands , which players try to collect from their opponents .
in this new version , the cards present pictures and information on notorious historical figures such as joseph stalin , francisco franco and adolf hitler . " we did n't really have a clear political idea in mind with the game , " said volker oppmann of onkel & onkel , the berlin-based publishing house behind the deck .
" but we did want to take away some of the power that these figures still have .
when you can laugh at them , you do n't fear them as much . " each card features one dictator , the country he ruled , his educational / vocational background and how long he was in power , among other factoids .
the cards stick to the historical record and also present information that might be less well known , oppmann , 33 , said . for example , the card featuring stalin explains that while in school he was repeatedly caught reading material that had been banned .
the card on romania 's nicolae ceausescu reveals that he had a soft spot for vlad the impaler , said to have been the inspiration for bram stoker 's " dracula . " lighter touch the cards have an ironic tone , and the authors use wordplay in some of the descriptive categories or have a lighter touch when presenting additional information about a figure .
for augusto pinochet , the card says he destroyed a democratic system with help from the us , but rebuilt another one later , only to be toppled by it .
" somehow stupid , " it says . " i think we succeeded in finding the right mix of seriousness and fun , " said oppmann . bildunterschrift : the public appears to appreciate the game 's ironic tone ; the decks have been selling fast .
of the first print run of 2,000 , oppmann said more than half are sold out and a second printing is planned . but not everyone thinks presenting war criminals as slightly risible figures is a positive thing . tasteless and inappropriate ? berlin senator ehrhart körting , 66 , called the deck tasteless .
historian arnulf baring said it played down the enormity of the crimes committed . " the further back the third reich recedes in history , the more bizarre the way it is dealt with becomes , " he told the bild newspaper . oppmann rejects the critique , pointing out that when the card game was released at this year 's leipzig book fair , employees from the bundeszentrale für politische bildung , a democratic political education organization , found the cards hilarious and ordered five decks right away . " if these people can laugh at it , i 'm not worried , " he said . in fact , the goal of das fuehrer quartett , unlike in traditional quartett , is not to gather as many cards and dictators as you can .
in this version , the winner is the first person to rid him or herself of all these despots . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the video tape , made public by order of a canadian court , showed mr khadr during four days of questioning by canadian intelligence agents .
six months earlier , when he was only 15 years old , he had been captured in a bombed-out compound in afghanistan , badly injured and near death .
mr khadr was charged with murdering a us soldier , allegedly throwing a grenade during a violent exchange with american commandos .
his trial before a us military tribunal is expected in october . "
it 's time for this travesty to stop and for omar khadr to come home to canada to face justice under canadian law " nathan whitley lawyer for omar khadr mr khadr 's canadian lawyers pointed to footage from mr khadr 's second day of questioning which showed him frightened and sobbing , pleading with the canadian security agents .
the lawyers said they hoped to gain public support to renew pressure on the conservative government of prime minister stephen harper to demand the return of the young canadian , now 21 .
" it is beyond comprehension that prime minister harper continues to tolerate the treatment of a canadian citizen in this manner , " said nathan whitley , one of mr khadr 's lawyers , who accuses the us military authorities of torturing a confession from the wounded teenager .
" it 's time for this travesty to stop and for omar khadr to come home to canada to face justice under canadian law . "
' judicial process ' but mr harper has always maintained he will not seek mr khadr 's return to canada , and that position appeared to be unchanged after the release of the video .
q & a : military tribunals glimpse inside guantanamo anne howland , a spokeswoman for the canadian foreign ministry , repeated a statement made by the prime minister last week , that the government believes mr khadr is in a legal process that must continue .
mr harper has said in the past that he has received assurances that mr khadr is being treated humanely , and maintained that the charges he faces are very serious .
the government regards mr khadr 's trial as a judicial process , not a political one .
canada is the only western country that has not demanded the return of its detainees from the controversial detention centre at guantanamo bay .
france and britain are among the countries that have succeeded in having their nationals released following diplomatic pressure on us authorities .
the fact that mr khadr was only 15 at the time of his arrest has led some here to refer to him as a " child soldier " , including bob rae , the foreign affairs critic for the opposition liberal party .
" he 's clearly not going to get a real trial .
he 's going to get a military tribunal , " said mr rae .
" i think that omar khadr has -lsb- to be -rsb- brought home and that whatever justice is to be faced , he should face it here . "
strong views while that view is more or less shared by all three of canada 's three federal opposition parties , and human rights groups such as amnesty international , public opinion is sharply divided with strong views on either side of the debate .
media websites have been inundated with responses .
" i see khadr crying and whining about his physical state , " says one of 600 e-mails received by canada 's public broadcaster , the cbc .
" let 's not forget he has been accused of killing an american soldier .
so truthfully , i do n't feel sorry for him . "
says another : " whatever his crime ... he was a child when he was sent to afghanistan to fight and at that young age could not have possibly understood the implications of what he was doing .
he has suffered enough . "
some members of the khadr family have gained a reputation in canadian media interviews as al-qaeda sympathisers .
the late family patriarch , ahmed said khadr , was an associate of al-qaeda leader osama bin laden and the family spent time living in some of his compounds .
several family members now reside in toronto .
they did not grant any broadcast interviews but did speak to the canadian press news agency .
omar khadr 's sister , zaynab khadr , said that she was not optimistic his situation would improve in the near future .
she noted that another brother , abdullah khadr , currently in prison in canada awaiting extradition to the us on charges of gun-running and conspiracy to murder americans abroad , was interrogated by canadian agents despite allegedly having been abused during his detention in pakistan .
" he was tortured for their benefit and he still continues to be in jail and it has n't changed much , so i ca n't expect it to be any different in guantanamo , " she said .
the video 's release follows intelligence reports made public last week showing that omar khadr was subjected to weeks of sleep deprivation by us military officials before being interviewed by canadian officials , and that the canadians were aware of the sleep deprivation .

but is the uk 's experience mirrored in other nations ?
bbc correspondents compare situations around the world .
danny wood , spain spain 's ministry for the interior does compile separate statistics for knife crimes , but not because crimes with knives are on the rise .
according to government statistics , 135 people died from knife injuries in 2007 and nearly 488,000 knives were confiscated by police .
those figures do not represent any significant change compared to previous years and guns remain the preferred lethal weapon .
any worries about knife crime in spain tend to be overshadowed by other crime concerns , like violent burglaries by gangs , including russian and eastern european groups .
they are known to target wealthy residential areas and often use firearms to threaten their victims .
knife related violence can feature among spanish and latin american street gangs who are seen by some as a growing urban problem .
some reports in the media suggest that violence involving knives - especially resulting from fights among teenagers and young men - has increased dramatically in recent years .
but in that context , there is not a wave of knife crime and it does not seem to overly preoccupy the authorities or the wider community .
chris hogg , tokyo in japan there is great concern about what is perceived to be a rising level of knife crime .
in june a man ran amok in a tokyo shopping district , killing seven people and injuring seven more , stabbing his victims with a double edged hunting knife .
sadly , such incidents are not as unusual here as they once were .
seven died when a knifeman ran amok in tokyo newspaper reports say the national police agency is now considering whether carrying a double-edged knife should be outlawed .
these knives are often depicted in japanese video games .
the fear is that the games make them popular with young people .
japanese law already prohibits people from carrying a knife with a blade 6cm -lrb- 2.4in -rrb- or longer unless they have a good reason to have it , although it 's not illegal to possess a knife that long .
reports suggest that in 2007 there were 40 % more knife crimes than there were five years earlier .
but the numbers were still pretty low compared to other countries - fewer than 5,000 violations of the knife crime law in a country of more than 127 million people .
jane lyons , new york new york city has a reputation for being an edgy , sometimes dangerous city .
but in fact it is one of the safest big cities in the united states .
over the past 10 years violent crime has fallen by 41 % .
murder rates in the city are currently at their lowest rate since 1963 .
like other dangerous weapons , carrying a knife in new york city is illegal , but knives are not perceived as being a specific problem on new york city streets .
efforts to stop violent crime here tend to focus more on guns , and the legislation to restrict their sale and possession .
the most recent tactic that the new york city police department -lrb- nypd -rrb- has used against violent and petty crime is called operation impact .
it focuses on targeting crime on a very local level , sending lots of police officers to very specific trouble spots such as housing estates or shopping malls .
julian isherwood , copenhagen in denmark there are strict rules as to the length of knives that can be carried in public and police have broad powers to search individuals without due cause .
at a maximum length of 7cm -lrb- 2.7 inches -rrb- , almost all sharp instruments that can be used to stab are forbidden in public places .
the rules do not apply to certain trades , such as fishermen or others who require knives as the tools of their profession .
however , tradesmen are advised to leave any sharp tools elsewhere when visiting pubs or public places , and are liable to be fined if knives , screwdrivers or other instruments can not be proved to be necessary at a location .
call for cctv copenhagen and other major cities have been designated as special search areas where police have the right to institute body searches at any time .
at the same time , justice minister lene espersen has suggested that police introduce more cctv to stop crime - particularly knife crime .
despite these measures , however , the level of crime in which knives are involved has remained the same - 2-3 % of all violent crime - according to figures from the crime prevention council .
an unfortunate development , according to police , is that when knives are available they are used more frequently and with more devastating effect .
latest figures show that 2,549 illegal knives were confiscated in 2007 , while 3,113 were confiscated in 2006 .
richard galpin , moscow knife crime has not been singled out so far by russian authorities or the population in moscow as being a particular problem .
instead , the ministry of interior provides country-wide statistics apparently showing that the number of crimes committed using a weapon of any kind dropped by almost a third in the first half of 2008 - taking the total to fewer than 5,000 incidents .
but this extremely low figure does not tally with what non-governmental organisations investigating specific types of crime are finding from their research .
take for example the latest figures from sova , a non-governmental organisation -lrb- ngo -rrb- which focuses on racist violence in russia .
racist murders it says the number of racist attacks is increasing by 15-20 % every year .

but is the uk 's experience mirrored in other nations ?
bbc correspondents compare situations around the world .
danny wood , spain spain 's ministry for the interior does compile separate statistics for knife crimes , but not because crimes with knives are on the rise .
according to government statistics , 135 people died from knife injuries in 2007 and nearly 488,000 knives were confiscated by police .
those figures do not represent any significant change compared to previous years and guns remain the preferred lethal weapon .
any worries about knife crime in spain tend to be overshadowed by other crime concerns , like violent burglaries by gangs , including russian and eastern european groups .
they are known to target wealthy residential areas and often use firearms to threaten their victims .
knife related violence can feature among spanish and latin american street gangs who are seen by some as a growing urban problem .
some reports in the media suggest that violence involving knives - especially resulting from fights among teenagers and young men - has increased dramatically in recent years .
but in that context , there is not a wave of knife crime and it does not seem to overly preoccupy the authorities or the wider community .
chris hogg , tokyo in japan there is great concern about what is perceived to be a rising level of knife crime .
in june a man ran amok in a tokyo shopping district , killing seven people and injuring seven more , stabbing his victims with a double edged hunting knife .
sadly , such incidents are not as unusual here as they once were .
seven died when a knifeman ran amok in tokyo newspaper reports say the national police agency is now considering whether carrying a double-edged knife should be outlawed .
these knives are often depicted in japanese video games .
the fear is that the games make them popular with young people .
japanese law already prohibits people from carrying a knife with a blade 6cm -lrb- 2.4in -rrb- or longer unless they have a good reason to have it , although it 's not illegal to possess a knife that long .
reports suggest that in 2007 there were 40 % more knife crimes than there were five years earlier .
but the numbers were still pretty low compared to other countries - fewer than 5,000 violations of the knife crime law in a country of more than 127 million people .
jane lyons , new york new york city has a reputation for being an edgy , sometimes dangerous city .
but in fact it is one of the safest big cities in the united states .
over the past 10 years violent crime has fallen by 41 % .
murder rates in the city are currently at their lowest rate since 1963 .
like other dangerous weapons , carrying a knife in new york city is illegal , but knives are not perceived as being a specific problem on new york city streets .
efforts to stop violent crime here tend to focus more on guns , and the legislation to restrict their sale and possession .
the most recent tactic that the new york city police department -lrb- nypd -rrb- has used against violent and petty crime is called operation impact .
it focuses on targeting crime on a very local level , sending lots of police officers to very specific trouble spots such as housing estates or shopping malls .
julian isherwood , copenhagen in denmark there are strict rules as to the length of knives that can be carried in public and police have broad powers to search individuals without due cause .
at a maximum length of 7cm -lrb- 2.7 inches -rrb- , almost all sharp instruments that can be used to stab are forbidden in public places .
the rules do not apply to certain trades , such as fishermen or others who require knives as the tools of their profession .
however , tradesmen are advised to leave any sharp tools elsewhere when visiting pubs or public places , and are liable to be fined if knives , screwdrivers or other instruments can not be proved to be necessary at a location .
call for cctv copenhagen and other major cities have been designated as special search areas where police have the right to institute body searches at any time .
at the same time , justice minister lene espersen has suggested that police introduce more cctv to stop crime - particularly knife crime .
despite these measures , however , the level of crime in which knives are involved has remained the same - 2-3 % of all violent crime - according to figures from the crime prevention council .
an unfortunate development , according to police , is that when knives are available they are used more frequently and with more devastating effect .
latest figures show that 2,549 illegal knives were confiscated in 2007 , while 3,113 were confiscated in 2006 .
richard galpin , moscow knife crime has not been singled out so far by russian authorities or the population in moscow as being a particular problem .
instead , the ministry of interior provides country-wide statistics apparently showing that the number of crimes committed using a weapon of any kind dropped by almost a third in the first half of 2008 - taking the total to fewer than 5,000 incidents .
but this extremely low figure does not tally with what non-governmental organisations investigating specific types of crime are finding from their research .
take for example the latest figures from sova , a non-governmental organisation -lrb- ngo -rrb- which focuses on racist violence in russia .
racist murders it says the number of racist attacks is increasing by 15-20 % every year .
from january to may this year , 59 people were murdered and more than 200 injured .
most of these racist murders were in moscow and most involved the use of knives .
the police themselves admit that knives are the weapons of choice for gangs of skinheads .

but is the uk 's experience mirrored in other nations ?
bbc correspondents compare situations around the world .
danny wood , spain spain 's ministry for the interior does compile separate statistics for knife crimes , but not because crimes with knives are on the rise .
according to government statistics , 135 people died from knife injuries in 2007 and nearly 488,000 knives were confiscated by police .
those figures do not represent any significant change compared to previous years and guns remain the preferred lethal weapon .
any worries about knife crime in spain tend to be overshadowed by other crime concerns , like violent burglaries by gangs , including russian and eastern european groups .
they are known to target wealthy residential areas and often use firearms to threaten their victims .
knife related violence can feature among spanish and latin american street gangs who are seen by some as a growing urban problem .
some reports in the media suggest that violence involving knives - especially resulting from fights among teenagers and young men - has increased dramatically in recent years .
but in that context , there is not a wave of knife crime and it does not seem to overly preoccupy the authorities or the wider community .
chris hogg , tokyo in japan there is great concern about what is perceived to be a rising level of knife crime .
in june a man ran amok in a tokyo shopping district , killing seven people and injuring seven more , stabbing his victims with a double edged hunting knife .
sadly , such incidents are not as unusual here as they once were .
seven died when a knifeman ran amok in tokyo newspaper reports say the national police agency is now considering whether carrying a double-edged knife should be outlawed .
these knives are often depicted in japanese video games .
the fear is that the games make them popular with young people .
japanese law already prohibits people from carrying a knife with a blade 6cm -lrb- 2.4in -rrb- or longer unless they have a good reason to have it , although it 's not illegal to possess a knife that long .
reports suggest that in 2007 there were 40 % more knife crimes than there were five years earlier .
but the numbers were still pretty low compared to other countries - fewer than 5,000 violations of the knife crime law in a country of more than 127 million people .
jane lyons , new york new york city has a reputation for being an edgy , sometimes dangerous city .
but in fact it is one of the safest big cities in the united states .
over the past 10 years violent crime has fallen by 41 % .
murder rates in the city are currently at their lowest rate since 1963 .
like other dangerous weapons , carrying a knife in new york city is illegal , but knives are not perceived as being a specific problem on new york city streets .
efforts to stop violent crime here tend to focus more on guns , and the legislation to restrict their sale and possession .
the most recent tactic that the new york city police department -lrb- nypd -rrb- has used against violent and petty crime is called operation impact .
it focuses on targeting crime on a very local level , sending lots of police officers to very specific trouble spots such as housing estates or shopping malls .
julian isherwood , copenhagen in denmark there are strict rules as to the length of knives that can be carried in public and police have broad powers to search individuals without due cause .
at a maximum length of 7cm -lrb- 2.7 inches -rrb- , almost all sharp instruments that can be used to stab are forbidden in public places .
the rules do not apply to certain trades , such as fishermen or others who require knives as the tools of their profession .
however , tradesmen are advised to leave any sharp tools elsewhere when visiting pubs or public places , and are liable to be fined if knives , screwdrivers or other instruments can not be proved to be necessary at a location .
call for cctv copenhagen and other major cities have been designated as special search areas where police have the right to institute body searches at any time .
at the same time , justice minister lene espersen has suggested that police introduce more cctv to stop crime - particularly knife crime .
despite these measures , however , the level of crime in which knives are involved has remained the same - 2-3 % of all violent crime - according to figures from the crime prevention council .
an unfortunate development , according to police , is that when knives are available they are used more frequently and with more devastating effect .
latest figures show that 2,549 illegal knives were confiscated in 2007 , while 3,113 were confiscated in 2006 .
richard galpin , moscow knife crime has not been singled out so far by russian authorities or the population in moscow as being a particular problem .
instead , the ministry of interior provides country-wide statistics apparently showing that the number of crimes committed using a weapon of any kind dropped by almost a third in the first half of 2008 - taking the total to fewer than 5,000 incidents .
but this extremely low figure does not tally with what non-governmental organisations investigating specific types of crime are finding from their research .
take for example the latest figures from sova , a non-governmental organisation -lrb- ngo -rrb- which focuses on racist violence in russia .
racist murders it says the number of racist attacks is increasing by 15-20 % every year .
from january to may this year , 59 people were murdered and more than 200 injured .
most of these racist murders were in moscow and most involved the use of knives .
the police themselves admit that knives are the weapons of choice for gangs of skinheads .
and yet in russia there is no clear legislation banning the carrying of knives on the streets .
hugh schofield , paris france has seen no equivalent of the wave of fatal stabbings in britain , and newspaper reports on the so-called " culture du poignard " -lrb- knife culture -rrb- reigning in london and other big cities are read with universal horror .
but experts warn there is no cause for complacency .
where britain has gone , france could all too easily follow .
according to alain bauer , france 's leading criminologist , the carrying of knives and other weapons by adolescents is widespread in many poor neighbourhoods .
and if the number of murders nationwide remains relatively low -lrb- on average around 1,000 a year , of which only about 35 by minors -rrb- , there has been a huge increase recently in acts of violence carried out by minors .
gang culture " one big difference here is that our gang culture is directed mainly against representatives of the state .
in britain , it is more internecine , " says mr bauer .
" in general , here in france we have n't reached the point where knife-carriers move to the actual deed .
but it 's probably only a question of time . "
according to mr bauer , western societies are all caught in a similar pattern of youth violence , which he says is linked to a collapse of confidence in authority .
" across the west , we have a set of moral references that date from the 18th century , 19th century laws , 20th century police - and 21st century violence , " he says .

but is the uk 's experience mirrored in other nations ?
bbc correspondents compare situations around the world .
danny wood , spain spain 's ministry for the interior does compile separate statistics for knife crimes , but not because crimes with knives are on the rise .
according to government statistics , 135 people died from knife injuries in 2007 and nearly 488,000 knives were confiscated by police .
those figures do not represent any significant change compared to previous years and guns remain the preferred lethal weapon .
any worries about knife crime in spain tend to be overshadowed by other crime concerns , like violent burglaries by gangs , including russian and eastern european groups .
they are known to target wealthy residential areas and often use firearms to threaten their victims .
knife related violence can feature among spanish and latin american street gangs who are seen by some as a growing urban problem .
some reports in the media suggest that violence involving knives - especially resulting from fights among teenagers and young men - has increased dramatically in recent years .
but in that context , there is not a wave of knife crime and it does not seem to overly preoccupy the authorities or the wider community .
chris hogg , tokyo in japan there is great concern about what is perceived to be a rising level of knife crime .
in june a man ran amok in a tokyo shopping district , killing seven people and injuring seven more , stabbing his victims with a double edged hunting knife .
sadly , such incidents are not as unusual here as they once were .
seven died when a knifeman ran amok in tokyo newspaper reports say the national police agency is now considering whether carrying a double-edged knife should be outlawed .
these knives are often depicted in japanese video games .
the fear is that the games make them popular with young people .
japanese law already prohibits people from carrying a knife with a blade 6cm -lrb- 2.4in -rrb- or longer unless they have a good reason to have it , although it 's not illegal to possess a knife that long .
reports suggest that in 2007 there were 40 % more knife crimes than there were five years earlier .
but the numbers were still pretty low compared to other countries - fewer than 5,000 violations of the knife crime law in a country of more than 127 million people .
jane lyons , new york new york city has a reputation for being an edgy , sometimes dangerous city .
but in fact it is one of the safest big cities in the united states .
over the past 10 years violent crime has fallen by 41 % .
murder rates in the city are currently at their lowest rate since 1963 .
like other dangerous weapons , carrying a knife in new york city is illegal , but knives are not perceived as being a specific problem on new york city streets .
efforts to stop violent crime here tend to focus more on guns , and the legislation to restrict their sale and possession .
the most recent tactic that the new york city police department -lrb- nypd -rrb- has used against violent and petty crime is called operation impact .
it focuses on targeting crime on a very local level , sending lots of police officers to very specific trouble spots such as housing estates or shopping malls .
julian isherwood , copenhagen in denmark there are strict rules as to the length of knives that can be carried in public and police have broad powers to search individuals without due cause .
at a maximum length of 7cm -lrb- 2.7 inches -rrb- , almost all sharp instruments that can be used to stab are forbidden in public places .
the rules do not apply to certain trades , such as fishermen or others who require knives as the tools of their profession .
however , tradesmen are advised to leave any sharp tools elsewhere when visiting pubs or public places , and are liable to be fined if knives , screwdrivers or other instruments can not be proved to be necessary at a location .
call for cctv copenhagen and other major cities have been designated as special search areas where police have the right to institute body searches at any time .
at the same time , justice minister lene espersen has suggested that police introduce more cctv to stop crime - particularly knife crime .
despite these measures , however , the level of crime in which knives are involved has remained the same - 2-3 % of all violent crime - according to figures from the crime prevention council .
an unfortunate development , according to police , is that when knives are available they are used more frequently and with more devastating effect .
latest figures show that 2,549 illegal knives were confiscated in 2007 , while 3,113 were confiscated in 2006 .
richard galpin , moscow knife crime has not been singled out so far by russian authorities or the population in moscow as being a particular problem .
instead , the ministry of interior provides country-wide statistics apparently showing that the number of crimes committed using a weapon of any kind dropped by almost a third in the first half of 2008 - taking the total to fewer than 5,000 incidents .
but this extremely low figure does not tally with what non-governmental organisations investigating specific types of crime are finding from their research .
take for example the latest figures from sova , a non-governmental organisation -lrb- ngo -rrb- which focuses on racist violence in russia .
racist murders it says the number of racist attacks is increasing by 15-20 % every year .
from january to may this year , 59 people were murdered and more than 200 injured .
most of these racist murders were in moscow and most involved the use of knives .
the police themselves admit that knives are the weapons of choice for gangs of skinheads .
and yet in russia there is no clear legislation banning the carrying of knives on the streets .
hugh schofield , paris france has seen no equivalent of the wave of fatal stabbings in britain , and newspaper reports on the so-called " culture du poignard " -lrb- knife culture -rrb- reigning in london and other big cities are read with universal horror .
but experts warn there is no cause for complacency .
where britain has gone , france could all too easily follow .
according to alain bauer , france 's leading criminologist , the carrying of knives and other weapons by adolescents is widespread in many poor neighbourhoods .
and if the number of murders nationwide remains relatively low -lrb- on average around 1,000 a year , of which only about 35 by minors -rrb- , there has been a huge increase recently in acts of violence carried out by minors .
gang culture " one big difference here is that our gang culture is directed mainly against representatives of the state .
in britain , it is more internecine , " says mr bauer .
" in general , here in france we have n't reached the point where knife-carriers move to the actual deed .
but it 's probably only a question of time . "
according to mr bauer , western societies are all caught in a similar pattern of youth violence , which he says is linked to a collapse of confidence in authority .
" across the west , we have a set of moral references that date from the 18th century , 19th century laws , 20th century police - and 21st century violence , " he says .

lee , 66 , was cleared of a more serious charge of breach of trust .
the court in seoul also fined lee 110bn won -lrb- $ 109m -rrb- .
prosecutors had sought a seven-year jail term and 350bn won -lrb- $ 347m -rrb- in fines .
the charges followed a three-month investigation into alleged corruption at south korea 's biggest conglomerate .
lee , one of south korea 's richest men , had headed samsung for two decades before his resignation from the chairmanship in april .
' sorry ' the suspension of his three-year sentence for five years means he does not face an immediate jail term .
judge min byung-hun told seoul central district court that lee 's crime was " not serious enough to send him to prison " .
speaking after the verdict , lee said he was " sorry for causing trouble to the people " .
the corruption case has been keenly followed in south korea , where samsung remains one of the country 's most powerful and respected organisations despite the charges against lee .
samsung is best-known for its electronics unit , but it is also one of the world 's largest shipbuilders .
with a global workforce of 254,000 , it enjoyed annual profits of more than $ 12.9bn -lrb- £ 6.45bn -rrb- in 2006 and accounts for nearly a fifth of all south korean exports .

services across all 22 welsh councils have been disrupted by the action with schools , leisure centres and libraries closed and refuse collections hit .
the strike has been called by unions unison and unite over a pay offer of 2.45 % .
the unions want 6 % .
the action began at midnight on wednesday and will end at midnight on friday morning .
councils said plans were in place to limit the impact .
it is thought that around 600 of the 1,800 schools in wales are shut because of the strike .
this is more than during the recent national union of teachers strike in april in which around 500 schools were closed and another 400 partially shut .
the industrial action has also affected graduation ceremonies for hundreds of swansea university students .
these have been moved from the city 's historic brangwyn hall to a marquee on the campus provoking an angry response from students .
local authorities are doing everything possible to ensure that disruption is kept to a minimum steve thomas , welsh local government association union members will gather for a protest rally at john frost square in newport at 1100 bst where they will hand out leaflets and peanuts to passers by to highlight their claim that council workers are low paid .
there will also be rallies outside county hall in ruthin , denbighshire and outside the library buildings in llandudno , conwy .
the welsh local government association -lrb- wlga -rrb- said it was inevitable some front line services would be affected by the strike with the most likely being refuse collection , schools and adult social care .
swansea university 's graduation ceremony was moved from the brangwyn hall to a marquee " but local authorities are doing everything possible to ensure that disruption is kept to a minimum , preparing contingency plans and appropriate staff cover where possible , " said steve thomas , wlga 's chief executive .
" this will ensure that vital services provided to the most vulnerable in our communities are maintained .
" we urge members of the public to contact their local authority for the latest update on services affected by this week 's industrial action . "
mr thomas added there was " little appetite " for the strike by the welsh local government workforce and claimed there had been reports of union resignations .
" all this has led to considerable uncertainty over staffing levels which might have made the potential impact of the strike seem greater than it is , " he said .
there is no need to ask the government for more , no need to put up council taxes and no need to cut jobs or services dave prentis , unison unions say the pay offer for workers in town halls , school canteens and refuse depots is a real terms pay cut because of the current rate of inflation .
they are pressing for a 6 % rise or an increase of 50p per hour , which ever is greater , arguing that local government can pay for this out of the efficiency savings town halls have made so far this year .
peter allenson from unite said its members were working on the breadline .
" the blame for this dispute and the disruption to essential services sits squarely on the shoulders of the local government employers , " he said .
" the public will ask why a pay cut is forced on some of the country 's lowest paid workers while their employers hoard multi-millions in savings . "
dave prentis , general secretary of unison , which has 60,000 members in wales , said the strike action had been the last resort .
" local government employers are sitting on £ 3bn worth of efficiency savings made by our members they could use to settle the strike now , " he said .
" there is no need to ask the government for more , no need to put up council taxes and no need to cut jobs or services . "
but mr thomas from wlga said the strike would have no impact in making additional money available and that 2.45 % was its " last and final offer " .

services across all 22 welsh councils have been disrupted by the action with schools , leisure centres and libraries closed and refuse collections hit .
the strike has been called by unions unison and unite over a pay offer of 2.45 % .
the unions want 6 % .
the action began at midnight on wednesday and will end at midnight on friday morning .
councils said plans were in place to limit the impact .
it is thought that around 600 of the 1,800 schools in wales are shut because of the strike .
this is more than during the recent national union of teachers strike in april in which around 500 schools were closed and another 400 partially shut .
the industrial action has also affected graduation ceremonies for hundreds of swansea university students .
these have been moved from the city 's historic brangwyn hall to a marquee on the campus provoking an angry response from students .
local authorities are doing everything possible to ensure that disruption is kept to a minimum steve thomas , welsh local government association union members will gather for a protest rally at john frost square in newport at 1100 bst where they will hand out leaflets and peanuts to passers by to highlight their claim that council workers are low paid .
there will also be rallies outside county hall in ruthin , denbighshire and outside the library buildings in llandudno , conwy .
the welsh local government association -lrb- wlga -rrb- said it was inevitable some front line services would be affected by the strike with the most likely being refuse collection , schools and adult social care .
swansea university 's graduation ceremony was moved from the brangwyn hall to a marquee " but local authorities are doing everything possible to ensure that disruption is kept to a minimum , preparing contingency plans and appropriate staff cover where possible , " said steve thomas , wlga 's chief executive .
" this will ensure that vital services provided to the most vulnerable in our communities are maintained .
" we urge members of the public to contact their local authority for the latest update on services affected by this week 's industrial action . "
mr thomas added there was " little appetite " for the strike by the welsh local government workforce and claimed there had been reports of union resignations .
" all this has led to considerable uncertainty over staffing levels which might have made the potential impact of the strike seem greater than it is , " he said .
there is no need to ask the government for more , no need to put up council taxes and no need to cut jobs or services dave prentis , unison unions say the pay offer for workers in town halls , school canteens and refuse depots is a real terms pay cut because of the current rate of inflation .
they are pressing for a 6 % rise or an increase of 50p per hour , which ever is greater , arguing that local government can pay for this out of the efficiency savings town halls have made so far this year .
peter allenson from unite said its members were working on the breadline .
" the blame for this dispute and the disruption to essential services sits squarely on the shoulders of the local government employers , " he said .
" the public will ask why a pay cut is forced on some of the country 's lowest paid workers while their employers hoard multi-millions in savings . "
dave prentis , general secretary of unison , which has 60,000 members in wales , said the strike action had been the last resort .
" local government employers are sitting on £ 3bn worth of efficiency savings made by our members they could use to settle the strike now , " he said .
" there is no need to ask the government for more , no need to put up council taxes and no need to cut jobs or services . "
but mr thomas from wlga said the strike would have no impact in making additional money available and that 2.45 % was its " last and final offer " .

a study , in the international journal of obesity , showed mice genetically prone to obesity getting fatter generation by generation .
" epigenetic " tags , which affect the function of our genes , may be responsible , they say .
however , the researchers countered this effect in the mice through diet .
there is now a lot of information that foetal environment - be it malnourished or over-nourished - has an permanent impact on the metabolism of that foetus as it tries to cope dr karen lillycrop southampton university our genes alone do not fully explain why we turn out the way we do - why some people will develop cancer or alzheimer 's disease , while others become obese .
researchers increasingly believe that the effect of conditions in the womb on the developing foetus can play an important role in setting our future health .
while nothing can change our genes themselves , there is evidence that the womb environment can change the way our genes work .
specifically , it may be able to produce chemical changes which control the level at which certain genes function .
this process is called " epigenetics " .
while there is strong evidence that a mother 's weight has an impact on the future weight of her children , the reasons for this are not fully understood .
the researchers at the baylor college of medicine in houston , texas , used a type of mouse which , if offered a normal diet , will tend to put on weight .
gene silencing while one population of mice was fed this normal diet , another was fed a diet fortified with vitamins and folic acid , designed to alter the epigenetic process by " silencing " genes .
the mice on the normal diet gained weight , as expected , and subsequent generations were progressively more obese .
but those on the supplemented diet did not gain weight through successive generations .
dr robert waterland , who led the project , said he believed that the womb environment could alter the function of genes controlling the development of the part of the brain controlling appetite .
he said : " why is everyone getting heavier and heavier ?
maternal obesity could be promoting obesity in the next generation . "
he said : " what we have shown is that in each generation , the maternal obesity of the previous generation influences the establishment of the body weight regulatory mechanism . "
dr karen lillycrop , from southampton university , said that the paper was " interesting " , but stopped short of proving that an epigenetic effect was responsible for the effects seen in the mice .
" there is now a lot of information that foetal environment - be it malnourished or over-nourished - has an permanent impact on the metabolism of that foetus as it tries to cope . "
she said that while folic acid supplementation in the lab mice had stopped mice increasing in weight , there would be possible risks in similar fortification in humans .

powys council had planned to plunge over a third of its lamps into darkness for a year , but it has voted to turn even more off to balance the books .
the council 's annual street lighting bill is about £ 500,000 , but it said that was set to rise by £ 175,000 .
the decision to turn off more lamps will avoid an overspend on energy costs of £ 43,000 .
however , what the council describes as " core areas " , such as locations covered by cctv , pedestrian crossings and trunk roads , will not be affected by the move .
in april , officials said soaring energy costs , coupled with a tight budget , had forced the council to adopt a " radical approach " to street lighting .

some councils in england , such as buckinghamshire , essex , hampshire and hertfordshire are already putting similar schemes on trial .

in april , the charity help the aged feared the move in powys could affect the elderly , and it called on the council to consult the public before a decision was made .
the council staged a consultation exercise with town and community councils .

powys council had planned to plunge over a third of its lamps into darkness for a year , but it has voted to turn even more off to balance the books .
the council 's annual street lighting bill is about £ 500,000 , but it said that was set to rise by £ 175,000 .
the decision to turn off more lamps will avoid an overspend on energy costs of £ 43,000 .

advertisement wonders of the lundy deep -lrb- footage : natural england -rrb- five years without fishing around lundy island off the coast of devon have brought a significant revival in sea life , scientists report .
lobsters are seven times more abundant within the protected zone than outside .
the eastern coast of lundy is the uk 's only " no-take " zone , where fishing is completely prohibited .
conservation groups say uk seas need more of them , but the government 's recent marine bill promises much vaguer " marine conservation zones " .
it is not clear what levels of protection these areas would have .
the site was n't only set up to protect lobsters - it 's to protect the whole environment chris davis , natural england the lundy zone was set up five years ago by natural england and the devon sea fisheries committee , which administers fishing along the county 's coasts , in partnership with local fishermen .
natural england scientists believe the zone should help devon 's lobster-potters by providing a refuge where young lobsters can grow to maturity , then migrate into areas where commercial fishing is permitted .
on the up " the main result we have seen is an increase in the number of large lobsters in the no-take zone compared to areas where fishing is on-going , " said miles hoskin , the marine biologist engaged by natural england to lead the research .
there are more lobsters caught inside the zone , and they are larger recent surveys have found that lobsters above the minimum landing size are between six and seven times as abundant within the zone as outside .
" in recent years we 've also found an increase in the number of small lobsters within the zone and adjacent to the zone , " dr hoskin told bbc news .
" in the next year or two they 're all going to be lobsters that fishermen can catch . "
the team surveys five sites - one in the no-take zone , two commercially fished sites around lundy , and two comparison sites further afield , one on the north coast of devon and one in south wales .
surveying consists of laying and then retrieving strings of commercial lobster pots , and counting and sexing the animals inside .
the approximate doubling in numbers of young lobsters has not been seen at the two distant sites , suggesting that it is a consequence of the no-take zone .
scientists are now putting tags on the lobsters they catch .
fishermen are being encouraged to report catches of tagged animals , in order to show how far they are migrating out of the no-take zones .
no expansion fishermen are generally cautious about no-take zones , which is one reason why the government plumped for the much more adaptable " marine conservation zone " concept in the draft marine bill .
" it 's difficult to to say whether it 's helped us - we did n't used to fish in there much anyway , except close to shore , but it was always good for lobsters , " said john barbeary , whose lobster and whelk boat works out of ilfracombe .
" when we were asked about it we were all for it ... -lrb- but -rrb- we could n't afford to have the zone made any bigger because it would completely ruin our business , and i think you 'd find that with a lot of fishermen around the country - it would make it totally uneconomic . "
but sarah clark from the devon sea fisheries committee said she believed the zone was good for the industry .
" having a larger brood stock especially of females within the no-take zone will obviously produce more juveniles , " she said .
" we 're tagging them to see if they 're moving out - if they are , they 'll be moving out of the no-take zone into the area that 's being fished , and and that can only help with the fishery , and help fishermen too . "
natural values natural england 's root reason for wanting the zone closed was not to help fishermen , but to return a tiny fraction - 0.002 % - of the uk 's seas to the state they were in before the era of modern fishing .
" the site was n't only set up to protect lobsters - it 's to protect the whole environment , " said chris davis , the agency 's senior specialist in marine policy .
a crayfish is a surprise catch - " the first in five years " " it 's about protecting the fish and the sponges and the coral that 's here as well , and it 's doing a good job , though it 's a bit difficult to say on some of the species because they do n't reach maturity for 30 or 40 years . "
a by-product of nature protection may be an increase in the tourist trade .
a full analysis has yet to be done , but anecdotally the numbers of divers visiting lundy has risen .
however , the views of fishermen are likely to be highly influential when it comes to deciding how many of the new marine conservation zones - which are several years away from being proposed - acquire full protection .
so will the views of the burgeoning renewables industry , given the potential of uk seas for generating electricity through tidal and wave technologies as well as offshore wind turbines .

the approximate doubling in numbers of young lobsters has not been seen at the two distant sites , suggesting that it is a consequence of the no-take zone .
scientists are now putting tags on the lobsters they catch .
fishermen are being encouraged to report catches of tagged animals , in order to show how far they are migrating out of the no-take zones .
no expansion fishermen are generally cautious about no-take zones , which is one reason why the government plumped for the much more adaptable " marine conservation zone " concept in the draft marine bill .
" it 's difficult to to say whether it 's helped us - we did n't used to fish in there much anyway , except close to shore , but it was always good for lobsters , " said john barbeary , whose lobster and whelk boat works out of ilfracombe .
" when we were asked about it we were all for it ... -lrb- but -rrb- we could n't afford to have the zone made any bigger because it would completely ruin our business , and i think you 'd find that with a lot of fishermen around the country - it would make it totally uneconomic . "
but sarah clark from the devon sea fisheries committee said she believed the zone was good for the industry .
" having a larger brood stock especially of females within the no-take zone will obviously produce more juveniles , " she said .
" we 're tagging them to see if they 're moving out - if they are , they 'll be moving out of the no-take zone into the area that 's being fished , and and that can only help with the fishery , and help fishermen too . "
natural values natural england 's root reason for wanting the zone closed was not to help fishermen , but to return a tiny fraction - 0.002 % - of the uk 's seas to the state they were in before the era of modern fishing .
" the site was n't only set up to protect lobsters - it 's to protect the whole environment , " said chris davis , the agency 's senior specialist in marine policy .
a crayfish is a surprise catch - " the first in five years " " it 's about protecting the fish and the sponges and the coral that 's here as well , and it 's doing a good job , though it 's a bit difficult to say on some of the species because they do n't reach maturity for 30 or 40 years . "
a by-product of nature protection may be an increase in the tourist trade .
a full analysis has yet to be done , but anecdotally the numbers of divers visiting lundy has risen .
however , the views of fishermen are likely to be highly influential when it comes to deciding how many of the new marine conservation zones - which are several years away from being proposed - acquire full protection .
so will the views of the burgeoning renewables industry , given the potential of uk seas for generating electricity through tidal and wave technologies as well as offshore wind turbines .
