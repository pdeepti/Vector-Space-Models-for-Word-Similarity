more than 1.2 million flocked to a roughly one-mile long main road which had been closed to allow the scantily dressed mostly young people to shake to techno music blasted from 37 floats .
some 250 djs are taking part in the event , which is expected to last until midnight saturday .
driven by electronic dance music , the spectacle has gained a reputation over the past two decades for loudness , outlandish garb , marathon dancing , and , by some accounts , widespread use of the drug ecstasy .
organizers said 15 of the bands came from abroad , including from australia , south korea , ukraine and turkey .
each band occupied a float .
the amplifiers required cooling to stop them overheating .

michel , 21 , from the south-east of germany , was just as gushing as he described how he and his girlfriend had arrived in dortmund on the eve of the parade with nowhere to stay and had danced much of the night in a club .
" we made new friends who let us sleep -lrb- with 10 others -rrb- in a two-bed room at a bed-and-breakfast hotel .
real nice people , " he said .
highway to love the parade was being held in the west of germany for a second year after leaving berlin , where the annual spectacle began in 1989 .
organizers predicted a turnout of 1.2 million at the event on a section of national highway which was closed to traffic by city authorities and gave this year 's parade its motto , " highway to love . "
dj westbam , first up of 250 disc jockeys mixing the music , opened the event with his new highway to love " hymn . "
promoters said the parade could be seen live by satellite broadcast in 53 nations of the world .
the event was to continue all night in city clubs and other dance venues in dortmund , a big industrial city in germany 's ruhrgebiet metropolitan sprawl . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

whereas once life expectancy hovered around 35 , now that number ’ s closer to 80 .
but will we all live to 100 ? it 's friday afternoon in the small town of bad lippspringe and 92-year-old anneliese bee is paying a visit to her daughter , granddaughter and great-granddaughter .
four generations in one room is uncommon , bee knows .
“ as old as i am - and still able to get around - that 's a rarity , ” said bee , who lives in her own apartment and regularly cooks lunch for her family .
“ my mother died at 68 , my father-in-law at 70 and my mother-in-law at 68 , ” said bee .
but as bee has grown older , the life expectancy of those living in industrialized lands has also increased .
it 's not as unusual as it once was to see people living to 80 or 90 .
“ over the last several years , we 've seen the average life expectancy continuously increase , ” said bettina sommer of the federal statistics office in wiesbaden .
“ if we go back to 130 years ago , we see the average life expectancy of a newborn has nearly doubled . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centenarian rosa richter received government congratulations on her 100th sommer , who heads a working group dealing specifically with life expectancy averages , says that a female born in germany today can anticipate seeing the ripe old age of 82 .
male newborns can expect to reach 76 on average .
the questionable value of statistics of course , these values are purely hypothetical - a palm reading of what 's possible in the future , if you will .
it remains impossible to predict on an individual basis just how long a person might live .
“ naturally , not all people who lived 130 years ago died at the age of 38 , ” said sommer .
“ many people died young , but there 's a good chance that others lived to be more than 60 or 70 years old . ”
the statistics likewise need to be adjusted according to infant mortality rates .
a high early death rate can decrease life expectancy tremendously .
one statistical possibility considers the notion that while two of four people live to be 80 years old , the other two die at birth .
that model makes for an average age of 40 .
at the same time , if we consider a group of four people in which only one person dies at birth and the other three reach the age of 80 , the life expectancy has suddenly jumped to 60 .
some countries moving in the opposite direction sinking infant mortality rates , then , have a lot to do with increasing life expectancy .
and in many countries , those rates have gone down thanks to medical advancements .
threats to infants and young children have substantially decreased due to the development of vaccines and antibiotics .
“ that 's definitely contributed to the sharp increase in life expectancy , ” said sommer .
“ and over the last century , the lifespan of older people has also increased . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children born in southern africa have greater problems aging at least that 's true for germany , which ranks among the countries with the longest average life .
unfortunately , that life increase has n't reached everywhere in the world , said sommer .
“ while these advancements over the last century have been felt across the world , there are likewise countries which are moving in the opposite direction . ”
in lands where aids is rampant , where many young people lose their lives in that battle , the life expectancy is sinking .
in southern african nations , the average lifespan is under 40 years .
the trend troubles many and aid agencies are working hard against the aids epidemic while also struggling to bring down infant mortality rates .
your chances of growing older increase with age while it may sound like common sense , the common belief now is that for every year you 've lived through , you 've increased your life expectancy .
the older a person grows , the better his or her chances are to become even older .
a 20-year-old can expect a higher lifespan than a newborn child because the 20-year-old has lived through the dangers of childhood and adolescence .
“ whoever is 80 today has a good chance of turning 81 tomorrow .
but a newborn first has to reach the age of 80 , ” said sommer .
that 's proven no problem for the spry and spirited 92-year-old anneliese bee .

“ many people died young , but there 's a good chance that others lived to be more than 60 or 70 years old . ”
the statistics likewise need to be adjusted according to infant mortality rates .
a high early death rate can decrease life expectancy tremendously .
one statistical possibility considers the notion that while two of four people live to be 80 years old , the other two die at birth .

your chances of growing older increase with age while it may sound like common sense , the common belief now is that for every year you 've lived through , you 've increased your life expectancy .
the older a person grows , the better his or her chances are to become even older .

" the eu has exhausted its room for maneuver in agriculture and can not go any further .
so we will not be making any further concessions , " said anne-marie idrac , a french government minister in charge of foreign trade .
idrac was speaking on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of eu ministers , convened in brussels to prepare the groundwork for next week 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks where 30 nations will try to salvage a set of long-floundering trade liberalization negotiations .
those talks will address the so-called doha round , which seek to bring down global trade barriers .
the negotiations have been dragging on since the round was launched in the qatar capital in november 2001 , amid disputes over subsidies to farmers by the us and eu and tariffs on industrial goods imposed by the developing economies of asia and latin america .
the 27-member eu runs the risk of being divided , with its southern members focused primarily on the agricultural sector and its northern members more interested in the services and industrial sectors .
but idrac insisted on friday that ministers had agreed to be united in strength .
the minister also reaffirmed the member states ' backing for the eu 's chief negotiator , trade commissioner peter mandelson , in spite of the fact that her president , nicolas sarkozy , had openly criticized his anti-protectionist stance only a month ago .
eu trade chief warns of failure mandelson on thursday said that a failure to reach a deal in geneva would hamper economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says failure could hamper economic growth the commissioner also said the eu was willing to accept a compromise deal drafted by wto head pascal lamy on the gradual reduction of eu import tariffs on bananas from latin america .
the eu currently offers more favorable conditions to banana exporters from its former colonies in africa , the pacific and the caribbean -lrb- apc -rrb- .
idrac said the eu would have to " strike a balance " between the requests of latin american producers , the need to encourage economic growth in the poorer apc countries , and the interests of the eu 's own banana producers .
the minister also called for an effective " anti-concentration " clause to be included in the rounds .
the clause , which is designed to prevent developing countries from defending entire sectors of their economy , has been strongly criticized by india .
one german government minister said next week 's talks had a " 50 to 50 chance " of succeeding .
" there are still plenty of obstacles and risks , " said bernd pfaffenbach , a junior minister who acts as germany 's sherpa at group of eight meetings .
pfaffenbach said the eu was not prepared to obtain a deal " at any price . "

" i think they have gone way too far on agriculture , " irish trade minister john mcguinness told journalists .
" we are keenly interested in a deal ... however that deal has to be balanced . "
he also refused to rule out the possibility of ireland vetoing any trade deal that did not suit dublin , describing it as an " option . "

" the eu has exhausted its room for maneuver in agriculture and can not go any further .
so we will not be making any further concessions , " said anne-marie idrac , a french government minister in charge of foreign trade .
idrac was speaking on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of eu ministers , convened in brussels to prepare the groundwork for next week 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks where 30 nations will try to salvage a set of long-floundering trade liberalization negotiations .
those talks will address the so-called doha round , which seek to bring down global trade barriers .
the negotiations have been dragging on since the round was launched in the qatar capital in november 2001 , amid disputes over subsidies to farmers by the us and eu and tariffs on industrial goods imposed by the developing economies of asia and latin america .
the 27-member eu runs the risk of being divided , with its southern members focused primarily on the agricultural sector and its northern members more interested in the services and industrial sectors .
but idrac insisted on friday that ministers had agreed to be united in strength .
the minister also reaffirmed the member states ' backing for the eu 's chief negotiator , trade commissioner peter mandelson , in spite of the fact that her president , nicolas sarkozy , had openly criticized his anti-protectionist stance only a month ago .
eu trade chief warns of failure mandelson on thursday said that a failure to reach a deal in geneva would hamper economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says failure could hamper economic growth the commissioner also said the eu was willing to accept a compromise deal drafted by wto head pascal lamy on the gradual reduction of eu import tariffs on bananas from latin america .
the eu currently offers more favorable conditions to banana exporters from its former colonies in africa , the pacific and the caribbean -lrb- apc -rrb- .
idrac said the eu would have to " strike a balance " between the requests of latin american producers , the need to encourage economic growth in the poorer apc countries , and the interests of the eu 's own banana producers .
the minister also called for an effective " anti-concentration " clause to be included in the rounds .
the clause , which is designed to prevent developing countries from defending entire sectors of their economy , has been strongly criticized by india .
one german government minister said next week 's talks had a " 50 to 50 chance " of succeeding .
" there are still plenty of obstacles and risks , " said bernd pfaffenbach , a junior minister who acts as germany 's sherpa at group of eight meetings .
pfaffenbach said the eu was not prepared to obtain a deal " at any price . "

the negotiations have been dragging on since the round was launched in the qatar capital in november 2001 , amid disputes over subsidies to farmers by the us and eu and tariffs on industrial goods imposed by the developing economies of asia and latin america .
the 27-member eu runs the risk of being divided , with its southern members focused primarily on the agricultural sector and its northern members more interested in the services and industrial sectors .
but idrac insisted on friday that ministers had agreed to be united in strength .
the minister also reaffirmed the member states ' backing for the eu 's chief negotiator , trade commissioner peter mandelson , in spite of the fact that her president , nicolas sarkozy , had openly criticized his anti-protectionist stance only a month ago .
eu trade chief warns of failure mandelson on thursday said that a failure to reach a deal in geneva would hamper economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says failure could hamper economic growth the commissioner also said the eu was willing to accept a compromise deal drafted by wto head pascal lamy on the gradual reduction of eu import tariffs on bananas from latin america .
the eu currently offers more favorable conditions to banana exporters from its former colonies in africa , the pacific and the caribbean -lrb- apc -rrb- .
idrac said the eu would have to " strike a balance " between the requests of latin american producers , the need to encourage economic growth in the poorer apc countries , and the interests of the eu 's own banana producers .
the minister also called for an effective " anti-concentration " clause to be included in the rounds .
the clause , which is designed to prevent developing countries from defending entire sectors of their economy , has been strongly criticized by india .
one german government minister said next week 's talks had a " 50 to 50 chance " of succeeding .
" there are still plenty of obstacles and risks , " said bernd pfaffenbach , a junior minister who acts as germany 's sherpa at group of eight meetings .
pfaffenbach said the eu was not prepared to obtain a deal " at any price . "
ireland threatens veto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has been restrained on trade since taking on the presidency while france avoided controversy on agriculture , ireland - paris ' long-time ally on agriculture - accused the european commission of offering too much as europe 's negotiator within the wto while getting little in return .
" i think they have gone way too far on agriculture , " irish trade minister john mcguinness told journalists .
" we are keenly interested in a deal ... however that deal has to be balanced . "
he also refused to rule out the possibility of ireland vetoing any trade deal that did not suit dublin , describing it as an " option . "
accounting for 20 percent of global trade , the eu is a heavy hitter in the wto , where it has long been under pressure from emerging agriculture powers and the united states to ease its farm support . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presence of a senior us diplomat at the talks has promoted an atmopshere of cautious optimism . on behalf of the veto powers and germany , eu chief diplomat javier solana will meet iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili to talk about an offer of future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics once tehran halts its nuclear activities . the united states ' representative at the talks , undersecretary of state william burns , is the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
he will not take an active role in the talks , however . representatives from britain , france , germany , russia and chinawill also attend the meeting .
these and other countries are concerned iran could one day use its civilian nuclear program to build atom bombs , an allegation which tehran strongly denies . western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment .
iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out . rice admits to us policy shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns will make history but will not take an active role the sending of burns as a senior envoy to geneva to participate in the nuclear talks with iran 's top negotiator shows that the united states has shifted position on diplomacy with iran , secretary of state condoleezza rice said on friday . but she insisted that tehran must suspend its enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear materials for substantive talks with washington . " the united states does n't have any permanent enemies , " rice said in response to a reporter 's question on the unexpected move to send a diplomat to meet directly with jalili in geneva . " and we hope this signal we 're sending , that we fully support the track that iran could take for a better relationship with the international community , is one the united states stands fully behind . " " we have been very clear that any country can change course , " rice added .
" this decision to send undersecretary -lrb- william -rrb- burns is an affirmation of the policy that we have been pursuing with our european allies ... for some time now . " rice called the move " a strong signal to the entire world that we have been very serious about this diplomacy and we will remain very serious about this diplomacy . " rice pointed out that she had endorsed the proposal from the so-called p5 plus one - the united states , france , britain , china , russia and germany - on incentives to advance talks with iran on halting its nuclear program . conditions remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said that the us still has conditions for negotiations she called sending burns to geneva to meet with jalili and eu foreign policy chief javier solana the " book end " to that process . " but it should be very clear to everyone the united states has a condition for the beginning of negotiations with iran , and that condition remains the verifiable suspension of iran 's enrichment and reprocessing activities , " rice said . asked in an interview with cnn , excerpts of which were aired friday , whether sending burns to geneva was a major policy change , rice answered : " i acknowledge that what we 've done is to make a step that we think demonstrates to everyone our seriousness about this process . " but what has not changed is that the united states is determined to have negotiations only when iran has suspended its enrichment and reprocessing .
that 's when the united states can join . " asked if saturday 's meeting is a one-shot deal , rice replied , " this is . " one-shot deal " we have one chance to receive the iranian response .
i transmitted the proposal .
-lrb- burns -rrb- will receive the response , " she told cnn .
" he will listen , and if iran is ready to suspend , then the united states will be there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jalili was optimistic that the discussions would be positive in tehran , jalili on friday expressed optimism that weekend talks would be constructive , provided washington came with the right approach . " what is important for us is with what approach they come to the talks .
if it is with a constructive approach , and that they refrain from past mistakes , then for sure we will have constructive talks , " he was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency before leaving tehran for geneva . washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends uranium enrichment and insisted on wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate . nonetheless , it will be the first time that the united states , which severed relations with iran in 1980 after the islamic revolution , will be present in the negotiations aimed at persuading tehran to freeze uranium enrichment . russian , iranian presidents hopeful meanwhile , the presidents of iran and russia expressed hope for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis on the eve of the key talks . president mahmoud ahmadinejad and his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev held their first telephone talks late on friday , iranian state media and the kremlin said . " in the geneva negotiations ... we can examine ways to make decisions in different fields and help resolve the existing issues , " the website of iranian state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying . he also expressed satisfaction over the current state of ties between tehran and moscow , which has substantial economic interests in the islamic republic , state television said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev watches the middle east situation with interest the kremlin , meanwhile , quoted medvedev as urging iran " to cooperate fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to clarify questions remaining about the iranian nuclear program .

the presence of a senior us diplomat at the talks has promoted an atmopshere of cautious optimism . on behalf of the veto powers and germany , eu chief diplomat javier solana will meet iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili to talk about an offer of future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics once tehran halts its nuclear activities . the united states ' representative at the talks , undersecretary of state william burns , is the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
he will not take an active role in the talks , however . representatives from britain , france , germany , russia and chinawill also attend the meeting .
these and other countries are concerned iran could one day use its civilian nuclear program to build atom bombs , an allegation which tehran strongly denies . western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment .
iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out . rice admits to us policy shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns will make history but will not take an active role the sending of burns as a senior envoy to geneva to participate in the nuclear talks with iran 's top negotiator shows that the united states has shifted position on diplomacy with iran , secretary of state condoleezza rice said on friday . but she insisted that tehran must suspend its enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear materials for substantive talks with washington . " the united states does n't have any permanent enemies , " rice said in response to a reporter 's question on the unexpected move to send a diplomat to meet directly with jalili in geneva . " and we hope this signal we 're sending , that we fully support the track that iran could take for a better relationship with the international community , is one the united states stands fully behind . " " we have been very clear that any country can change course , " rice added .
" this decision to send undersecretary -lrb- william -rrb- burns is an affirmation of the policy that we have been pursuing with our european allies ... for some time now . " rice called the move " a strong signal to the entire world that we have been very serious about this diplomacy and we will remain very serious about this diplomacy . " rice pointed out that she had endorsed the proposal from the so-called p5 plus one - the united states , france , britain , china , russia and germany - on incentives to advance talks with iran on halting its nuclear program . conditions remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said that the us still has conditions for negotiations she called sending burns to geneva to meet with jalili and eu foreign policy chief javier solana the " book end " to that process . " but it should be very clear to everyone the united states has a condition for the beginning of negotiations with iran , and that condition remains the verifiable suspension of iran 's enrichment and reprocessing activities , " rice said . asked in an interview with cnn , excerpts of which were aired friday , whether sending burns to geneva was a major policy change , rice answered : " i acknowledge that what we 've done is to make a step that we think demonstrates to everyone our seriousness about this process . " but what has not changed is that the united states is determined to have negotiations only when iran has suspended its enrichment and reprocessing .
that 's when the united states can join . " asked if saturday 's meeting is a one-shot deal , rice replied , " this is . " one-shot deal " we have one chance to receive the iranian response .
i transmitted the proposal .
-lrb- burns -rrb- will receive the response , " she told cnn .
" he will listen , and if iran is ready to suspend , then the united states will be there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jalili was optimistic that the discussions would be positive in tehran , jalili on friday expressed optimism that weekend talks would be constructive , provided washington came with the right approach . " what is important for us is with what approach they come to the talks .
if it is with a constructive approach , and that they refrain from past mistakes , then for sure we will have constructive talks , " he was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency before leaving tehran for geneva . washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends uranium enrichment and insisted on wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate . nonetheless , it will be the first time that the united states , which severed relations with iran in 1980 after the islamic revolution , will be present in the negotiations aimed at persuading tehran to freeze uranium enrichment . russian , iranian presidents hopeful meanwhile , the presidents of iran and russia expressed hope for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis on the eve of the key talks . president mahmoud ahmadinejad and his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev held their first telephone talks late on friday , iranian state media and the kremlin said . " in the geneva negotiations ... we can examine ways to make decisions in different fields and help resolve the existing issues , " the website of iranian state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying . he also expressed satisfaction over the current state of ties between tehran and moscow , which has substantial economic interests in the islamic republic , state television said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev watches the middle east situation with interest the kremlin , meanwhile , quoted medvedev as urging iran " to cooperate fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to clarify questions remaining about the iranian nuclear program .

the rule applies to all under-23 players - unless they do n't want to play at the games .
the olympic tournament is an under-23 event with three older players allowed per team .
" the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " ioc president jacques rogge told dpa news agency during an interview in lausanne , switzerland .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .

soccer clubs have received a stern warning from the ruling body fifa and the international olympic committee that they must release players for the beijing games . fifa and the ioc said that clubs who refuse to let players go to the august 8-24 olympics will have these players suspended from club matches for the period .
the rule applies to all under-23 players - unless they do n't want to play at the games .
the olympic tournament is an under-23 event with three older players allowed per team .
" the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " ioc president jacques rogge told dpa news agency during an interview in lausanne , switzerland .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .
they sent a letter a couple of days ago to remind them of that . "
fifa spokesman alain leiblang confirmed the letter to dpa news agency on friday , saying : " we have informed the clubs that they must release the under-23 players . "
german clubs keeping players at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's rafinha is one of the bundesliga stars staying put while brazil 's ronaldinho and lionel messi of argentina are among the stars to play in beijing , others like brazil 's diego and rafinha , or belgium 's vincent kompany are not to be released by their german clubs , werder bremen , schalke and sv hamburg , respectively .
and ac milan vice-president alberto galliano said that his club would have not let newly-hired ronaldinho go to beijing had he been at milan before the player 's transfer from barcelona this week .
" we respect the obligation that he took on before he came to milan .
if he had already been a rossonero , we would not have let him go , but as he is joining us later we will let him go to the olympics , " said galliano .
milan coach carlo ancelotti even saw the bright side of it , saying : " it is a chance for him to find his fitness .
when he comes back he will be ready .
he will only need to learn his place in our system . "
bremen stand firm on diego diego , by contrast , is not to be a fellow-midfielder for brazil as many clubs disagree with the views of fifa and the ioc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego is said to be very angry about his club 's decision " there is no such rule according to the statutes .
we have no written statement from fifa or the ioc that we have to release someone , " said bremen sports director klaus allofs .
the clubs argue that the olympic tournament is not on the official fifa calendar -lrb- unlike the women 's event -rrb- and that it is therefore up to them to decide whether their men can play for gold or not .
rogge said he can understand the clubs but at the same time wants the football tournament to be as attractive as possible .
" their clubs have other motives , the regular calendar , champions league qualifying and then they do n't want to send them .
they are afraid they could be injured , " rogge said .
" i am very happy that the big players want to participate in the games , ronaldinho wants to go to the games .
so there are a lot of great players who want to go .
the games are something special for them . "
rogge said he would prefer no age restrictions to have all top stars compete but that he respects the under-23 agreement signed between ifa and the ioc in 1993 .
" we are happy to have soccer for various reasons .
it is the most popular sport in the world , it is a success in the olympic games , they are number three in audience among the 28 sports and they are number one in the sale of tickets , " said rogge . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with dpa news agency in wolfsburg , he deflated predictions that millions of people would be driving electric cars by the middle of the 2010s as " very optimistic . "
leohold said volkswagen would sell electric models , but cautioned , " it will take 20 to 25 years before electric cars achieve a market share of more than 10 per cent . "
volkswagen 's first electric car would be a small car due out in 2010 , but bigger ones might follow .
" we have an ambition to electrify more than just the really small cars , but also our main model series , the golf , " he said .
leohold said research into lithium-ion batteries had made big jumps , but the items were still far too expensive .
he said electric motors would never replace internal-combustion engines in some sectors , such as long-distance heavy trucks .
" at the moment it is inconceivable they could ever be powered by batteries , " he said , adding that there was still major potential to make petrol and diesel engines more efficient .
separately , the german weekly magazine focus reported saturday that a key aim behind a takeover bid from german ball-bearings company schaeffler for tyremaker continental was a plan to jointly develop electric and other energy-saving engines .
both companies make mechanical sub-systems for cars .
schaeffler takeover deal include efficiency clause focus said schaeffler chief executive juergen geissinger wanted to combine his company 's valve controls with continental 's fuel- injection and exhaust-recycling technology to make combustion engines more efficient .
they could also jointly develop gearless electric traction motors for cars , the magazine said .
in a report to appear sunday in the newspaper welt am sonntag , continental chief executive manfred wennemer opposed the takeover but said he welcomed schaeffler owning up to 20 per cent of his firm .

in an interview with dpa news agency in wolfsburg , he deflated predictions that millions of people would be driving electric cars by the middle of the 2010s as " very optimistic . "

volkswagen 's first electric car would be a small car due out in 2010 , but bigger ones might follow .

but not all were ready to accept the apology .
lobby groups for victims demanded more cash compensation and life-long care .
the 81-year-old pontiff acknowledged " the shame which we have all felt as a result of the sexual abuse of minors by some clergy and religious in this country . "
speaking at a mass with senior clergy at the cathedral where he is staying for a catholic youth festival , benedict said he was " deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have endured , and i assure them that , as their pastor , i , too , share in their suffering . "
" these misdeeds , which constitute so grave a betrayal of trust , deserve unequivocal condemnation .
they have caused great pain .
they have damaged the church 's witness , " the pope said .
the pope is in sydney for week-long world youth day celebrations , which conclude sunday with a papal mass at a city racecourse .
" in these days marked by the celebration of world youth day , we are reminded of how precious a treasure has been entrusted to us in our young people , and how great a part of the church 's mission in this country has been dedicated to their education and care , " the german-born pope said .

that 's what we need to see , those kinds of really practical social justice actions , " she added .
last week , cardinal george pell , leader of australia 's 5 million catholics , reiterated his apology to a couple blighted by a sexual abuse case in melbourne dating back to the 1980s .
the couple have demanded a meeting with the pope .
pell described as " tragic " the case of emma foster , who committed suicide earlier this year at the age of 26 .
her sister , katherine , who was also raped by melbourne priest kevin o 'donnell when she was a primary school pupil , was an alcoholic when she was rendered disabled by a drunk driver in 1999 .
" i apologized to emma in 1998 , " cardinal pell said .
" i met with her parents .
we offered them some financial help .

lobby groups for victims demanded more cash compensation and life-long care .
the 81-year-old pontiff acknowledged " the shame which we have all felt as a result of the sexual abuse of minors by some clergy and religious in this country . "
speaking at a mass with senior clergy at the cathedral where he is staying for a catholic youth festival , benedict said he was " deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have endured , and i assure them that , as their pastor , i , too , share in their suffering . "
" these misdeeds , which constitute so grave a betrayal of trust , deserve unequivocal condemnation .
they have caused great pain .
they have damaged the church 's witness , " the pope said .
the pope is in sydney for week-long world youth day celebrations , which conclude sunday with a papal mass at a city racecourse .

last week , cardinal george pell , leader of australia 's 5 million catholics , reiterated his apology to a couple blighted by a sexual abuse case in melbourne dating back to the 1980s .

pell described as " tragic " the case of emma foster , who committed suicide earlier this year at the age of 26 .
her sister , katherine , who was also raped by melbourne priest kevin o 'donnell when she was a primary school pupil , was an alcoholic when she was rendered disabled by a drunk driver in 1999 .
" i apologized to emma in 1998 , " cardinal pell said .

" the eu has exhausted its room for maneuver in agriculture and can not go any further .
so we will not be making any further concessions , " said anne-marie idrac , a french government minister in charge of foreign trade .
idrac was speaking on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of eu ministers , convened in brussels to prepare the groundwork for next week 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks where 30 nations will try to salvage a set of long-floundering trade liberalization negotiations .
those talks will address the so-called doha round , which seek to bring down global trade barriers .
the negotiations have been dragging on since the round was launched in the qatar capital in november 2001 , amid disputes over subsidies to farmers by the us and eu and tariffs on industrial goods imposed by the developing economies of asia and latin america .
the 27-member eu runs the risk of being divided , with its southern members focused primarily on the agricultural sector and its northern members more interested in the services and industrial sectors .
but idrac insisted on friday that ministers had agreed to be united in strength .
the minister also reaffirmed the member states ' backing for the eu 's chief negotiator , trade commissioner peter mandelson , in spite of the fact that her president , nicolas sarkozy , had openly criticized his anti-protectionist stance only a month ago .
eu trade chief warns of failure mandelson on thursday said that a failure to reach a deal in geneva would hamper economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says failure could hamper economic growth the commissioner also said the eu was willing to accept a compromise deal drafted by wto head pascal lamy on the gradual reduction of eu import tariffs on bananas from latin america .
the eu currently offers more favorable conditions to banana exporters from its former colonies in africa , the pacific and the caribbean -lrb- apc -rrb- .
idrac said the eu would have to " strike a balance " between the requests of latin american producers , the need to encourage economic growth in the poorer apc countries , and the interests of the eu 's own banana producers .
the minister also called for an effective " anti-concentration " clause to be included in the rounds .
the clause , which is designed to prevent developing countries from defending entire sectors of their economy , has been strongly criticized by india .
one german government minister said next week 's talks had a " 50 to 50 chance " of succeeding .
" there are still plenty of obstacles and risks , " said bernd pfaffenbach , a junior minister who acts as germany 's sherpa at group of eight meetings .
pfaffenbach said the eu was not prepared to obtain a deal " at any price . "
ireland threatens veto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has been restrained on trade since taking on the presidency while france avoided controversy on agriculture , ireland - paris ' long-time ally on agriculture - accused the european commission of offering too much as europe 's negotiator within the wto while getting little in return .
" i think they have gone way too far on agriculture , " irish trade minister john mcguinness told journalists .
" we are keenly interested in a deal ... however that deal has to be balanced . "
he also refused to rule out the possibility of ireland vetoing any trade deal that did not suit dublin , describing it as an " option . "
accounting for 20 percent of global trade , the eu is a heavy hitter in the wto , where it has long been under pressure from emerging agriculture powers and the united states to ease its farm support . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu has exhausted its room for maneuver in agriculture and can not go any further .
so we will not be making any further concessions , " said anne-marie idrac , a french government minister in charge of foreign trade .
idrac was speaking on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of eu ministers , convened in brussels to prepare the groundwork for next week 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks where 30 nations will try to salvage a set of long-floundering trade liberalization negotiations .
those talks will address the so-called doha round , which seek to bring down global trade barriers .
the negotiations have been dragging on since the round was launched in the qatar capital in november 2001 , amid disputes over subsidies to farmers by the us and eu and tariffs on industrial goods imposed by the developing economies of asia and latin america .
the 27-member eu runs the risk of being divided , with its southern members focused primarily on the agricultural sector and its northern members more interested in the services and industrial sectors .
but idrac insisted on friday that ministers had agreed to be united in strength .
the minister also reaffirmed the member states ' backing for the eu 's chief negotiator , trade commissioner peter mandelson , in spite of the fact that her president , nicolas sarkozy , had openly criticized his anti-protectionist stance only a month ago .
eu trade chief warns of failure mandelson on thursday said that a failure to reach a deal in geneva would hamper economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says failure could hamper economic growth the commissioner also said the eu was willing to accept a compromise deal drafted by wto head pascal lamy on the gradual reduction of eu import tariffs on bananas from latin america .
the eu currently offers more favorable conditions to banana exporters from its former colonies in africa , the pacific and the caribbean -lrb- apc -rrb- .
idrac said the eu would have to " strike a balance " between the requests of latin american producers , the need to encourage economic growth in the poorer apc countries , and the interests of the eu 's own banana producers .
the minister also called for an effective " anti-concentration " clause to be included in the rounds .
the clause , which is designed to prevent developing countries from defending entire sectors of their economy , has been strongly criticized by india .
one german government minister said next week 's talks had a " 50 to 50 chance " of succeeding .
" there are still plenty of obstacles and risks , " said bernd pfaffenbach , a junior minister who acts as germany 's sherpa at group of eight meetings .
pfaffenbach said the eu was not prepared to obtain a deal " at any price . "

" i think they have gone way too far on agriculture , " irish trade minister john mcguinness told journalists .
" we are keenly interested in a deal ... however that deal has to be balanced . "
he also refused to rule out the possibility of ireland vetoing any trade deal that did not suit dublin , describing it as an " option . "
accounting for 20 percent of global trade , the eu is a heavy hitter in the wto , where it has long been under pressure from emerging agriculture powers and the united states to ease its farm support . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presence of a senior us diplomat at the talks has promoted an atmopshere of cautious optimism . on behalf of the veto powers and germany , eu chief diplomat javier solana will meet iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili to talk about an offer of future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics once tehran halts its nuclear activities . the united states ' representative at the talks , undersecretary of state william burns , is the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
he will not take an active role in the talks , however . representatives from britain , france , germany , russia and chinawill also attend the meeting .
these and other countries are concerned iran could one day use its civilian nuclear program to build atom bombs , an allegation which tehran strongly denies . western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment .
iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out . rice admits to us policy shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns will make history but will not take an active role the sending of burns as a senior envoy to geneva to participate in the nuclear talks with iran 's top negotiator shows that the united states has shifted position on diplomacy with iran , secretary of state condoleezza rice said on friday . but she insisted that tehran must suspend its enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear materials for substantive talks with washington .

" and we hope this signal we 're sending , that we fully support the track that iran could take for a better relationship with the international community , is one the united states stands fully behind .

" this decision to send undersecretary -lrb- william -rrb- burns is an affirmation of the policy that we have been pursuing with our european allies ... for some time now . " rice called the move " a strong signal to the entire world that we have been very serious about this diplomacy and we will remain very serious about this diplomacy .

" but it should be very clear to everyone the united states has a condition for the beginning of negotiations with iran , and that condition remains the verifiable suspension of iran 's enrichment and reprocessing activities , " rice said . asked in an interview with cnn , excerpts of which were aired friday , whether sending burns to geneva was a major policy change , rice answered : " i acknowledge that what we 've done is to make a step that we think demonstrates to everyone our seriousness about this process . " but what has not changed is that the united states is determined to have negotiations only when iran has suspended its enrichment and reprocessing .
that 's when the united states can join . " asked if saturday 's meeting is a one-shot deal , rice replied , " this is . " one-shot deal " we have one chance to receive the iranian response .
i transmitted the proposal .
-lrb- burns -rrb- will receive the response , " she told cnn .
" he will listen , and if iran is ready to suspend , then the united states will be there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jalili was optimistic that the discussions would be positive in tehran , jalili on friday expressed optimism that weekend talks would be constructive , provided washington came with the right approach . " what is important for us is with what approach they come to the talks .
if it is with a constructive approach , and that they refrain from past mistakes , then for sure we will have constructive talks , " he was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency before leaving tehran for geneva . washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends uranium enrichment and insisted on wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate . nonetheless , it will be the first time that the united states , which severed relations with iran in 1980 after the islamic revolution , will be present in the negotiations aimed at persuading tehran to freeze uranium enrichment . russian , iranian presidents hopeful meanwhile , the presidents of iran and russia expressed hope for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis on the eve of the key talks . president mahmoud ahmadinejad and his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev held their first telephone talks late on friday , iranian state media and the kremlin said . " in the geneva negotiations ... we can examine ways to make decisions in different fields and help resolve the existing issues , " the website of iranian state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying . he also expressed satisfaction over the current state of ties between tehran and moscow , which has substantial economic interests in the islamic republic , state television said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev watches the middle east situation with interest the kremlin , meanwhile , quoted medvedev as urging iran " to cooperate fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to clarify questions remaining about the iranian nuclear program .

iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out . rice admits to us policy shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns will make history but will not take an active role the sending of burns as a senior envoy to geneva to participate in the nuclear talks with iran 's top negotiator shows that the united states has shifted position on diplomacy with iran , secretary of state condoleezza rice said on friday . but she insisted that tehran must suspend its enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear materials for substantive talks with washington . " the united states does n't have any permanent enemies , " rice said in response to a reporter 's question on the unexpected move to send a diplomat to meet directly with jalili in geneva . " and we hope this signal we 're sending , that we fully support the track that iran could take for a better relationship with the international community , is one the united states stands fully behind . " " we have been very clear that any country can change course , " rice added .
" this decision to send undersecretary -lrb- william -rrb- burns is an affirmation of the policy that we have been pursuing with our european allies ... for some time now . " rice called the move " a strong signal to the entire world that we have been very serious about this diplomacy and we will remain very serious about this diplomacy . " rice pointed out that she had endorsed the proposal from the so-called p5 plus one - the united states , france , britain , china , russia and germany - on incentives to advance talks with iran on halting its nuclear program . conditions remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said that the us still has conditions for negotiations she called sending burns to geneva to meet with jalili and eu foreign policy chief javier solana the " book end " to that process . " but it should be very clear to everyone the united states has a condition for the beginning of negotiations with iran , and that condition remains the verifiable suspension of iran 's enrichment and reprocessing activities , " rice said . asked in an interview with cnn , excerpts of which were aired friday , whether sending burns to geneva was a major policy change , rice answered : " i acknowledge that what we 've done is to make a step that we think demonstrates to everyone our seriousness about this process . " but what has not changed is that the united states is determined to have negotiations only when iran has suspended its enrichment and reprocessing .
that 's when the united states can join . " asked if saturday 's meeting is a one-shot deal , rice replied , " this is . " one-shot deal " we have one chance to receive the iranian response .
i transmitted the proposal .
-lrb- burns -rrb- will receive the response , " she told cnn .
" he will listen , and if iran is ready to suspend , then the united states will be there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jalili was optimistic that the discussions would be positive in tehran , jalili on friday expressed optimism that weekend talks would be constructive , provided washington came with the right approach . " what is important for us is with what approach they come to the talks .
if it is with a constructive approach , and that they refrain from past mistakes , then for sure we will have constructive talks , " he was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency before leaving tehran for geneva . washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends uranium enrichment and insisted on wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate . nonetheless , it will be the first time that the united states , which severed relations with iran in 1980 after the islamic revolution , will be present in the negotiations aimed at persuading tehran to freeze uranium enrichment . russian , iranian presidents hopeful meanwhile , the presidents of iran and russia expressed hope for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis on the eve of the key talks . president mahmoud ahmadinejad and his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev held their first telephone talks late on friday , iranian state media and the kremlin said . " in the geneva negotiations ... we can examine ways to make decisions in different fields and help resolve the existing issues , " the website of iranian state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying . he also expressed satisfaction over the current state of ties between tehran and moscow , which has substantial economic interests in the islamic republic , state television said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev watches the middle east situation with interest the kremlin , meanwhile , quoted medvedev as urging iran " to cooperate fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to clarify questions remaining about the iranian nuclear program . " " the russian president reiterated his firm position on resolving the situation surrounding iran 's nuclear program only by political and diplomatic means , " it added . medvedev told ahmadinejad he hoped for a " substantive and constructive dialogue " in geneva on saturday , it said . russia is one of the six world powers that last month gave iran a proposal offering it full negotiations on a range of incentives if it suspends its sensitive uranium enrichment operations . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the olympic tournament is an under-23 event with three older players allowed per team .
" the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " ioc president jacques rogge told dpa news agency during an interview in lausanne , switzerland .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .

the rule applies to all under-23 players - unless they do n't want to play at the games .
the olympic tournament is an under-23 event with three older players allowed per team .
" the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " ioc president jacques rogge told dpa news agency during an interview in lausanne , switzerland .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .
they sent a letter a couple of days ago to remind them of that . "
fifa spokesman alain leiblang confirmed the letter to dpa news agency on friday , saying : " we have informed the clubs that they must release the under-23 players . "

in an interview with dpa news agency in wolfsburg , he deflated predictions that millions of people would be driving electric cars by the middle of the 2010s as " very optimistic . "
leohold said volkswagen would sell electric models , but cautioned , " it will take 20 to 25 years before electric cars achieve a market share of more than 10 per cent . "
volkswagen 's first electric car would be a small car due out in 2010 , but bigger ones might follow .
" we have an ambition to electrify more than just the really small cars , but also our main model series , the golf , " he said .
leohold said research into lithium-ion batteries had made big jumps , but the items were still far too expensive .
he said electric motors would never replace internal-combustion engines in some sectors , such as long-distance heavy trucks .
" at the moment it is inconceivable they could ever be powered by batteries , " he said , adding that there was still major potential to make petrol and diesel engines more efficient .
separately , the german weekly magazine focus reported saturday that a key aim behind a takeover bid from german ball-bearings company schaeffler for tyremaker continental was a plan to jointly develop electric and other energy-saving engines .
both companies make mechanical sub-systems for cars .
schaeffler takeover deal include efficiency clause focus said schaeffler chief executive juergen geissinger wanted to combine his company 's valve controls with continental 's fuel- injection and exhaust-recycling technology to make combustion engines more efficient .

lobby groups for victims demanded more cash compensation and life-long care .
the 81-year-old pontiff acknowledged " the shame which we have all felt as a result of the sexual abuse of minors by some clergy and religious in this country . "
speaking at a mass with senior clergy at the cathedral where he is staying for a catholic youth festival , benedict said he was " deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have endured , and i assure them that , as their pastor , i , too , share in their suffering . "
" these misdeeds , which constitute so grave a betrayal of trust , deserve unequivocal condemnation .
they have caused great pain .
they have damaged the church 's witness , " the pope said .
the pope is in sydney for week-long world youth day celebrations , which conclude sunday with a papal mass at a city racecourse .

pell described as " tragic " the case of emma foster , who committed suicide earlier this year at the age of 26 .
her sister , katherine , who was also raped by melbourne priest kevin o 'donnell when she was a primary school pupil , was an alcoholic when she was rendered disabled by a drunk driver in 1999 .
" i apologized to emma in 1998 , " cardinal pell said .
" i met with her parents .

" i am awaiting a concrete and detailed explanation from germany , " vladimir spidla told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily during a conference in bonn .
" germany must provide -lrb- an explanation -rrb- , then i will see if the arguments are convincing , " the former czech prime minister added .
earlier this week , the german government said it would ease rules for highly qualified immigrants from new eu states seeking work to fill yawning gaps in the german job market .
the government also reduced the minimum wage highly-skilled foreigners have to earn to secure a work permit to 63,600 euros -lrb- $ 101,200 -rrb- per year from 86,400 euros .
welcome mat for skilled workers like many industrialized nations , germany is struggling to fill thousands of vacant jobs requiring a high level of skills and expertise .
german business have long complained of a dearth of skilled workers in the country and the new measures are an effort to plug a shortage of skilled labour in sectors such as engineering and technology .

however , the proposals include keeping germany 's labor market closed to unskilled workers from new eu member states for two years longer than planned .
germany is one of a handful of eu states still restricting workers from nations that joined the bloc in 2004 .
unskilled workers from the 10 countries that joined the eu in may , 2004 , excluding cyprus and malta , will not be allowed in until april 2011 , compared with an original date of the end of april , 2009 .
cheap workers from romania and bulgaria will continue to be excluded until the end of 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spidla wants germany to explain its bar on unskilled workers when the eu expanded to take in 10 new members in 2004 , berlin at the time cited fears that a flood of cheap labor would put germans out of work due to germany 's geographic proximity to the new member states .
the german unemployment rate has since fallen from the double-digit range to 7.5 percent in june .
spidla said that while eu states could maintain restrictions until 2011 , " each government must prove there are risks of serious disruption to its labor market .

soccer clubs have received a stern warning from the ruling body fifa and the international olympic committee that they must release players for the beijing games . fifa and the ioc said that clubs who refuse to let players go to the august 8-24 olympics will have these players suspended from club matches for the period .
the rule applies to all under-23 players - unless they do n't want to play at the games .
the olympic tournament is an under-23 event with three older players allowed per team .
" the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " ioc president jacques rogge told dpa news agency during an interview in lausanne , switzerland .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .
they sent a letter a couple of days ago to remind them of that . "
fifa spokesman alain leiblang confirmed the letter to dpa news agency on friday , saying : " we have informed the clubs that they must release the under-23 players . "
german clubs keeping players at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's rafinha is one of the bundesliga stars staying put while brazil 's ronaldinho and lionel messi of argentina are among the stars to play in beijing , others like brazil 's diego and rafinha , or belgium 's vincent kompany are not to be released by their german clubs , werder bremen , schalke and sv hamburg , respectively .
and ac milan vice-president alberto galliano said that his club would have not let newly-hired ronaldinho go to beijing had he been at milan before the player 's transfer from barcelona this week .
" we respect the obligation that he took on before he came to milan .
if he had already been a rossonero , we would not have let him go , but as he is joining us later we will let him go to the olympics , " said galliano .
milan coach carlo ancelotti even saw the bright side of it , saying : " it is a chance for him to find his fitness .
when he comes back he will be ready .
he will only need to learn his place in our system . "
bremen stand firm on diego diego , by contrast , is not to be a fellow-midfielder for brazil as many clubs disagree with the views of fifa and the ioc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego is said to be very angry about his club 's decision " there is no such rule according to the statutes .
we have no written statement from fifa or the ioc that we have to release someone , " said bremen sports director klaus allofs .
the clubs argue that the olympic tournament is not on the official fifa calendar -lrb- unlike the women 's event -rrb- and that it is therefore up to them to decide whether their men can play for gold or not .
rogge said he can understand the clubs but at the same time wants the football tournament to be as attractive as possible .
" their clubs have other motives , the regular calendar , champions league qualifying and then they do n't want to send them .
they are afraid they could be injured , " rogge said .
" i am very happy that the big players want to participate in the games , ronaldinho wants to go to the games .
so there are a lot of great players who want to go .
the games are something special for them . "
rogge said he would prefer no age restrictions to have all top stars compete but that he respects the under-23 agreement signed between ifa and the ioc in 1993 .
" we are happy to have soccer for various reasons .
it is the most popular sport in the world , it is a success in the olympic games , they are number three in audience among the 28 sports and they are number one in the sale of tickets , " said rogge . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presence of a senior us diplomat at the talks has promoted an atmopshere of cautious optimism . on behalf of the veto powers and germany , eu chief diplomat javier solana will meet iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili to talk about an offer of future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics once tehran halts its nuclear activities . the united states ' representative at the talks , undersecretary of state william burns , is the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
he will not take an active role in the talks , however . representatives from britain , france , germany , russia and chinawill also attend the meeting .
these and other countries are concerned iran could one day use its civilian nuclear program to build atom bombs , an allegation which tehran strongly denies . western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment .
iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out . rice admits to us policy shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns will make history but will not take an active role the sending of burns as a senior envoy to geneva to participate in the nuclear talks with iran 's top negotiator shows that the united states has shifted position on diplomacy with iran , secretary of state condoleezza rice said on friday . but she insisted that tehran must suspend its enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear materials for substantive talks with washington . " the united states does n't have any permanent enemies , " rice said in response to a reporter 's question on the unexpected move to send a diplomat to meet directly with jalili in geneva . " and we hope this signal we 're sending , that we fully support the track that iran could take for a better relationship with the international community , is one the united states stands fully behind . " " we have been very clear that any country can change course , " rice added .
" this decision to send undersecretary -lrb- william -rrb- burns is an affirmation of the policy that we have been pursuing with our european allies ... for some time now . " rice called the move " a strong signal to the entire world that we have been very serious about this diplomacy and we will remain very serious about this diplomacy . " rice pointed out that she had endorsed the proposal from the so-called p5 plus one - the united states , france , britain , china , russia and germany - on incentives to advance talks with iran on halting its nuclear program . conditions remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said that the us still has conditions for negotiations she called sending burns to geneva to meet with jalili and eu foreign policy chief javier solana the " book end " to that process . " but it should be very clear to everyone the united states has a condition for the beginning of negotiations with iran , and that condition remains the verifiable suspension of iran 's enrichment and reprocessing activities , " rice said . asked in an interview with cnn , excerpts of which were aired friday , whether sending burns to geneva was a major policy change , rice answered : " i acknowledge that what we 've done is to make a step that we think demonstrates to everyone our seriousness about this process . " but what has not changed is that the united states is determined to have negotiations only when iran has suspended its enrichment and reprocessing .
that 's when the united states can join . " asked if saturday 's meeting is a one-shot deal , rice replied , " this is . " one-shot deal " we have one chance to receive the iranian response .
i transmitted the proposal .
-lrb- burns -rrb- will receive the response , " she told cnn .
" he will listen , and if iran is ready to suspend , then the united states will be there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jalili was optimistic that the discussions would be positive in tehran , jalili on friday expressed optimism that weekend talks would be constructive , provided washington came with the right approach . " what is important for us is with what approach they come to the talks .
if it is with a constructive approach , and that they refrain from past mistakes , then for sure we will have constructive talks , " he was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency before leaving tehran for geneva . washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends uranium enrichment and insisted on wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate . nonetheless , it will be the first time that the united states , which severed relations with iran in 1980 after the islamic revolution , will be present in the negotiations aimed at persuading tehran to freeze uranium enrichment . russian , iranian presidents hopeful meanwhile , the presidents of iran and russia expressed hope for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis on the eve of the key talks . president mahmoud ahmadinejad and his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev held their first telephone talks late on friday , iranian state media and the kremlin said . " in the geneva negotiations ... we can examine ways to make decisions in different fields and help resolve the existing issues , " the website of iranian state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying . he also expressed satisfaction over the current state of ties between tehran and moscow , which has substantial economic interests in the islamic republic , state television said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev watches the middle east situation with interest the kremlin , meanwhile , quoted medvedev as urging iran " to cooperate fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to clarify questions remaining about the iranian nuclear program .

the presence of a senior us diplomat at the talks has promoted an atmopshere of cautious optimism . on behalf of the veto powers and germany , eu chief diplomat javier solana will meet iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili to talk about an offer of future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics once tehran halts its nuclear activities . the united states ' representative at the talks , undersecretary of state william burns , is the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
he will not take an active role in the talks , however . representatives from britain , france , germany , russia and chinawill also attend the meeting .
these and other countries are concerned iran could one day use its civilian nuclear program to build atom bombs , an allegation which tehran strongly denies . western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment .
iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out . rice admits to us policy shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns will make history but will not take an active role the sending of burns as a senior envoy to geneva to participate in the nuclear talks with iran 's top negotiator shows that the united states has shifted position on diplomacy with iran , secretary of state condoleezza rice said on friday . but she insisted that tehran must suspend its enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear materials for substantive talks with washington . " the united states does n't have any permanent enemies , " rice said in response to a reporter 's question on the unexpected move to send a diplomat to meet directly with jalili in geneva . " and we hope this signal we 're sending , that we fully support the track that iran could take for a better relationship with the international community , is one the united states stands fully behind .

the rule applies to all under-23 players - unless they do n't want to play at the games .
the olympic tournament is an under-23 event with three older players allowed per team .
" the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " ioc president jacques rogge told dpa news agency during an interview in lausanne , switzerland .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .
they sent a letter a couple of days ago to remind them of that . "

the clubs argue that the olympic tournament is not on the official fifa calendar -lrb- unlike the women 's event -rrb- and that it is therefore up to them to decide whether their men can play for gold or not .

more than 1.2 million flocked to a roughly one-mile long main road which had been closed to allow the scantily dressed mostly young people to shake to techno music blasted from 37 floats .
some 250 djs are taking part in the event , which is expected to last until midnight saturday .
driven by electronic dance music , the spectacle has gained a reputation over the past two decades for loudness , outlandish garb , marathon dancing , and , by some accounts , widespread use of the drug ecstasy .
organizers said 15 of the bands came from abroad , including from australia , south korea , ukraine and turkey .
each band occupied a float .
the amplifiers required cooling to stop them overheating .

more than 1.2 million flocked to a roughly one-mile long main road which had been closed to allow the scantily dressed mostly young people to shake to techno music blasted from 37 floats .
some 250 djs are taking part in the event , which is expected to last until midnight saturday .
driven by electronic dance music , the spectacle has gained a reputation over the past two decades for loudness , outlandish garb , marathon dancing , and , by some accounts , widespread use of the drug ecstasy .
organizers said 15 of the bands came from abroad , including from australia , south korea , ukraine and turkey .
each band occupied a float .
the amplifiers required cooling to stop them overheating .

" the eu has exhausted its room for maneuver in agriculture and can not go any further .
so we will not be making any further concessions , " said anne-marie idrac , a french government minister in charge of foreign trade .
idrac was speaking on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of eu ministers , convened in brussels to prepare the groundwork for next week 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks where 30 nations will try to salvage a set of long-floundering trade liberalization negotiations .
those talks will address the so-called doha round , which seek to bring down global trade barriers .
the negotiations have been dragging on since the round was launched in the qatar capital in november 2001 , amid disputes over subsidies to farmers by the us and eu and tariffs on industrial goods imposed by the developing economies of asia and latin america .
the 27-member eu runs the risk of being divided , with its southern members focused primarily on the agricultural sector and its northern members more interested in the services and industrial sectors .
but idrac insisted on friday that ministers had agreed to be united in strength .
the minister also reaffirmed the member states ' backing for the eu 's chief negotiator , trade commissioner peter mandelson , in spite of the fact that her president , nicolas sarkozy , had openly criticized his anti-protectionist stance only a month ago .
eu trade chief warns of failure mandelson on thursday said that a failure to reach a deal in geneva would hamper economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says failure could hamper economic growth the commissioner also said the eu was willing to accept a compromise deal drafted by wto head pascal lamy on the gradual reduction of eu import tariffs on bananas from latin america .
the eu currently offers more favorable conditions to banana exporters from its former colonies in africa , the pacific and the caribbean -lrb- apc -rrb- .
idrac said the eu would have to " strike a balance " between the requests of latin american producers , the need to encourage economic growth in the poorer apc countries , and the interests of the eu 's own banana producers .
the minister also called for an effective " anti-concentration " clause to be included in the rounds .
the clause , which is designed to prevent developing countries from defending entire sectors of their economy , has been strongly criticized by india .
one german government minister said next week 's talks had a " 50 to 50 chance " of succeeding .
" there are still plenty of obstacles and risks , " said bernd pfaffenbach , a junior minister who acts as germany 's sherpa at group of eight meetings .
pfaffenbach said the eu was not prepared to obtain a deal " at any price . "

" i think they have gone way too far on agriculture , " irish trade minister john mcguinness told journalists .
" we are keenly interested in a deal ... however that deal has to be balanced . "
he also refused to rule out the possibility of ireland vetoing any trade deal that did not suit dublin , describing it as an " option . "

" the eu has exhausted its room for maneuver in agriculture and can not go any further .
so we will not be making any further concessions , " said anne-marie idrac , a french government minister in charge of foreign trade .
idrac was speaking on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of eu ministers , convened in brussels to prepare the groundwork for next week 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks where 30 nations will try to salvage a set of long-floundering trade liberalization negotiations .
those talks will address the so-called doha round , which seek to bring down global trade barriers .
the negotiations have been dragging on since the round was launched in the qatar capital in november 2001 , amid disputes over subsidies to farmers by the us and eu and tariffs on industrial goods imposed by the developing economies of asia and latin america .
the 27-member eu runs the risk of being divided , with its southern members focused primarily on the agricultural sector and its northern members more interested in the services and industrial sectors .
but idrac insisted on friday that ministers had agreed to be united in strength .
the minister also reaffirmed the member states ' backing for the eu 's chief negotiator , trade commissioner peter mandelson , in spite of the fact that her president , nicolas sarkozy , had openly criticized his anti-protectionist stance only a month ago .
eu trade chief warns of failure mandelson on thursday said that a failure to reach a deal in geneva would hamper economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says failure could hamper economic growth the commissioner also said the eu was willing to accept a compromise deal drafted by wto head pascal lamy on the gradual reduction of eu import tariffs on bananas from latin america .
the eu currently offers more favorable conditions to banana exporters from its former colonies in africa , the pacific and the caribbean -lrb- apc -rrb- .
idrac said the eu would have to " strike a balance " between the requests of latin american producers , the need to encourage economic growth in the poorer apc countries , and the interests of the eu 's own banana producers .
the minister also called for an effective " anti-concentration " clause to be included in the rounds .
the clause , which is designed to prevent developing countries from defending entire sectors of their economy , has been strongly criticized by india .
one german government minister said next week 's talks had a " 50 to 50 chance " of succeeding .
" there are still plenty of obstacles and risks , " said bernd pfaffenbach , a junior minister who acts as germany 's sherpa at group of eight meetings .
pfaffenbach said the eu was not prepared to obtain a deal " at any price . "
ireland threatens veto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has been restrained on trade since taking on the presidency while france avoided controversy on agriculture , ireland - paris ' long-time ally on agriculture - accused the european commission of offering too much as europe 's negotiator within the wto while getting little in return .
" i think they have gone way too far on agriculture , " irish trade minister john mcguinness told journalists .
" we are keenly interested in a deal ... however that deal has to be balanced . "
he also refused to rule out the possibility of ireland vetoing any trade deal that did not suit dublin , describing it as an " option . "
accounting for 20 percent of global trade , the eu is a heavy hitter in the wto , where it has long been under pressure from emerging agriculture powers and the united states to ease its farm support . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than 1.2 million flocked to a roughly one-mile long main road which had been closed to allow the scantily dressed mostly young people to shake to techno music blasted from 37 floats .
some 250 djs are taking part in the event , which is expected to last until midnight saturday .
driven by electronic dance music , the spectacle has gained a reputation over the past two decades for loudness , outlandish garb , marathon dancing , and , by some accounts , widespread use of the drug ecstasy .
organizers said 15 of the bands came from abroad , including from australia , south korea , ukraine and turkey .
each band occupied a float .
the amplifiers required cooling to stop them overheating .

michel , 21 , from the south-east of germany , was just as gushing as he described how he and his girlfriend had arrived in dortmund on the eve of the parade with nowhere to stay and had danced much of the night in a club .
" we made new friends who let us sleep -lrb- with 10 others -rrb- in a two-bed room at a bed-and-breakfast hotel .

highway to love the parade was being held in the west of germany for a second year after leaving berlin , where the annual spectacle began in 1989 .

dj westbam , first up of 250 disc jockeys mixing the music , opened the event with his new highway to love " hymn . "
promoters said the parade could be seen live by satellite broadcast in 53 nations of the world .

" i am awaiting a concrete and detailed explanation from germany , " vladimir spidla told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily during a conference in bonn .
" germany must provide -lrb- an explanation -rrb- , then i will see if the arguments are convincing , " the former czech prime minister added .
earlier this week , the german government said it would ease rules for highly qualified immigrants from new eu states seeking work to fill yawning gaps in the german job market .
the government also reduced the minimum wage highly-skilled foreigners have to earn to secure a work permit to 63,600 euros -lrb- $ 101,200 -rrb- per year from 86,400 euros .
welcome mat for skilled workers like many industrialized nations , germany is struggling to fill thousands of vacant jobs requiring a high level of skills and expertise .

raw deal for unskilled immigrants ?
however , the proposals include keeping germany 's labor market closed to unskilled workers from new eu member states for two years longer than planned .
germany is one of a handful of eu states still restricting workers from nations that joined the bloc in 2004 .
unskilled workers from the 10 countries that joined the eu in may , 2004 , excluding cyprus and malta , will not be allowed in until april 2011 , compared with an original date of the end of april , 2009 .
cheap workers from romania and bulgaria will continue to be excluded until the end of 2011 .

the german unemployment rate has since fallen from the double-digit range to 7.5 percent in june .

whereas once life expectancy hovered around 35 , now that number ’ s closer to 80 .
but will we all live to 100 ? it 's friday afternoon in the small town of bad lippspringe and 92-year-old anneliese bee is paying a visit to her daughter , granddaughter and great-granddaughter .
four generations in one room is uncommon , bee knows .
“ as old as i am - and still able to get around - that 's a rarity , ” said bee , who lives in her own apartment and regularly cooks lunch for her family .
“ my mother died at 68 , my father-in-law at 70 and my mother-in-law at 68 , ” said bee .
but as bee has grown older , the life expectancy of those living in industrialized lands has also increased .
it 's not as unusual as it once was to see people living to 80 or 90 .
“ over the last several years , we 've seen the average life expectancy continuously increase , ” said bettina sommer of the federal statistics office in wiesbaden .
“ if we go back to 130 years ago , we see the average life expectancy of a newborn has nearly doubled . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centenarian rosa richter received government congratulations on her 100th sommer , who heads a working group dealing specifically with life expectancy averages , says that a female born in germany today can anticipate seeing the ripe old age of 82 .
male newborns can expect to reach 76 on average .
the questionable value of statistics of course , these values are purely hypothetical - a palm reading of what 's possible in the future , if you will .
it remains impossible to predict on an individual basis just how long a person might live .
“ naturally , not all people who lived 130 years ago died at the age of 38 , ” said sommer .
“ many people died young , but there 's a good chance that others lived to be more than 60 or 70 years old . ”
the statistics likewise need to be adjusted according to infant mortality rates .
a high early death rate can decrease life expectancy tremendously .
one statistical possibility considers the notion that while two of four people live to be 80 years old , the other two die at birth .
that model makes for an average age of 40 .
at the same time , if we consider a group of four people in which only one person dies at birth and the other three reach the age of 80 , the life expectancy has suddenly jumped to 60 .
some countries moving in the opposite direction sinking infant mortality rates , then , have a lot to do with increasing life expectancy .
and in many countries , those rates have gone down thanks to medical advancements .
threats to infants and young children have substantially decreased due to the development of vaccines and antibiotics .
“ that 's definitely contributed to the sharp increase in life expectancy , ” said sommer .
“ and over the last century , the lifespan of older people has also increased . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children born in southern africa have greater problems aging at least that 's true for germany , which ranks among the countries with the longest average life .
unfortunately , that life increase has n't reached everywhere in the world , said sommer .
“ while these advancements over the last century have been felt across the world , there are likewise countries which are moving in the opposite direction . ”
in lands where aids is rampant , where many young people lose their lives in that battle , the life expectancy is sinking .
in southern african nations , the average lifespan is under 40 years .
the trend troubles many and aid agencies are working hard against the aids epidemic while also struggling to bring down infant mortality rates .
your chances of growing older increase with age while it may sound like common sense , the common belief now is that for every year you 've lived through , you 've increased your life expectancy .
the older a person grows , the better his or her chances are to become even older .
a 20-year-old can expect a higher lifespan than a newborn child because the 20-year-old has lived through the dangers of childhood and adolescence .
“ whoever is 80 today has a good chance of turning 81 tomorrow .
but a newborn first has to reach the age of 80 , ” said sommer .
that 's proven no problem for the spry and spirited 92-year-old anneliese bee .
but although she 's feeling mentally at her peak , her body has begun to show its age .
she 's grown hard of hearing , has osteoarthrosis and is a bit unsteady on her feet .

whereas once life expectancy hovered around 35 , now that number ’ s closer to 80 .
but will we all live to 100 ? it 's friday afternoon in the small town of bad lippspringe and 92-year-old anneliese bee is paying a visit to her daughter , granddaughter and great-granddaughter .
four generations in one room is uncommon , bee knows .
“ as old as i am - and still able to get around - that 's a rarity , ” said bee , who lives in her own apartment and regularly cooks lunch for her family .
“ my mother died at 68 , my father-in-law at 70 and my mother-in-law at 68 , ” said bee .
but as bee has grown older , the life expectancy of those living in industrialized lands has also increased .
it 's not as unusual as it once was to see people living to 80 or 90 .
“ over the last several years , we 've seen the average life expectancy continuously increase , ” said bettina sommer of the federal statistics office in wiesbaden .
“ if we go back to 130 years ago , we see the average life expectancy of a newborn has nearly doubled . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centenarian rosa richter received government congratulations on her 100th sommer , who heads a working group dealing specifically with life expectancy averages , says that a female born in germany today can anticipate seeing the ripe old age of 82 .

“ many people died young , but there 's a good chance that others lived to be more than 60 or 70 years old . ”
the statistics likewise need to be adjusted according to infant mortality rates .
a high early death rate can decrease life expectancy tremendously .
one statistical possibility considers the notion that while two of four people live to be 80 years old , the other two die at birth .
that model makes for an average age of 40 .
at the same time , if we consider a group of four people in which only one person dies at birth and the other three reach the age of 80 , the life expectancy has suddenly jumped to 60 .
some countries moving in the opposite direction sinking infant mortality rates , then , have a lot to do with increasing life expectancy .
and in many countries , those rates have gone down thanks to medical advancements .
threats to infants and young children have substantially decreased due to the development of vaccines and antibiotics .
“ that 's definitely contributed to the sharp increase in life expectancy , ” said sommer .

whereas once life expectancy hovered around 35 , now that number ’ s closer to 80 .
but will we all live to 100 ? it 's friday afternoon in the small town of bad lippspringe and 92-year-old anneliese bee is paying a visit to her daughter , granddaughter and great-granddaughter .
four generations in one room is uncommon , bee knows .
“ as old as i am - and still able to get around - that 's a rarity , ” said bee , who lives in her own apartment and regularly cooks lunch for her family .
“ my mother died at 68 , my father-in-law at 70 and my mother-in-law at 68 , ” said bee .
but as bee has grown older , the life expectancy of those living in industrialized lands has also increased .
it 's not as unusual as it once was to see people living to 80 or 90 .
“ over the last several years , we 've seen the average life expectancy continuously increase , ” said bettina sommer of the federal statistics office in wiesbaden .
“ if we go back to 130 years ago , we see the average life expectancy of a newborn has nearly doubled . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centenarian rosa richter received government congratulations on her 100th sommer , who heads a working group dealing specifically with life expectancy averages , says that a female born in germany today can anticipate seeing the ripe old age of 82 .
male newborns can expect to reach 76 on average .
the questionable value of statistics of course , these values are purely hypothetical - a palm reading of what 's possible in the future , if you will .
it remains impossible to predict on an individual basis just how long a person might live .
“ naturally , not all people who lived 130 years ago died at the age of 38 , ” said sommer .
“ many people died young , but there 's a good chance that others lived to be more than 60 or 70 years old . ”
the statistics likewise need to be adjusted according to infant mortality rates .
a high early death rate can decrease life expectancy tremendously .
one statistical possibility considers the notion that while two of four people live to be 80 years old , the other two die at birth .
that model makes for an average age of 40 .
at the same time , if we consider a group of four people in which only one person dies at birth and the other three reach the age of 80 , the life expectancy has suddenly jumped to 60 .
some countries moving in the opposite direction sinking infant mortality rates , then , have a lot to do with increasing life expectancy .
and in many countries , those rates have gone down thanks to medical advancements .
threats to infants and young children have substantially decreased due to the development of vaccines and antibiotics .
“ that 's definitely contributed to the sharp increase in life expectancy , ” said sommer .
“ and over the last century , the lifespan of older people has also increased . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children born in southern africa have greater problems aging at least that 's true for germany , which ranks among the countries with the longest average life .
unfortunately , that life increase has n't reached everywhere in the world , said sommer .
“ while these advancements over the last century have been felt across the world , there are likewise countries which are moving in the opposite direction . ”
in lands where aids is rampant , where many young people lose their lives in that battle , the life expectancy is sinking .
in southern african nations , the average lifespan is under 40 years .
the trend troubles many and aid agencies are working hard against the aids epidemic while also struggling to bring down infant mortality rates .
your chances of growing older increase with age while it may sound like common sense , the common belief now is that for every year you 've lived through , you 've increased your life expectancy .
the older a person grows , the better his or her chances are to become even older .
a 20-year-old can expect a higher lifespan than a newborn child because the 20-year-old has lived through the dangers of childhood and adolescence .
“ whoever is 80 today has a good chance of turning 81 tomorrow .
but a newborn first has to reach the age of 80 , ” said sommer .

" i am awaiting a concrete and detailed explanation from germany , " vladimir spidla told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily during a conference in bonn .
" germany must provide -lrb- an explanation -rrb- , then i will see if the arguments are convincing , " the former czech prime minister added .
earlier this week , the german government said it would ease rules for highly qualified immigrants from new eu states seeking work to fill yawning gaps in the german job market .
the government also reduced the minimum wage highly-skilled foreigners have to earn to secure a work permit to 63,600 euros -lrb- $ 101,200 -rrb- per year from 86,400 euros .
welcome mat for skilled workers like many industrialized nations , germany is struggling to fill thousands of vacant jobs requiring a high level of skills and expertise .
german business have long complained of a dearth of skilled workers in the country and the new measures are an effort to plug a shortage of skilled labour in sectors such as engineering and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces a huge shortage of engineers the shortage of computer technicians , engineers and other skilled workers is costing europe 's largest economy around 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.8 billion -rrb- a year , according to estimates by the government and the dihk chambers of industry and commerce .
" we have taken a step toward making germany more competitive internationally , " social democrat labor minister olaf scholz said earlier this week .
" we are putting the conditions in place so that people can come here who can contribute to creating economic growth . "
raw deal for unskilled immigrants ?
however , the proposals include keeping germany 's labor market closed to unskilled workers from new eu member states for two years longer than planned .
germany is one of a handful of eu states still restricting workers from nations that joined the bloc in 2004 .
unskilled workers from the 10 countries that joined the eu in may , 2004 , excluding cyprus and malta , will not be allowed in until april 2011 , compared with an original date of the end of april , 2009 .
cheap workers from romania and bulgaria will continue to be excluded until the end of 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spidla wants germany to explain its bar on unskilled workers when the eu expanded to take in 10 new members in 2004 , berlin at the time cited fears that a flood of cheap labor would put germans out of work due to germany 's geographic proximity to the new member states .
the german unemployment rate has since fallen from the double-digit range to 7.5 percent in june .
spidla said that while eu states could maintain restrictions until 2011 , " each government must prove there are risks of serious disruption to its labor market .

" i am awaiting a concrete and detailed explanation from germany , " vladimir spidla told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily during a conference in bonn .
" germany must provide -lrb- an explanation -rrb- , then i will see if the arguments are convincing , " the former czech prime minister added .
earlier this week , the german government said it would ease rules for highly qualified immigrants from new eu states seeking work to fill yawning gaps in the german job market .
the government also reduced the minimum wage highly-skilled foreigners have to earn to secure a work permit to 63,600 euros -lrb- $ 101,200 -rrb- per year from 86,400 euros .
welcome mat for skilled workers like many industrialized nations , germany is struggling to fill thousands of vacant jobs requiring a high level of skills and expertise .
german business have long complained of a dearth of skilled workers in the country and the new measures are an effort to plug a shortage of skilled labour in sectors such as engineering and technology .

" we are putting the conditions in place so that people can come here who can contribute to creating economic growth . "
raw deal for unskilled immigrants ?
however , the proposals include keeping germany 's labor market closed to unskilled workers from new eu member states for two years longer than planned .
germany is one of a handful of eu states still restricting workers from nations that joined the bloc in 2004 .
unskilled workers from the 10 countries that joined the eu in may , 2004 , excluding cyprus and malta , will not be allowed in until april 2011 , compared with an original date of the end of april , 2009 .
cheap workers from romania and bulgaria will continue to be excluded until the end of 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spidla wants germany to explain its bar on unskilled workers when the eu expanded to take in 10 new members in 2004 , berlin at the time cited fears that a flood of cheap labor would put germans out of work due to germany 's geographic proximity to the new member states .
the german unemployment rate has since fallen from the double-digit range to 7.5 percent in june .
spidla said that while eu states could maintain restrictions until 2011 , " each government must prove there are risks of serious disruption to its labor market .

" i am awaiting a concrete and detailed explanation from germany , " vladimir spidla told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily during a conference in bonn .
" germany must provide -lrb- an explanation -rrb- , then i will see if the arguments are convincing , " the former czech prime minister added .
earlier this week , the german government said it would ease rules for highly qualified immigrants from new eu states seeking work to fill yawning gaps in the german job market .
the government also reduced the minimum wage highly-skilled foreigners have to earn to secure a work permit to 63,600 euros -lrb- $ 101,200 -rrb- per year from 86,400 euros .
welcome mat for skilled workers like many industrialized nations , germany is struggling to fill thousands of vacant jobs requiring a high level of skills and expertise .
german business have long complained of a dearth of skilled workers in the country and the new measures are an effort to plug a shortage of skilled labour in sectors such as engineering and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces a huge shortage of engineers the shortage of computer technicians , engineers and other skilled workers is costing europe 's largest economy around 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.8 billion -rrb- a year , according to estimates by the government and the dihk chambers of industry and commerce .
" we have taken a step toward making germany more competitive internationally , " social democrat labor minister olaf scholz said earlier this week .
" we are putting the conditions in place so that people can come here who can contribute to creating economic growth . "
raw deal for unskilled immigrants ?
however , the proposals include keeping germany 's labor market closed to unskilled workers from new eu member states for two years longer than planned .
germany is one of a handful of eu states still restricting workers from nations that joined the bloc in 2004 .
unskilled workers from the 10 countries that joined the eu in may , 2004 , excluding cyprus and malta , will not be allowed in until april 2011 , compared with an original date of the end of april , 2009 .
cheap workers from romania and bulgaria will continue to be excluded until the end of 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spidla wants germany to explain its bar on unskilled workers when the eu expanded to take in 10 new members in 2004 , berlin at the time cited fears that a flood of cheap labor would put germans out of work due to germany 's geographic proximity to the new member states .
the german unemployment rate has since fallen from the double-digit range to 7.5 percent in june .
spidla said that while eu states could maintain restrictions until 2011 , " each government must prove there are risks of serious disruption to its labor market .

schaeuble shut down german offices of danish-based roj tv earlier this year and declared it no longer had a licence to broadcast in germany , although its satellite signal can still be easily picked up by viewers inside germany .
the kurdish rebel group pkk this month kidnapped three german mountaineers on mount ararat in eastern turkey in anger at the move .
focus said the secret bka analysis suggested that " a personal risk to the minister is conceivable . "
focus said the bka had also advised the german foreign ministry to expand its current " urgent " warning against travel by germans to kurdish areas .
it urged the ministry to advise vacationers against visiting any part of turkey at all . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

whereas once life expectancy hovered around 35 , now that number ’ s closer to 80 .
but will we all live to 100 ? it 's friday afternoon in the small town of bad lippspringe and 92-year-old anneliese bee is paying a visit to her daughter , granddaughter and great-granddaughter .
four generations in one room is uncommon , bee knows .
“ as old as i am - and still able to get around - that 's a rarity , ” said bee , who lives in her own apartment and regularly cooks lunch for her family .
“ my mother died at 68 , my father-in-law at 70 and my mother-in-law at 68 , ” said bee .
but as bee has grown older , the life expectancy of those living in industrialized lands has also increased .
it 's not as unusual as it once was to see people living to 80 or 90 .
“ over the last several years , we 've seen the average life expectancy continuously increase , ” said bettina sommer of the federal statistics office in wiesbaden .
“ if we go back to 130 years ago , we see the average life expectancy of a newborn has nearly doubled . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centenarian rosa richter received government congratulations on her 100th sommer , who heads a working group dealing specifically with life expectancy averages , says that a female born in germany today can anticipate seeing the ripe old age of 82 .
male newborns can expect to reach 76 on average .
the questionable value of statistics of course , these values are purely hypothetical - a palm reading of what 's possible in the future , if you will .
it remains impossible to predict on an individual basis just how long a person might live .
“ naturally , not all people who lived 130 years ago died at the age of 38 , ” said sommer .
“ many people died young , but there 's a good chance that others lived to be more than 60 or 70 years old . ”
the statistics likewise need to be adjusted according to infant mortality rates .
a high early death rate can decrease life expectancy tremendously .
one statistical possibility considers the notion that while two of four people live to be 80 years old , the other two die at birth .
that model makes for an average age of 40 .
at the same time , if we consider a group of four people in which only one person dies at birth and the other three reach the age of 80 , the life expectancy has suddenly jumped to 60 .
some countries moving in the opposite direction sinking infant mortality rates , then , have a lot to do with increasing life expectancy .
and in many countries , those rates have gone down thanks to medical advancements .
threats to infants and young children have substantially decreased due to the development of vaccines and antibiotics .
“ that 's definitely contributed to the sharp increase in life expectancy , ” said sommer .
“ and over the last century , the lifespan of older people has also increased . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children born in southern africa have greater problems aging at least that 's true for germany , which ranks among the countries with the longest average life .
unfortunately , that life increase has n't reached everywhere in the world , said sommer .
“ while these advancements over the last century have been felt across the world , there are likewise countries which are moving in the opposite direction . ”
in lands where aids is rampant , where many young people lose their lives in that battle , the life expectancy is sinking .
in southern african nations , the average lifespan is under 40 years .
the trend troubles many and aid agencies are working hard against the aids epidemic while also struggling to bring down infant mortality rates .
your chances of growing older increase with age while it may sound like common sense , the common belief now is that for every year you 've lived through , you 've increased your life expectancy .
the older a person grows , the better his or her chances are to become even older .
a 20-year-old can expect a higher lifespan than a newborn child because the 20-year-old has lived through the dangers of childhood and adolescence .
“ whoever is 80 today has a good chance of turning 81 tomorrow .
but a newborn first has to reach the age of 80 , ” said sommer .
that 's proven no problem for the spry and spirited 92-year-old anneliese bee .

whereas once life expectancy hovered around 35 , now that number ’ s closer to 80 .
but will we all live to 100 ? it 's friday afternoon in the small town of bad lippspringe and 92-year-old anneliese bee is paying a visit to her daughter , granddaughter and great-granddaughter .
four generations in one room is uncommon , bee knows .
“ as old as i am - and still able to get around - that 's a rarity , ” said bee , who lives in her own apartment and regularly cooks lunch for her family .
“ my mother died at 68 , my father-in-law at 70 and my mother-in-law at 68 , ” said bee .
but as bee has grown older , the life expectancy of those living in industrialized lands has also increased .
it 's not as unusual as it once was to see people living to 80 or 90 .
“ over the last several years , we 've seen the average life expectancy continuously increase , ” said bettina sommer of the federal statistics office in wiesbaden .
“ if we go back to 130 years ago , we see the average life expectancy of a newborn has nearly doubled . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centenarian rosa richter received government congratulations on her 100th sommer , who heads a working group dealing specifically with life expectancy averages , says that a female born in germany today can anticipate seeing the ripe old age of 82 .
male newborns can expect to reach 76 on average .
the questionable value of statistics of course , these values are purely hypothetical - a palm reading of what 's possible in the future , if you will .
it remains impossible to predict on an individual basis just how long a person might live .
“ naturally , not all people who lived 130 years ago died at the age of 38 , ” said sommer .
“ many people died young , but there 's a good chance that others lived to be more than 60 or 70 years old . ”
the statistics likewise need to be adjusted according to infant mortality rates .
a high early death rate can decrease life expectancy tremendously .
one statistical possibility considers the notion that while two of four people live to be 80 years old , the other two die at birth .
that model makes for an average age of 40 .
at the same time , if we consider a group of four people in which only one person dies at birth and the other three reach the age of 80 , the life expectancy has suddenly jumped to 60 .
some countries moving in the opposite direction sinking infant mortality rates , then , have a lot to do with increasing life expectancy .
and in many countries , those rates have gone down thanks to medical advancements .
threats to infants and young children have substantially decreased due to the development of vaccines and antibiotics .
“ that 's definitely contributed to the sharp increase in life expectancy , ” said sommer .
“ and over the last century , the lifespan of older people has also increased . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children born in southern africa have greater problems aging at least that 's true for germany , which ranks among the countries with the longest average life .
unfortunately , that life increase has n't reached everywhere in the world , said sommer .
“ while these advancements over the last century have been felt across the world , there are likewise countries which are moving in the opposite direction . ”
in lands where aids is rampant , where many young people lose their lives in that battle , the life expectancy is sinking .
in southern african nations , the average lifespan is under 40 years .
the trend troubles many and aid agencies are working hard against the aids epidemic while also struggling to bring down infant mortality rates .
your chances of growing older increase with age while it may sound like common sense , the common belief now is that for every year you 've lived through , you 've increased your life expectancy .
the older a person grows , the better his or her chances are to become even older .
a 20-year-old can expect a higher lifespan than a newborn child because the 20-year-old has lived through the dangers of childhood and adolescence .
“ whoever is 80 today has a good chance of turning 81 tomorrow .
but a newborn first has to reach the age of 80 , ” said sommer .
that 's proven no problem for the spry and spirited 92-year-old anneliese bee .
but although she 's feeling mentally at her peak , her body has begun to show its age .
she 's grown hard of hearing , has osteoarthrosis and is a bit unsteady on her feet .

" the eu has exhausted its room for maneuver in agriculture and can not go any further .
so we will not be making any further concessions , " said anne-marie idrac , a french government minister in charge of foreign trade .
idrac was speaking on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of eu ministers , convened in brussels to prepare the groundwork for next week 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks where 30 nations will try to salvage a set of long-floundering trade liberalization negotiations .
those talks will address the so-called doha round , which seek to bring down global trade barriers .
the negotiations have been dragging on since the round was launched in the qatar capital in november 2001 , amid disputes over subsidies to farmers by the us and eu and tariffs on industrial goods imposed by the developing economies of asia and latin america .
the 27-member eu runs the risk of being divided , with its southern members focused primarily on the agricultural sector and its northern members more interested in the services and industrial sectors .
but idrac insisted on friday that ministers had agreed to be united in strength .
the minister also reaffirmed the member states ' backing for the eu 's chief negotiator , trade commissioner peter mandelson , in spite of the fact that her president , nicolas sarkozy , had openly criticized his anti-protectionist stance only a month ago .
eu trade chief warns of failure mandelson on thursday said that a failure to reach a deal in geneva would hamper economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says failure could hamper economic growth the commissioner also said the eu was willing to accept a compromise deal drafted by wto head pascal lamy on the gradual reduction of eu import tariffs on bananas from latin america .
the eu currently offers more favorable conditions to banana exporters from its former colonies in africa , the pacific and the caribbean -lrb- apc -rrb- .
idrac said the eu would have to " strike a balance " between the requests of latin american producers , the need to encourage economic growth in the poorer apc countries , and the interests of the eu 's own banana producers .
the minister also called for an effective " anti-concentration " clause to be included in the rounds .
the clause , which is designed to prevent developing countries from defending entire sectors of their economy , has been strongly criticized by india .
one german government minister said next week 's talks had a " 50 to 50 chance " of succeeding .
" there are still plenty of obstacles and risks , " said bernd pfaffenbach , a junior minister who acts as germany 's sherpa at group of eight meetings .
pfaffenbach said the eu was not prepared to obtain a deal " at any price . "

" i think they have gone way too far on agriculture , " irish trade minister john mcguinness told journalists .
" we are keenly interested in a deal ... however that deal has to be balanced . "
he also refused to rule out the possibility of ireland vetoing any trade deal that did not suit dublin , describing it as an " option . "

but idrac insisted on friday that ministers had agreed to be united in strength .
the minister also reaffirmed the member states ' backing for the eu 's chief negotiator , trade commissioner peter mandelson , in spite of the fact that her president , nicolas sarkozy , had openly criticized his anti-protectionist stance only a month ago .
eu trade chief warns of failure mandelson on thursday said that a failure to reach a deal in geneva would hamper economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says failure could hamper economic growth the commissioner also said the eu was willing to accept a compromise deal drafted by wto head pascal lamy on the gradual reduction of eu import tariffs on bananas from latin america .
the eu currently offers more favorable conditions to banana exporters from its former colonies in africa , the pacific and the caribbean -lrb- apc -rrb- .
idrac said the eu would have to " strike a balance " between the requests of latin american producers , the need to encourage economic growth in the poorer apc countries , and the interests of the eu 's own banana producers .
the minister also called for an effective " anti-concentration " clause to be included in the rounds .
the clause , which is designed to prevent developing countries from defending entire sectors of their economy , has been strongly criticized by india .
one german government minister said next week 's talks had a " 50 to 50 chance " of succeeding .
" there are still plenty of obstacles and risks , " said bernd pfaffenbach , a junior minister who acts as germany 's sherpa at group of eight meetings .

the presence of a senior us diplomat at the talks has promoted an atmopshere of cautious optimism . on behalf of the veto powers and germany , eu chief diplomat javier solana will meet iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili to talk about an offer of future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics once tehran halts its nuclear activities . the united states ' representative at the talks , undersecretary of state william burns , is the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
he will not take an active role in the talks , however . representatives from britain , france , germany , russia and chinawill also attend the meeting .
these and other countries are concerned iran could one day use its civilian nuclear program to build atom bombs , an allegation which tehran strongly denies . western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment .
iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out . rice admits to us policy shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns will make history but will not take an active role the sending of burns as a senior envoy to geneva to participate in the nuclear talks with iran 's top negotiator shows that the united states has shifted position on diplomacy with iran , secretary of state condoleezza rice said on friday . but she insisted that tehran must suspend its enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear materials for substantive talks with washington . " the united states does n't have any permanent enemies , " rice said in response to a reporter 's question on the unexpected move to send a diplomat to meet directly with jalili in geneva . " and we hope this signal we 're sending , that we fully support the track that iran could take for a better relationship with the international community , is one the united states stands fully behind . " " we have been very clear that any country can change course , " rice added .
" this decision to send undersecretary -lrb- william -rrb- burns is an affirmation of the policy that we have been pursuing with our european allies ... for some time now . " rice called the move " a strong signal to the entire world that we have been very serious about this diplomacy and we will remain very serious about this diplomacy . " rice pointed out that she had endorsed the proposal from the so-called p5 plus one - the united states , france , britain , china , russia and germany - on incentives to advance talks with iran on halting its nuclear program . conditions remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said that the us still has conditions for negotiations she called sending burns to geneva to meet with jalili and eu foreign policy chief javier solana the " book end " to that process . " but it should be very clear to everyone the united states has a condition for the beginning of negotiations with iran , and that condition remains the verifiable suspension of iran 's enrichment and reprocessing activities , " rice said . asked in an interview with cnn , excerpts of which were aired friday , whether sending burns to geneva was a major policy change , rice answered : " i acknowledge that what we 've done is to make a step that we think demonstrates to everyone our seriousness about this process . " but what has not changed is that the united states is determined to have negotiations only when iran has suspended its enrichment and reprocessing .
that 's when the united states can join . " asked if saturday 's meeting is a one-shot deal , rice replied , " this is . " one-shot deal " we have one chance to receive the iranian response .
i transmitted the proposal .
-lrb- burns -rrb- will receive the response , " she told cnn .
" he will listen , and if iran is ready to suspend , then the united states will be there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jalili was optimistic that the discussions would be positive in tehran , jalili on friday expressed optimism that weekend talks would be constructive , provided washington came with the right approach . " what is important for us is with what approach they come to the talks .
if it is with a constructive approach , and that they refrain from past mistakes , then for sure we will have constructive talks , " he was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency before leaving tehran for geneva . washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends uranium enrichment and insisted on wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate . nonetheless , it will be the first time that the united states , which severed relations with iran in 1980 after the islamic revolution , will be present in the negotiations aimed at persuading tehran to freeze uranium enrichment . russian , iranian presidents hopeful meanwhile , the presidents of iran and russia expressed hope for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis on the eve of the key talks . president mahmoud ahmadinejad and his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev held their first telephone talks late on friday , iranian state media and the kremlin said . " in the geneva negotiations ... we can examine ways to make decisions in different fields and help resolve the existing issues , " the website of iranian state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying . he also expressed satisfaction over the current state of ties between tehran and moscow , which has substantial economic interests in the islamic republic , state television said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev watches the middle east situation with interest the kremlin , meanwhile , quoted medvedev as urging iran " to cooperate fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to clarify questions remaining about the iranian nuclear program . " " the russian president reiterated his firm position on resolving the situation surrounding iran 's nuclear program only by political and diplomatic means , " it added . medvedev told ahmadinejad he hoped for a " substantive and constructive dialogue " in geneva on saturday , it said . russia is one of the six world powers that last month gave iran a proposal offering it full negotiations on a range of incentives if it suspends its sensitive uranium enrichment operations . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presence of a senior us diplomat at the talks has promoted an atmopshere of cautious optimism . on behalf of the veto powers and germany , eu chief diplomat javier solana will meet iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili to talk about an offer of future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics once tehran halts its nuclear activities . the united states ' representative at the talks , undersecretary of state william burns , is the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
he will not take an active role in the talks , however . representatives from britain , france , germany , russia and chinawill also attend the meeting .
these and other countries are concerned iran could one day use its civilian nuclear program to build atom bombs , an allegation which tehran strongly denies . western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment .
iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out . rice admits to us policy shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns will make history but will not take an active role the sending of burns as a senior envoy to geneva to participate in the nuclear talks with iran 's top negotiator shows that the united states has shifted position on diplomacy with iran , secretary of state condoleezza rice said on friday . but she insisted that tehran must suspend its enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear materials for substantive talks with washington . " the united states does n't have any permanent enemies , " rice said in response to a reporter 's question on the unexpected move to send a diplomat to meet directly with jalili in geneva . " and we hope this signal we 're sending , that we fully support the track that iran could take for a better relationship with the international community , is one the united states stands fully behind . " " we have been very clear that any country can change course , " rice added .
" this decision to send undersecretary -lrb- william -rrb- burns is an affirmation of the policy that we have been pursuing with our european allies ... for some time now .

the presence of a senior us diplomat at the talks has promoted an atmopshere of cautious optimism . on behalf of the veto powers and germany , eu chief diplomat javier solana will meet iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili to talk about an offer of future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics once tehran halts its nuclear activities . the united states ' representative at the talks , undersecretary of state william burns , is the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
he will not take an active role in the talks , however . representatives from britain , france , germany , russia and chinawill also attend the meeting .
these and other countries are concerned iran could one day use its civilian nuclear program to build atom bombs , an allegation which tehran strongly denies . western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment .
iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out . rice admits to us policy shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns will make history but will not take an active role the sending of burns as a senior envoy to geneva to participate in the nuclear talks with iran 's top negotiator shows that the united states has shifted position on diplomacy with iran , secretary of state condoleezza rice said on friday . but she insisted that tehran must suspend its enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear materials for substantive talks with washington . " the united states does n't have any permanent enemies , " rice said in response to a reporter 's question on the unexpected move to send a diplomat to meet directly with jalili in geneva . " and we hope this signal we 're sending , that we fully support the track that iran could take for a better relationship with the international community , is one the united states stands fully behind . " " we have been very clear that any country can change course , " rice added .
" this decision to send undersecretary -lrb- william -rrb- burns is an affirmation of the policy that we have been pursuing with our european allies ... for some time now . " rice called the move " a strong signal to the entire world that we have been very serious about this diplomacy and we will remain very serious about this diplomacy . " rice pointed out that she had endorsed the proposal from the so-called p5 plus one - the united states , france , britain , china , russia and germany - on incentives to advance talks with iran on halting its nuclear program . conditions remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said that the us still has conditions for negotiations she called sending burns to geneva to meet with jalili and eu foreign policy chief javier solana the " book end " to that process . " but it should be very clear to everyone the united states has a condition for the beginning of negotiations with iran , and that condition remains the verifiable suspension of iran 's enrichment and reprocessing activities , " rice said . asked in an interview with cnn , excerpts of which were aired friday , whether sending burns to geneva was a major policy change , rice answered : " i acknowledge that what we 've done is to make a step that we think demonstrates to everyone our seriousness about this process . " but what has not changed is that the united states is determined to have negotiations only when iran has suspended its enrichment and reprocessing .
that 's when the united states can join . " asked if saturday 's meeting is a one-shot deal , rice replied , " this is . " one-shot deal " we have one chance to receive the iranian response .
i transmitted the proposal .
-lrb- burns -rrb- will receive the response , " she told cnn .
" he will listen , and if iran is ready to suspend , then the united states will be there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jalili was optimistic that the discussions would be positive in tehran , jalili on friday expressed optimism that weekend talks would be constructive , provided washington came with the right approach . " what is important for us is with what approach they come to the talks .
if it is with a constructive approach , and that they refrain from past mistakes , then for sure we will have constructive talks , " he was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency before leaving tehran for geneva . washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends uranium enrichment and insisted on wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate . nonetheless , it will be the first time that the united states , which severed relations with iran in 1980 after the islamic revolution , will be present in the negotiations aimed at persuading tehran to freeze uranium enrichment . russian , iranian presidents hopeful meanwhile , the presidents of iran and russia expressed hope for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis on the eve of the key talks . president mahmoud ahmadinejad and his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev held their first telephone talks late on friday , iranian state media and the kremlin said . " in the geneva negotiations ... we can examine ways to make decisions in different fields and help resolve the existing issues , " the website of iranian state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying . he also expressed satisfaction over the current state of ties between tehran and moscow , which has substantial economic interests in the islamic republic , state television said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev watches the middle east situation with interest the kremlin , meanwhile , quoted medvedev as urging iran " to cooperate fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to clarify questions remaining about the iranian nuclear program . " " the russian president reiterated his firm position on resolving the situation surrounding iran 's nuclear program only by political and diplomatic means , " it added . medvedev told ahmadinejad he hoped for a " substantive and constructive dialogue " in geneva on saturday , it said . russia is one of the six world powers that last month gave iran a proposal offering it full negotiations on a range of incentives if it suspends its sensitive uranium enrichment operations . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

soccer clubs have received a stern warning from the ruling body fifa and the international olympic committee that they must release players for the beijing games . fifa and the ioc said that clubs who refuse to let players go to the august 8-24 olympics will have these players suspended from club matches for the period .
the rule applies to all under-23 players - unless they do n't want to play at the games .
the olympic tournament is an under-23 event with three older players allowed per team .
" the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " ioc president jacques rogge told dpa news agency during an interview in lausanne , switzerland .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .
they sent a letter a couple of days ago to remind them of that . "
fifa spokesman alain leiblang confirmed the letter to dpa news agency on friday , saying : " we have informed the clubs that they must release the under-23 players . "

and ac milan vice-president alberto galliano said that his club would have not let newly-hired ronaldinho go to beijing had he been at milan before the player 's transfer from barcelona this week .
" we respect the obligation that he took on before he came to milan .
if he had already been a rossonero , we would not have let him go , but as he is joining us later we will let him go to the olympics , " said galliano .

the clubs argue that the olympic tournament is not on the official fifa calendar -lrb- unlike the women 's event -rrb- and that it is therefore up to them to decide whether their men can play for gold or not .
rogge said he can understand the clubs but at the same time wants the football tournament to be as attractive as possible .

soccer clubs have received a stern warning from the ruling body fifa and the international olympic committee that they must release players for the beijing games . fifa and the ioc said that clubs who refuse to let players go to the august 8-24 olympics will have these players suspended from club matches for the period .
the rule applies to all under-23 players - unless they do n't want to play at the games .
the olympic tournament is an under-23 event with three older players allowed per team .
" the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " ioc president jacques rogge told dpa news agency during an interview in lausanne , switzerland .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .
they sent a letter a couple of days ago to remind them of that . "
fifa spokesman alain leiblang confirmed the letter to dpa news agency on friday , saying : " we have informed the clubs that they must release the under-23 players . "
german clubs keeping players at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's rafinha is one of the bundesliga stars staying put while brazil 's ronaldinho and lionel messi of argentina are among the stars to play in beijing , others like brazil 's diego and rafinha , or belgium 's vincent kompany are not to be released by their german clubs , werder bremen , schalke and sv hamburg , respectively .
and ac milan vice-president alberto galliano said that his club would have not let newly-hired ronaldinho go to beijing had he been at milan before the player 's transfer from barcelona this week .
" we respect the obligation that he took on before he came to milan .
if he had already been a rossonero , we would not have let him go , but as he is joining us later we will let him go to the olympics , " said galliano .
milan coach carlo ancelotti even saw the bright side of it , saying : " it is a chance for him to find his fitness .
when he comes back he will be ready .
he will only need to learn his place in our system . "
bremen stand firm on diego diego , by contrast , is not to be a fellow-midfielder for brazil as many clubs disagree with the views of fifa and the ioc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego is said to be very angry about his club 's decision " there is no such rule according to the statutes .
we have no written statement from fifa or the ioc that we have to release someone , " said bremen sports director klaus allofs .
the clubs argue that the olympic tournament is not on the official fifa calendar -lrb- unlike the women 's event -rrb- and that it is therefore up to them to decide whether their men can play for gold or not .
rogge said he can understand the clubs but at the same time wants the football tournament to be as attractive as possible .
" their clubs have other motives , the regular calendar , champions league qualifying and then they do n't want to send them .
they are afraid they could be injured , " rogge said .
" i am very happy that the big players want to participate in the games , ronaldinho wants to go to the games .
so there are a lot of great players who want to go .
the games are something special for them . "
rogge said he would prefer no age restrictions to have all top stars compete but that he respects the under-23 agreement signed between ifa and the ioc in 1993 .
" we are happy to have soccer for various reasons .
it is the most popular sport in the world , it is a success in the olympic games , they are number three in audience among the 28 sports and they are number one in the sale of tickets , " said rogge . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with dpa news agency in wolfsburg , he deflated predictions that millions of people would be driving electric cars by the middle of the 2010s as " very optimistic . "
leohold said volkswagen would sell electric models , but cautioned , " it will take 20 to 25 years before electric cars achieve a market share of more than 10 per cent . "
volkswagen 's first electric car would be a small car due out in 2010 , but bigger ones might follow .
" we have an ambition to electrify more than just the really small cars , but also our main model series , the golf , " he said .
leohold said research into lithium-ion batteries had made big jumps , but the items were still far too expensive .
he said electric motors would never replace internal-combustion engines in some sectors , such as long-distance heavy trucks .
" at the moment it is inconceivable they could ever be powered by batteries , " he said , adding that there was still major potential to make petrol and diesel engines more efficient .

they could also jointly develop gearless electric traction motors for cars , the magazine said .

schaeuble shut down german offices of danish-based roj tv earlier this year and declared it no longer had a licence to broadcast in germany , although its satellite signal can still be easily picked up by viewers inside germany .
the kurdish rebel group pkk this month kidnapped three german mountaineers on mount ararat in eastern turkey in anger at the move .
focus said the secret bka analysis suggested that " a personal risk to the minister is conceivable . "
focus said the bka had also advised the german foreign ministry to expand its current " urgent " warning against travel by germans to kurdish areas .
it urged the ministry to advise vacationers against visiting any part of turkey at all . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu has exhausted its room for maneuver in agriculture and can not go any further .
so we will not be making any further concessions , " said anne-marie idrac , a french government minister in charge of foreign trade .
idrac was speaking on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of eu ministers , convened in brussels to prepare the groundwork for next week 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks where 30 nations will try to salvage a set of long-floundering trade liberalization negotiations .
those talks will address the so-called doha round , which seek to bring down global trade barriers .
the negotiations have been dragging on since the round was launched in the qatar capital in november 2001 , amid disputes over subsidies to farmers by the us and eu and tariffs on industrial goods imposed by the developing economies of asia and latin america .
the 27-member eu runs the risk of being divided , with its southern members focused primarily on the agricultural sector and its northern members more interested in the services and industrial sectors .
but idrac insisted on friday that ministers had agreed to be united in strength .
the minister also reaffirmed the member states ' backing for the eu 's chief negotiator , trade commissioner peter mandelson , in spite of the fact that her president , nicolas sarkozy , had openly criticized his anti-protectionist stance only a month ago .
eu trade chief warns of failure mandelson on thursday said that a failure to reach a deal in geneva would hamper economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says failure could hamper economic growth the commissioner also said the eu was willing to accept a compromise deal drafted by wto head pascal lamy on the gradual reduction of eu import tariffs on bananas from latin america .
the eu currently offers more favorable conditions to banana exporters from its former colonies in africa , the pacific and the caribbean -lrb- apc -rrb- .
idrac said the eu would have to " strike a balance " between the requests of latin american producers , the need to encourage economic growth in the poorer apc countries , and the interests of the eu 's own banana producers .
the minister also called for an effective " anti-concentration " clause to be included in the rounds .
the clause , which is designed to prevent developing countries from defending entire sectors of their economy , has been strongly criticized by india .
one german government minister said next week 's talks had a " 50 to 50 chance " of succeeding .
" there are still plenty of obstacles and risks , " said bernd pfaffenbach , a junior minister who acts as germany 's sherpa at group of eight meetings .
pfaffenbach said the eu was not prepared to obtain a deal " at any price . "
ireland threatens veto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has been restrained on trade since taking on the presidency while france avoided controversy on agriculture , ireland - paris ' long-time ally on agriculture - accused the european commission of offering too much as europe 's negotiator within the wto while getting little in return .
" i think they have gone way too far on agriculture , " irish trade minister john mcguinness told journalists .
" we are keenly interested in a deal ... however that deal has to be balanced . "
he also refused to rule out the possibility of ireland vetoing any trade deal that did not suit dublin , describing it as an " option . "
accounting for 20 percent of global trade , the eu is a heavy hitter in the wto , where it has long been under pressure from emerging agriculture powers and the united states to ease its farm support . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says failure could hamper economic growth the commissioner also said the eu was willing to accept a compromise deal drafted by wto head pascal lamy on the gradual reduction of eu import tariffs on bananas from latin america .
the eu currently offers more favorable conditions to banana exporters from its former colonies in africa , the pacific and the caribbean -lrb- apc -rrb- .
idrac said the eu would have to " strike a balance " between the requests of latin american producers , the need to encourage economic growth in the poorer apc countries , and the interests of the eu 's own banana producers .
the minister also called for an effective " anti-concentration " clause to be included in the rounds .
the clause , which is designed to prevent developing countries from defending entire sectors of their economy , has been strongly criticized by india .
one german government minister said next week 's talks had a " 50 to 50 chance " of succeeding .
" there are still plenty of obstacles and risks , " said bernd pfaffenbach , a junior minister who acts as germany 's sherpa at group of eight meetings .
pfaffenbach said the eu was not prepared to obtain a deal " at any price . "

" i think they have gone way too far on agriculture , " irish trade minister john mcguinness told journalists .
" we are keenly interested in a deal ... however that deal has to be balanced . "
he also refused to rule out the possibility of ireland vetoing any trade deal that did not suit dublin , describing it as an " option . "

soccer clubs have received a stern warning from the ruling body fifa and the international olympic committee that they must release players for the beijing games . fifa and the ioc said that clubs who refuse to let players go to the august 8-24 olympics will have these players suspended from club matches for the period .
the rule applies to all under-23 players - unless they do n't want to play at the games .
the olympic tournament is an under-23 event with three older players allowed per team .
" the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " ioc president jacques rogge told dpa news agency during an interview in lausanne , switzerland .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .
they sent a letter a couple of days ago to remind them of that . "
fifa spokesman alain leiblang confirmed the letter to dpa news agency on friday , saying : " we have informed the clubs that they must release the under-23 players . "
german clubs keeping players at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's rafinha is one of the bundesliga stars staying put while brazil 's ronaldinho and lionel messi of argentina are among the stars to play in beijing , others like brazil 's diego and rafinha , or belgium 's vincent kompany are not to be released by their german clubs , werder bremen , schalke and sv hamburg , respectively .
and ac milan vice-president alberto galliano said that his club would have not let newly-hired ronaldinho go to beijing had he been at milan before the player 's transfer from barcelona this week .
" we respect the obligation that he took on before he came to milan .
if he had already been a rossonero , we would not have let him go , but as he is joining us later we will let him go to the olympics , " said galliano .
milan coach carlo ancelotti even saw the bright side of it , saying : " it is a chance for him to find his fitness .
when he comes back he will be ready .
he will only need to learn his place in our system . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego is said to be very angry about his club 's decision " there is no such rule according to the statutes .
we have no written statement from fifa or the ioc that we have to release someone , " said bremen sports director klaus allofs .
the clubs argue that the olympic tournament is not on the official fifa calendar -lrb- unlike the women 's event -rrb- and that it is therefore up to them to decide whether their men can play for gold or not .
rogge said he can understand the clubs but at the same time wants the football tournament to be as attractive as possible .
" their clubs have other motives , the regular calendar , champions league qualifying and then they do n't want to send them .
they are afraid they could be injured , " rogge said .
" i am very happy that the big players want to participate in the games , ronaldinho wants to go to the games .
so there are a lot of great players who want to go .
the games are something special for them . "
rogge said he would prefer no age restrictions to have all top stars compete but that he respects the under-23 agreement signed between ifa and the ioc in 1993 .
" we are happy to have soccer for various reasons .
it is the most popular sport in the world , it is a success in the olympic games , they are number three in audience among the 28 sports and they are number one in the sale of tickets , " said rogge . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am awaiting a concrete and detailed explanation from germany , " vladimir spidla told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily during a conference in bonn .
" germany must provide -lrb- an explanation -rrb- , then i will see if the arguments are convincing , " the former czech prime minister added .
earlier this week , the german government said it would ease rules for highly qualified immigrants from new eu states seeking work to fill yawning gaps in the german job market .
the government also reduced the minimum wage highly-skilled foreigners have to earn to secure a work permit to 63,600 euros -lrb- $ 101,200 -rrb- per year from 86,400 euros .
welcome mat for skilled workers like many industrialized nations , germany is struggling to fill thousands of vacant jobs requiring a high level of skills and expertise .
german business have long complained of a dearth of skilled workers in the country and the new measures are an effort to plug a shortage of skilled labour in sectors such as engineering and technology .

however , the proposals include keeping germany 's labor market closed to unskilled workers from new eu member states for two years longer than planned .
germany is one of a handful of eu states still restricting workers from nations that joined the bloc in 2004 .
unskilled workers from the 10 countries that joined the eu in may , 2004 , excluding cyprus and malta , will not be allowed in until april 2011 , compared with an original date of the end of april , 2009 .
cheap workers from romania and bulgaria will continue to be excluded until the end of 2011 .

the german unemployment rate has since fallen from the double-digit range to 7.5 percent in june .

soccer clubs have received a stern warning from the ruling body fifa and the international olympic committee that they must release players for the beijing games . fifa and the ioc said that clubs who refuse to let players go to the august 8-24 olympics will have these players suspended from club matches for the period .
the rule applies to all under-23 players - unless they do n't want to play at the games .
the olympic tournament is an under-23 event with three older players allowed per team .
" the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " ioc president jacques rogge told dpa news agency during an interview in lausanne , switzerland .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .
they sent a letter a couple of days ago to remind them of that . "
fifa spokesman alain leiblang confirmed the letter to dpa news agency on friday , saying : " we have informed the clubs that they must release the under-23 players . "
german clubs keeping players at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's rafinha is one of the bundesliga stars staying put while brazil 's ronaldinho and lionel messi of argentina are among the stars to play in beijing , others like brazil 's diego and rafinha , or belgium 's vincent kompany are not to be released by their german clubs , werder bremen , schalke and sv hamburg , respectively .
and ac milan vice-president alberto galliano said that his club would have not let newly-hired ronaldinho go to beijing had he been at milan before the player 's transfer from barcelona this week .
" we respect the obligation that he took on before he came to milan .
if he had already been a rossonero , we would not have let him go , but as he is joining us later we will let him go to the olympics , " said galliano .
milan coach carlo ancelotti even saw the bright side of it , saying : " it is a chance for him to find his fitness .
when he comes back he will be ready .
he will only need to learn his place in our system . "
bremen stand firm on diego diego , by contrast , is not to be a fellow-midfielder for brazil as many clubs disagree with the views of fifa and the ioc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego is said to be very angry about his club 's decision " there is no such rule according to the statutes .
we have no written statement from fifa or the ioc that we have to release someone , " said bremen sports director klaus allofs .
the clubs argue that the olympic tournament is not on the official fifa calendar -lrb- unlike the women 's event -rrb- and that it is therefore up to them to decide whether their men can play for gold or not .
rogge said he can understand the clubs but at the same time wants the football tournament to be as attractive as possible .
" their clubs have other motives , the regular calendar , champions league qualifying and then they do n't want to send them .
they are afraid they could be injured , " rogge said .
" i am very happy that the big players want to participate in the games , ronaldinho wants to go to the games .
so there are a lot of great players who want to go .
the games are something special for them . "
rogge said he would prefer no age restrictions to have all top stars compete but that he respects the under-23 agreement signed between ifa and the ioc in 1993 .
" we are happy to have soccer for various reasons .
it is the most popular sport in the world , it is a success in the olympic games , they are number three in audience among the 28 sports and they are number one in the sale of tickets , " said rogge . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than 1.2 million flocked to a roughly one-mile long main road which had been closed to allow the scantily dressed mostly young people to shake to techno music blasted from 37 floats .
some 250 djs are taking part in the event , which is expected to last until midnight saturday .
driven by electronic dance music , the spectacle has gained a reputation over the past two decades for loudness , outlandish garb , marathon dancing , and , by some accounts , widespread use of the drug ecstasy .
organizers said 15 of the bands came from abroad , including from australia , south korea , ukraine and turkey .
each band occupied a float .
the amplifiers required cooling to stop them overheating .

soccer clubs have received a stern warning from the ruling body fifa and the international olympic committee that they must release players for the beijing games . fifa and the ioc said that clubs who refuse to let players go to the august 8-24 olympics will have these players suspended from club matches for the period .
the rule applies to all under-23 players - unless they do n't want to play at the games .
the olympic tournament is an under-23 event with three older players allowed per team .
" the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " ioc president jacques rogge told dpa news agency during an interview in lausanne , switzerland .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .
they sent a letter a couple of days ago to remind them of that . "
fifa spokesman alain leiblang confirmed the letter to dpa news agency on friday , saying : " we have informed the clubs that they must release the under-23 players . "
german clubs keeping players at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's rafinha is one of the bundesliga stars staying put while brazil 's ronaldinho and lionel messi of argentina are among the stars to play in beijing , others like brazil 's diego and rafinha , or belgium 's vincent kompany are not to be released by their german clubs , werder bremen , schalke and sv hamburg , respectively .
and ac milan vice-president alberto galliano said that his club would have not let newly-hired ronaldinho go to beijing had he been at milan before the player 's transfer from barcelona this week .
" we respect the obligation that he took on before he came to milan .
if he had already been a rossonero , we would not have let him go , but as he is joining us later we will let him go to the olympics , " said galliano .
milan coach carlo ancelotti even saw the bright side of it , saying : " it is a chance for him to find his fitness .
when he comes back he will be ready .
he will only need to learn his place in our system . "
bremen stand firm on diego diego , by contrast , is not to be a fellow-midfielder for brazil as many clubs disagree with the views of fifa and the ioc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego is said to be very angry about his club 's decision " there is no such rule according to the statutes .
we have no written statement from fifa or the ioc that we have to release someone , " said bremen sports director klaus allofs .
the clubs argue that the olympic tournament is not on the official fifa calendar -lrb- unlike the women 's event -rrb- and that it is therefore up to them to decide whether their men can play for gold or not .
rogge said he can understand the clubs but at the same time wants the football tournament to be as attractive as possible .
" their clubs have other motives , the regular calendar , champions league qualifying and then they do n't want to send them .
they are afraid they could be injured , " rogge said .
" i am very happy that the big players want to participate in the games , ronaldinho wants to go to the games .
so there are a lot of great players who want to go .
the games are something special for them . "
rogge said he would prefer no age restrictions to have all top stars compete but that he respects the under-23 agreement signed between ifa and the ioc in 1993 .
" we are happy to have soccer for various reasons .
it is the most popular sport in the world , it is a success in the olympic games , they are number three in audience among the 28 sports and they are number one in the sale of tickets , " said rogge . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am awaiting a concrete and detailed explanation from germany , " vladimir spidla told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily during a conference in bonn .
" germany must provide -lrb- an explanation -rrb- , then i will see if the arguments are convincing , " the former czech prime minister added .
earlier this week , the german government said it would ease rules for highly qualified immigrants from new eu states seeking work to fill yawning gaps in the german job market .
the government also reduced the minimum wage highly-skilled foreigners have to earn to secure a work permit to 63,600 euros -lrb- $ 101,200 -rrb- per year from 86,400 euros .
welcome mat for skilled workers like many industrialized nations , germany is struggling to fill thousands of vacant jobs requiring a high level of skills and expertise .
german business have long complained of a dearth of skilled workers in the country and the new measures are an effort to plug a shortage of skilled labour in sectors such as engineering and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces a huge shortage of engineers the shortage of computer technicians , engineers and other skilled workers is costing europe 's largest economy around 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.8 billion -rrb- a year , according to estimates by the government and the dihk chambers of industry and commerce .
" we have taken a step toward making germany more competitive internationally , " social democrat labor minister olaf scholz said earlier this week .
" we are putting the conditions in place so that people can come here who can contribute to creating economic growth . "
raw deal for unskilled immigrants ?
however , the proposals include keeping germany 's labor market closed to unskilled workers from new eu member states for two years longer than planned .
germany is one of a handful of eu states still restricting workers from nations that joined the bloc in 2004 .
unskilled workers from the 10 countries that joined the eu in may , 2004 , excluding cyprus and malta , will not be allowed in until april 2011 , compared with an original date of the end of april , 2009 .
cheap workers from romania and bulgaria will continue to be excluded until the end of 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spidla wants germany to explain its bar on unskilled workers when the eu expanded to take in 10 new members in 2004 , berlin at the time cited fears that a flood of cheap labor would put germans out of work due to germany 's geographic proximity to the new member states .
the german unemployment rate has since fallen from the double-digit range to 7.5 percent in june .
spidla said that while eu states could maintain restrictions until 2011 , " each government must prove there are risks of serious disruption to its labor market .

" the eu has exhausted its room for maneuver in agriculture and can not go any further .
so we will not be making any further concessions , " said anne-marie idrac , a french government minister in charge of foreign trade .
idrac was speaking on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of eu ministers , convened in brussels to prepare the groundwork for next week 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks where 30 nations will try to salvage a set of long-floundering trade liberalization negotiations .
those talks will address the so-called doha round , which seek to bring down global trade barriers .
the negotiations have been dragging on since the round was launched in the qatar capital in november 2001 , amid disputes over subsidies to farmers by the us and eu and tariffs on industrial goods imposed by the developing economies of asia and latin america .
the 27-member eu runs the risk of being divided , with its southern members focused primarily on the agricultural sector and its northern members more interested in the services and industrial sectors .
but idrac insisted on friday that ministers had agreed to be united in strength .
the minister also reaffirmed the member states ' backing for the eu 's chief negotiator , trade commissioner peter mandelson , in spite of the fact that her president , nicolas sarkozy , had openly criticized his anti-protectionist stance only a month ago .
eu trade chief warns of failure mandelson on thursday said that a failure to reach a deal in geneva would hamper economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says failure could hamper economic growth the commissioner also said the eu was willing to accept a compromise deal drafted by wto head pascal lamy on the gradual reduction of eu import tariffs on bananas from latin america .
the eu currently offers more favorable conditions to banana exporters from its former colonies in africa , the pacific and the caribbean -lrb- apc -rrb- .
idrac said the eu would have to " strike a balance " between the requests of latin american producers , the need to encourage economic growth in the poorer apc countries , and the interests of the eu 's own banana producers .
the minister also called for an effective " anti-concentration " clause to be included in the rounds .
the clause , which is designed to prevent developing countries from defending entire sectors of their economy , has been strongly criticized by india .
one german government minister said next week 's talks had a " 50 to 50 chance " of succeeding .
" there are still plenty of obstacles and risks , " said bernd pfaffenbach , a junior minister who acts as germany 's sherpa at group of eight meetings .
pfaffenbach said the eu was not prepared to obtain a deal " at any price . "
ireland threatens veto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has been restrained on trade since taking on the presidency while france avoided controversy on agriculture , ireland - paris ' long-time ally on agriculture - accused the european commission of offering too much as europe 's negotiator within the wto while getting little in return .
" i think they have gone way too far on agriculture , " irish trade minister john mcguinness told journalists .
" we are keenly interested in a deal ... however that deal has to be balanced . "
he also refused to rule out the possibility of ireland vetoing any trade deal that did not suit dublin , describing it as an " option . "
accounting for 20 percent of global trade , the eu is a heavy hitter in the wto , where it has long been under pressure from emerging agriculture powers and the united states to ease its farm support . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

whereas once life expectancy hovered around 35 , now that number ’ s closer to 80 .
but will we all live to 100 ? it 's friday afternoon in the small town of bad lippspringe and 92-year-old anneliese bee is paying a visit to her daughter , granddaughter and great-granddaughter .
four generations in one room is uncommon , bee knows .
“ as old as i am - and still able to get around - that 's a rarity , ” said bee , who lives in her own apartment and regularly cooks lunch for her family .
“ my mother died at 68 , my father-in-law at 70 and my mother-in-law at 68 , ” said bee .
but as bee has grown older , the life expectancy of those living in industrialized lands has also increased .
it 's not as unusual as it once was to see people living to 80 or 90 .
“ over the last several years , we 've seen the average life expectancy continuously increase , ” said bettina sommer of the federal statistics office in wiesbaden .
“ if we go back to 130 years ago , we see the average life expectancy of a newborn has nearly doubled . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centenarian rosa richter received government congratulations on her 100th sommer , who heads a working group dealing specifically with life expectancy averages , says that a female born in germany today can anticipate seeing the ripe old age of 82 .
male newborns can expect to reach 76 on average .
the questionable value of statistics of course , these values are purely hypothetical - a palm reading of what 's possible in the future , if you will .
it remains impossible to predict on an individual basis just how long a person might live .
“ naturally , not all people who lived 130 years ago died at the age of 38 , ” said sommer .
“ many people died young , but there 's a good chance that others lived to be more than 60 or 70 years old . ”
the statistics likewise need to be adjusted according to infant mortality rates .
a high early death rate can decrease life expectancy tremendously .
one statistical possibility considers the notion that while two of four people live to be 80 years old , the other two die at birth .
that model makes for an average age of 40 .
at the same time , if we consider a group of four people in which only one person dies at birth and the other three reach the age of 80 , the life expectancy has suddenly jumped to 60 .
some countries moving in the opposite direction sinking infant mortality rates , then , have a lot to do with increasing life expectancy .
and in many countries , those rates have gone down thanks to medical advancements .
threats to infants and young children have substantially decreased due to the development of vaccines and antibiotics .
“ that 's definitely contributed to the sharp increase in life expectancy , ” said sommer .
“ and over the last century , the lifespan of older people has also increased . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children born in southern africa have greater problems aging at least that 's true for germany , which ranks among the countries with the longest average life .
unfortunately , that life increase has n't reached everywhere in the world , said sommer .
“ while these advancements over the last century have been felt across the world , there are likewise countries which are moving in the opposite direction . ”
in lands where aids is rampant , where many young people lose their lives in that battle , the life expectancy is sinking .
in southern african nations , the average lifespan is under 40 years .
the trend troubles many and aid agencies are working hard against the aids epidemic while also struggling to bring down infant mortality rates .
your chances of growing older increase with age while it may sound like common sense , the common belief now is that for every year you 've lived through , you 've increased your life expectancy .
the older a person grows , the better his or her chances are to become even older .
a 20-year-old can expect a higher lifespan than a newborn child because the 20-year-old has lived through the dangers of childhood and adolescence .
“ whoever is 80 today has a good chance of turning 81 tomorrow .
but a newborn first has to reach the age of 80 , ” said sommer .
that 's proven no problem for the spry and spirited 92-year-old anneliese bee .
but although she 's feeling mentally at her peak , her body has begun to show its age .
she 's grown hard of hearing , has osteoarthrosis and is a bit unsteady on her feet .
a year ago , she fell off her bike .

whereas once life expectancy hovered around 35 , now that number ’ s closer to 80 .
but will we all live to 100 ? it 's friday afternoon in the small town of bad lippspringe and 92-year-old anneliese bee is paying a visit to her daughter , granddaughter and great-granddaughter .
four generations in one room is uncommon , bee knows .
“ as old as i am - and still able to get around - that 's a rarity , ” said bee , who lives in her own apartment and regularly cooks lunch for her family .
“ my mother died at 68 , my father-in-law at 70 and my mother-in-law at 68 , ” said bee .
but as bee has grown older , the life expectancy of those living in industrialized lands has also increased .
it 's not as unusual as it once was to see people living to 80 or 90 .
“ over the last several years , we 've seen the average life expectancy continuously increase , ” said bettina sommer of the federal statistics office in wiesbaden .
“ if we go back to 130 years ago , we see the average life expectancy of a newborn has nearly doubled . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centenarian rosa richter received government congratulations on her 100th sommer , who heads a working group dealing specifically with life expectancy averages , says that a female born in germany today can anticipate seeing the ripe old age of 82 .
male newborns can expect to reach 76 on average .
the questionable value of statistics of course , these values are purely hypothetical - a palm reading of what 's possible in the future , if you will .
it remains impossible to predict on an individual basis just how long a person might live .
“ naturally , not all people who lived 130 years ago died at the age of 38 , ” said sommer .
“ many people died young , but there 's a good chance that others lived to be more than 60 or 70 years old . ”
the statistics likewise need to be adjusted according to infant mortality rates .
a high early death rate can decrease life expectancy tremendously .
one statistical possibility considers the notion that while two of four people live to be 80 years old , the other two die at birth .
that model makes for an average age of 40 .
at the same time , if we consider a group of four people in which only one person dies at birth and the other three reach the age of 80 , the life expectancy has suddenly jumped to 60 .
some countries moving in the opposite direction sinking infant mortality rates , then , have a lot to do with increasing life expectancy .
and in many countries , those rates have gone down thanks to medical advancements .
threats to infants and young children have substantially decreased due to the development of vaccines and antibiotics .
“ that 's definitely contributed to the sharp increase in life expectancy , ” said sommer .
“ and over the last century , the lifespan of older people has also increased . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children born in southern africa have greater problems aging at least that 's true for germany , which ranks among the countries with the longest average life .
unfortunately , that life increase has n't reached everywhere in the world , said sommer .
“ while these advancements over the last century have been felt across the world , there are likewise countries which are moving in the opposite direction . ”
in lands where aids is rampant , where many young people lose their lives in that battle , the life expectancy is sinking .
in southern african nations , the average lifespan is under 40 years .
the trend troubles many and aid agencies are working hard against the aids epidemic while also struggling to bring down infant mortality rates .
your chances of growing older increase with age while it may sound like common sense , the common belief now is that for every year you 've lived through , you 've increased your life expectancy .
the older a person grows , the better his or her chances are to become even older .
a 20-year-old can expect a higher lifespan than a newborn child because the 20-year-old has lived through the dangers of childhood and adolescence .
“ whoever is 80 today has a good chance of turning 81 tomorrow .
but a newborn first has to reach the age of 80 , ” said sommer .
that 's proven no problem for the spry and spirited 92-year-old anneliese bee .
but although she 's feeling mentally at her peak , her body has begun to show its age .
she 's grown hard of hearing , has osteoarthrosis and is a bit unsteady on her feet .
a year ago , she fell off her bike .

but not all were ready to accept the apology .
lobby groups for victims demanded more cash compensation and life-long care .
the 81-year-old pontiff acknowledged " the shame which we have all felt as a result of the sexual abuse of minors by some clergy and religious in this country . "
speaking at a mass with senior clergy at the cathedral where he is staying for a catholic youth festival , benedict said he was " deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have endured , and i assure them that , as their pastor , i , too , share in their suffering . "
" these misdeeds , which constitute so grave a betrayal of trust , deserve unequivocal condemnation .
they have caused great pain .
they have damaged the church 's witness , " the pope said .
the pope is in sydney for week-long world youth day celebrations , which conclude sunday with a papal mass at a city racecourse .
" in these days marked by the celebration of world youth day , we are reminded of how precious a treasure has been entrusted to us in our young people , and how great a part of the church 's mission in this country has been dedicated to their education and care , " the german-born pope said .
pope 's apology dismissed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's visit has brought out many protestors helen last , spokeswoman for lobby group in good faith and associates dismissed the pope 's apology as inadequate .
" it 's just a drop in a bucket - a bucket full of tears that all of us who work with victims have been sitting with for 25 to 30 years in australia , " last told australian news agency aap .
" would he like to roll his sleeves up and come to my office and be here ... everyday on the phone and meeting with these people and their families and doing all the trauma work ?
that 's what we need to see , those kinds of really practical social justice actions , " she added .
last week , cardinal george pell , leader of australia 's 5 million catholics , reiterated his apology to a couple blighted by a sexual abuse case in melbourne dating back to the 1980s .
the couple have demanded a meeting with the pope .
pell described as " tragic " the case of emma foster , who committed suicide earlier this year at the age of 26 .
her sister , katherine , who was also raped by melbourne priest kevin o 'donnell when she was a primary school pupil , was an alcoholic when she was rendered disabled by a drunk driver in 1999 .
" i apologized to emma in 1998 , " cardinal pell said .
" i met with her parents .
we offered them some financial help .
we also offered them counseling .
emma availed herself of that counseling for 10 years , and we contributed substantially towards those counseling costs . "
o 'connell died about 10 years ago in prison .
bishop urges church to move on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some catholic priests want to drop the sex abuse cases more pressure was placed on the pope to formally apologize to victims while in sydney when bishop anthony fisher , among the chief organizers of world youth day , criticized those " dwelling crankily " on past cases of sexual abuse by clergy .
" i think most of australia was enjoying , delighting in the beauty and goodness of these young people ... rather than dwelling crankily , as a few people are doing , on old wounds , " he said .
anthony foster , father of the two girls , told australia 's aap news agency that the papal apology was disappointing .
" they 're only words , the same thing we 've been hearing for 13 years , " he said .
" it 's simply an apology .
there 's nothing practical there , which is what we were looking for . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking at a mass with senior clergy at the cathedral where he is staying for a catholic youth festival , benedict said he was " deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have endured , and i assure them that , as their pastor , i , too , share in their suffering . "
" these misdeeds , which constitute so grave a betrayal of trust , deserve unequivocal condemnation .
they have caused great pain .
they have damaged the church 's witness , " the pope said .

" i am awaiting a concrete and detailed explanation from germany , " vladimir spidla told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily during a conference in bonn .
" germany must provide -lrb- an explanation -rrb- , then i will see if the arguments are convincing , " the former czech prime minister added .
earlier this week , the german government said it would ease rules for highly qualified immigrants from new eu states seeking work to fill yawning gaps in the german job market .
the government also reduced the minimum wage highly-skilled foreigners have to earn to secure a work permit to 63,600 euros -lrb- $ 101,200 -rrb- per year from 86,400 euros .

raw deal for unskilled immigrants ?
however , the proposals include keeping germany 's labor market closed to unskilled workers from new eu member states for two years longer than planned .
germany is one of a handful of eu states still restricting workers from nations that joined the bloc in 2004 .
unskilled workers from the 10 countries that joined the eu in may , 2004 , excluding cyprus and malta , will not be allowed in until april 2011 , compared with an original date of the end of april , 2009 .
cheap workers from romania and bulgaria will continue to be excluded until the end of 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spidla wants germany to explain its bar on unskilled workers when the eu expanded to take in 10 new members in 2004 , berlin at the time cited fears that a flood of cheap labor would put germans out of work due to germany 's geographic proximity to the new member states .
the german unemployment rate has since fallen from the double-digit range to 7.5 percent in june .
spidla said that while eu states could maintain restrictions until 2011 , " each government must prove there are risks of serious disruption to its labor market .

soccer clubs have received a stern warning from the ruling body fifa and the international olympic committee that they must release players for the beijing games . fifa and the ioc said that clubs who refuse to let players go to the august 8-24 olympics will have these players suspended from club matches for the period .
the rule applies to all under-23 players - unless they do n't want to play at the games .
the olympic tournament is an under-23 event with three older players allowed per team .
" the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " ioc president jacques rogge told dpa news agency during an interview in lausanne , switzerland .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .
they sent a letter a couple of days ago to remind them of that . "
fifa spokesman alain leiblang confirmed the letter to dpa news agency on friday , saying : " we have informed the clubs that they must release the under-23 players . "
german clubs keeping players at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's rafinha is one of the bundesliga stars staying put while brazil 's ronaldinho and lionel messi of argentina are among the stars to play in beijing , others like brazil 's diego and rafinha , or belgium 's vincent kompany are not to be released by their german clubs , werder bremen , schalke and sv hamburg , respectively .
and ac milan vice-president alberto galliano said that his club would have not let newly-hired ronaldinho go to beijing had he been at milan before the player 's transfer from barcelona this week .
" we respect the obligation that he took on before he came to milan .
if he had already been a rossonero , we would not have let him go , but as he is joining us later we will let him go to the olympics , " said galliano .
milan coach carlo ancelotti even saw the bright side of it , saying : " it is a chance for him to find his fitness .
when he comes back he will be ready .
he will only need to learn his place in our system . "
bremen stand firm on diego diego , by contrast , is not to be a fellow-midfielder for brazil as many clubs disagree with the views of fifa and the ioc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego is said to be very angry about his club 's decision " there is no such rule according to the statutes .
we have no written statement from fifa or the ioc that we have to release someone , " said bremen sports director klaus allofs .
the clubs argue that the olympic tournament is not on the official fifa calendar -lrb- unlike the women 's event -rrb- and that it is therefore up to them to decide whether their men can play for gold or not .
rogge said he can understand the clubs but at the same time wants the football tournament to be as attractive as possible .
" their clubs have other motives , the regular calendar , champions league qualifying and then they do n't want to send them .
they are afraid they could be injured , " rogge said .
" i am very happy that the big players want to participate in the games , ronaldinho wants to go to the games .
so there are a lot of great players who want to go .
the games are something special for them . "
rogge said he would prefer no age restrictions to have all top stars compete but that he respects the under-23 agreement signed between ifa and the ioc in 1993 .
" we are happy to have soccer for various reasons .
it is the most popular sport in the world , it is a success in the olympic games , they are number three in audience among the 28 sports and they are number one in the sale of tickets , " said rogge . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presence of a senior us diplomat at the talks has promoted an atmopshere of cautious optimism . on behalf of the veto powers and germany , eu chief diplomat javier solana will meet iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili to talk about an offer of future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics once tehran halts its nuclear activities . the united states ' representative at the talks , undersecretary of state william burns , is the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
he will not take an active role in the talks , however . representatives from britain , france , germany , russia and chinawill also attend the meeting .
these and other countries are concerned iran could one day use its civilian nuclear program to build atom bombs , an allegation which tehran strongly denies . western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment .

the presence of a senior us diplomat at the talks has promoted an atmopshere of cautious optimism . on behalf of the veto powers and germany , eu chief diplomat javier solana will meet iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili to talk about an offer of future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics once tehran halts its nuclear activities . the united states ' representative at the talks , undersecretary of state william burns , is the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
he will not take an active role in the talks , however . representatives from britain , france , germany , russia and chinawill also attend the meeting .
these and other countries are concerned iran could one day use its civilian nuclear program to build atom bombs , an allegation which tehran strongly denies . western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment .
iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out . rice admits to us policy shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns will make history but will not take an active role the sending of burns as a senior envoy to geneva to participate in the nuclear talks with iran 's top negotiator shows that the united states has shifted position on diplomacy with iran , secretary of state condoleezza rice said on friday . but she insisted that tehran must suspend its enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear materials for substantive talks with washington . " the united states does n't have any permanent enemies , " rice said in response to a reporter 's question on the unexpected move to send a diplomat to meet directly with jalili in geneva . " and we hope this signal we 're sending , that we fully support the track that iran could take for a better relationship with the international community , is one the united states stands fully behind . " " we have been very clear that any country can change course , " rice added .
" this decision to send undersecretary -lrb- william -rrb- burns is an affirmation of the policy that we have been pursuing with our european allies ... for some time now . " rice called the move " a strong signal to the entire world that we have been very serious about this diplomacy and we will remain very serious about this diplomacy .

" the eu has exhausted its room for maneuver in agriculture and can not go any further .
so we will not be making any further concessions , " said anne-marie idrac , a french government minister in charge of foreign trade .
idrac was speaking on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of eu ministers , convened in brussels to prepare the groundwork for next week 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks where 30 nations will try to salvage a set of long-floundering trade liberalization negotiations .
those talks will address the so-called doha round , which seek to bring down global trade barriers .
the negotiations have been dragging on since the round was launched in the qatar capital in november 2001 , amid disputes over subsidies to farmers by the us and eu and tariffs on industrial goods imposed by the developing economies of asia and latin america .
the 27-member eu runs the risk of being divided , with its southern members focused primarily on the agricultural sector and its northern members more interested in the services and industrial sectors .
but idrac insisted on friday that ministers had agreed to be united in strength .
the minister also reaffirmed the member states ' backing for the eu 's chief negotiator , trade commissioner peter mandelson , in spite of the fact that her president , nicolas sarkozy , had openly criticized his anti-protectionist stance only a month ago .
eu trade chief warns of failure mandelson on thursday said that a failure to reach a deal in geneva would hamper economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says failure could hamper economic growth the commissioner also said the eu was willing to accept a compromise deal drafted by wto head pascal lamy on the gradual reduction of eu import tariffs on bananas from latin america .
the eu currently offers more favorable conditions to banana exporters from its former colonies in africa , the pacific and the caribbean -lrb- apc -rrb- .
idrac said the eu would have to " strike a balance " between the requests of latin american producers , the need to encourage economic growth in the poorer apc countries , and the interests of the eu 's own banana producers .
the minister also called for an effective " anti-concentration " clause to be included in the rounds .
the clause , which is designed to prevent developing countries from defending entire sectors of their economy , has been strongly criticized by india .
one german government minister said next week 's talks had a " 50 to 50 chance " of succeeding .
" there are still plenty of obstacles and risks , " said bernd pfaffenbach , a junior minister who acts as germany 's sherpa at group of eight meetings .
pfaffenbach said the eu was not prepared to obtain a deal " at any price . "
ireland threatens veto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has been restrained on trade since taking on the presidency while france avoided controversy on agriculture , ireland - paris ' long-time ally on agriculture - accused the european commission of offering too much as europe 's negotiator within the wto while getting little in return .
" i think they have gone way too far on agriculture , " irish trade minister john mcguinness told journalists .
" we are keenly interested in a deal ... however that deal has to be balanced . "
he also refused to rule out the possibility of ireland vetoing any trade deal that did not suit dublin , describing it as an " option . "
accounting for 20 percent of global trade , the eu is a heavy hitter in the wto , where it has long been under pressure from emerging agriculture powers and the united states to ease its farm support . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu has exhausted its room for maneuver in agriculture and can not go any further .
so we will not be making any further concessions , " said anne-marie idrac , a french government minister in charge of foreign trade .
idrac was speaking on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of eu ministers , convened in brussels to prepare the groundwork for next week 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks where 30 nations will try to salvage a set of long-floundering trade liberalization negotiations .
those talks will address the so-called doha round , which seek to bring down global trade barriers .
the negotiations have been dragging on since the round was launched in the qatar capital in november 2001 , amid disputes over subsidies to farmers by the us and eu and tariffs on industrial goods imposed by the developing economies of asia and latin america .
the 27-member eu runs the risk of being divided , with its southern members focused primarily on the agricultural sector and its northern members more interested in the services and industrial sectors .
but idrac insisted on friday that ministers had agreed to be united in strength .
the minister also reaffirmed the member states ' backing for the eu 's chief negotiator , trade commissioner peter mandelson , in spite of the fact that her president , nicolas sarkozy , had openly criticized his anti-protectionist stance only a month ago .
eu trade chief warns of failure mandelson on thursday said that a failure to reach a deal in geneva would hamper economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says failure could hamper economic growth the commissioner also said the eu was willing to accept a compromise deal drafted by wto head pascal lamy on the gradual reduction of eu import tariffs on bananas from latin america .
the eu currently offers more favorable conditions to banana exporters from its former colonies in africa , the pacific and the caribbean -lrb- apc -rrb- .
idrac said the eu would have to " strike a balance " between the requests of latin american producers , the need to encourage economic growth in the poorer apc countries , and the interests of the eu 's own banana producers .
the minister also called for an effective " anti-concentration " clause to be included in the rounds .
the clause , which is designed to prevent developing countries from defending entire sectors of their economy , has been strongly criticized by india .
one german government minister said next week 's talks had a " 50 to 50 chance " of succeeding .
" there are still plenty of obstacles and risks , " said bernd pfaffenbach , a junior minister who acts as germany 's sherpa at group of eight meetings .
pfaffenbach said the eu was not prepared to obtain a deal " at any price . "
ireland threatens veto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has been restrained on trade since taking on the presidency while france avoided controversy on agriculture , ireland - paris ' long-time ally on agriculture - accused the european commission of offering too much as europe 's negotiator within the wto while getting little in return .
" i think they have gone way too far on agriculture , " irish trade minister john mcguinness told journalists .
" we are keenly interested in a deal ... however that deal has to be balanced . "
he also refused to rule out the possibility of ireland vetoing any trade deal that did not suit dublin , describing it as an " option . "
accounting for 20 percent of global trade , the eu is a heavy hitter in the wto , where it has long been under pressure from emerging agriculture powers and the united states to ease its farm support . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than 1.2 million flocked to a roughly one-mile long main road which had been closed to allow the scantily dressed mostly young people to shake to techno music blasted from 37 floats .
some 250 djs are taking part in the event , which is expected to last until midnight saturday .
driven by electronic dance music , the spectacle has gained a reputation over the past two decades for loudness , outlandish garb , marathon dancing , and , by some accounts , widespread use of the drug ecstasy .
organizers said 15 of the bands came from abroad , including from australia , south korea , ukraine and turkey .
each band occupied a float .
the amplifiers required cooling to stop them overheating .

" we made new friends who let us sleep -lrb- with 10 others -rrb- in a two-bed room at a bed-and-breakfast hotel .
real nice people , " he said .
highway to love the parade was being held in the west of germany for a second year after leaving berlin , where the annual spectacle began in 1989 .
organizers predicted a turnout of 1.2 million at the event on a section of national highway which was closed to traffic by city authorities and gave this year 's parade its motto , " highway to love . "
dj westbam , first up of 250 disc jockeys mixing the music , opened the event with his new highway to love " hymn . "
promoters said the parade could be seen live by satellite broadcast in 53 nations of the world .

the presence of a senior us diplomat at the talks has promoted an atmopshere of cautious optimism . on behalf of the veto powers and germany , eu chief diplomat javier solana will meet iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili to talk about an offer of future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics once tehran halts its nuclear activities . the united states ' representative at the talks , undersecretary of state william burns , is the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
he will not take an active role in the talks , however . representatives from britain , france , germany , russia and chinawill also attend the meeting .
these and other countries are concerned iran could one day use its civilian nuclear program to build atom bombs , an allegation which tehran strongly denies . western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment .
iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out . rice admits to us policy shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns will make history but will not take an active role the sending of burns as a senior envoy to geneva to participate in the nuclear talks with iran 's top negotiator shows that the united states has shifted position on diplomacy with iran , secretary of state condoleezza rice said on friday . but she insisted that tehran must suspend its enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear materials for substantive talks with washington .

" rice called the move " a strong signal to the entire world that we have been very serious about this diplomacy and we will remain very serious about this diplomacy .

the presence of a senior us diplomat at the talks has promoted an atmopshere of cautious optimism . on behalf of the veto powers and germany , eu chief diplomat javier solana will meet iranian nuclear negotiator saeid jalili to talk about an offer of future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics once tehran halts its nuclear activities . the united states ' representative at the talks , undersecretary of state william burns , is the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
he will not take an active role in the talks , however . representatives from britain , france , germany , russia and chinawill also attend the meeting .
these and other countries are concerned iran could one day use its civilian nuclear program to build atom bombs , an allegation which tehran strongly denies . western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment .
iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out . rice admits to us policy shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns will make history but will not take an active role the sending of burns as a senior envoy to geneva to participate in the nuclear talks with iran 's top negotiator shows that the united states has shifted position on diplomacy with iran , secretary of state condoleezza rice said on friday . but she insisted that tehran must suspend its enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear materials for substantive talks with washington . " the united states does n't have any permanent enemies , " rice said in response to a reporter 's question on the unexpected move to send a diplomat to meet directly with jalili in geneva . " and we hope this signal we 're sending , that we fully support the track that iran could take for a better relationship with the international community , is one the united states stands fully behind . " " we have been very clear that any country can change course , " rice added .
" this decision to send undersecretary -lrb- william -rrb- burns is an affirmation of the policy that we have been pursuing with our european allies ... for some time now . " rice called the move " a strong signal to the entire world that we have been very serious about this diplomacy and we will remain very serious about this diplomacy . " rice pointed out that she had endorsed the proposal from the so-called p5 plus one - the united states , france , britain , china , russia and germany - on incentives to advance talks with iran on halting its nuclear program . conditions remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said that the us still has conditions for negotiations she called sending burns to geneva to meet with jalili and eu foreign policy chief javier solana the " book end " to that process . " but it should be very clear to everyone the united states has a condition for the beginning of negotiations with iran , and that condition remains the verifiable suspension of iran 's enrichment and reprocessing activities , " rice said . asked in an interview with cnn , excerpts of which were aired friday , whether sending burns to geneva was a major policy change , rice answered : " i acknowledge that what we 've done is to make a step that we think demonstrates to everyone our seriousness about this process . " but what has not changed is that the united states is determined to have negotiations only when iran has suspended its enrichment and reprocessing .
that 's when the united states can join . " asked if saturday 's meeting is a one-shot deal , rice replied , " this is . " one-shot deal " we have one chance to receive the iranian response .
i transmitted the proposal .
-lrb- burns -rrb- will receive the response , " she told cnn .
" he will listen , and if iran is ready to suspend , then the united states will be there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jalili was optimistic that the discussions would be positive in tehran , jalili on friday expressed optimism that weekend talks would be constructive , provided washington came with the right approach . " what is important for us is with what approach they come to the talks .
if it is with a constructive approach , and that they refrain from past mistakes , then for sure we will have constructive talks , " he was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency before leaving tehran for geneva . washington has long said it will not negotiate with iran until it first suspends uranium enrichment and insisted on wednesday that burns was traveling to geneva to listen to iran 's response and not negotiate . nonetheless , it will be the first time that the united states , which severed relations with iran in 1980 after the islamic revolution , will be present in the negotiations aimed at persuading tehran to freeze uranium enrichment . russian , iranian presidents hopeful meanwhile , the presidents of iran and russia expressed hope for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis on the eve of the key talks . president mahmoud ahmadinejad and his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev held their first telephone talks late on friday , iranian state media and the kremlin said . " in the geneva negotiations ... we can examine ways to make decisions in different fields and help resolve the existing issues , " the website of iranian state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying . he also expressed satisfaction over the current state of ties between tehran and moscow , which has substantial economic interests in the islamic republic , state television said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev watches the middle east situation with interest the kremlin , meanwhile , quoted medvedev as urging iran " to cooperate fully with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to clarify questions remaining about the iranian nuclear program . " " the russian president reiterated his firm position on resolving the situation surrounding iran 's nuclear program only by political and diplomatic means , " it added . medvedev told ahmadinejad he hoped for a " substantive and constructive dialogue " in geneva on saturday , it said . russia is one of the six world powers that last month gave iran a proposal offering it full negotiations on a range of incentives if it suspends its sensitive uranium enrichment operations . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rule applies to all under-23 players - unless they do n't want to play at the games .
the olympic tournament is an under-23 event with three older players allowed per team .
" the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " ioc president jacques rogge told dpa news agency during an interview in lausanne , switzerland .
" fifa has reminded the clubs of this law .
they sent a letter a couple of days ago to remind them of that . "
fifa spokesman alain leiblang confirmed the letter to dpa news agency on friday , saying : " we have informed the clubs that they must release the under-23 players . "

soccer clubs have received a stern warning from the ruling body fifa and the international olympic committee that they must release players for the beijing games . fifa and the ioc said that clubs who refuse to let players go to the august 8-24 olympics will have these players suspended from club matches for the period .
the rule applies to all under-23 players - unless they do n't want to play at the games .
the olympic tournament is an under-23 event with three older players allowed per team .
" the law says that if a club does n't release a player then the player will be suspended for the whole period of the games , " ioc president jacques rogge told dpa news agency during an interview in lausanne , switzerland .

whereas once life expectancy hovered around 35 , now that number ’ s closer to 80 .
but will we all live to 100 ? it 's friday afternoon in the small town of bad lippspringe and 92-year-old anneliese bee is paying a visit to her daughter , granddaughter and great-granddaughter .
four generations in one room is uncommon , bee knows .
“ as old as i am - and still able to get around - that 's a rarity , ” said bee , who lives in her own apartment and regularly cooks lunch for her family .
“ my mother died at 68 , my father-in-law at 70 and my mother-in-law at 68 , ” said bee .
but as bee has grown older , the life expectancy of those living in industrialized lands has also increased .
it 's not as unusual as it once was to see people living to 80 or 90 .
“ over the last several years , we 've seen the average life expectancy continuously increase , ” said bettina sommer of the federal statistics office in wiesbaden .
“ if we go back to 130 years ago , we see the average life expectancy of a newborn has nearly doubled . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centenarian rosa richter received government congratulations on her 100th sommer , who heads a working group dealing specifically with life expectancy averages , says that a female born in germany today can anticipate seeing the ripe old age of 82 .
male newborns can expect to reach 76 on average .
the questionable value of statistics of course , these values are purely hypothetical - a palm reading of what 's possible in the future , if you will .
it remains impossible to predict on an individual basis just how long a person might live .
“ naturally , not all people who lived 130 years ago died at the age of 38 , ” said sommer .
“ many people died young , but there 's a good chance that others lived to be more than 60 or 70 years old . ”
the statistics likewise need to be adjusted according to infant mortality rates .
a high early death rate can decrease life expectancy tremendously .
one statistical possibility considers the notion that while two of four people live to be 80 years old , the other two die at birth .
that model makes for an average age of 40 .
at the same time , if we consider a group of four people in which only one person dies at birth and the other three reach the age of 80 , the life expectancy has suddenly jumped to 60 .
some countries moving in the opposite direction sinking infant mortality rates , then , have a lot to do with increasing life expectancy .
and in many countries , those rates have gone down thanks to medical advancements .
threats to infants and young children have substantially decreased due to the development of vaccines and antibiotics .
“ that 's definitely contributed to the sharp increase in life expectancy , ” said sommer .
“ and over the last century , the lifespan of older people has also increased . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children born in southern africa have greater problems aging at least that 's true for germany , which ranks among the countries with the longest average life .
unfortunately , that life increase has n't reached everywhere in the world , said sommer .
“ while these advancements over the last century have been felt across the world , there are likewise countries which are moving in the opposite direction . ”
in lands where aids is rampant , where many young people lose their lives in that battle , the life expectancy is sinking .
in southern african nations , the average lifespan is under 40 years .
the trend troubles many and aid agencies are working hard against the aids epidemic while also struggling to bring down infant mortality rates .
your chances of growing older increase with age while it may sound like common sense , the common belief now is that for every year you 've lived through , you 've increased your life expectancy .
the older a person grows , the better his or her chances are to become even older .
a 20-year-old can expect a higher lifespan than a newborn child because the 20-year-old has lived through the dangers of childhood and adolescence .
“ whoever is 80 today has a good chance of turning 81 tomorrow .
but a newborn first has to reach the age of 80 , ” said sommer .
that 's proven no problem for the spry and spirited 92-year-old anneliese bee .
but although she 's feeling mentally at her peak , her body has begun to show its age .
she 's grown hard of hearing , has osteoarthrosis and is a bit unsteady on her feet .
a year ago , she fell off her bike .
afterward , her doctor tried to prescribe her a walker to help her get around but she 'll have none of that .

but will we all live to 100 ? it 's friday afternoon in the small town of bad lippspringe and 92-year-old anneliese bee is paying a visit to her daughter , granddaughter and great-granddaughter .
four generations in one room is uncommon , bee knows .
“ as old as i am - and still able to get around - that 's a rarity , ” said bee , who lives in her own apartment and regularly cooks lunch for her family .
“ my mother died at 68 , my father-in-law at 70 and my mother-in-law at 68 , ” said bee .
but as bee has grown older , the life expectancy of those living in industrialized lands has also increased .
it 's not as unusual as it once was to see people living to 80 or 90 .
“ over the last several years , we 've seen the average life expectancy continuously increase , ” said bettina sommer of the federal statistics office in wiesbaden .
“ if we go back to 130 years ago , we see the average life expectancy of a newborn has nearly doubled . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centenarian rosa richter received government congratulations on her 100th sommer , who heads a working group dealing specifically with life expectancy averages , says that a female born in germany today can anticipate seeing the ripe old age of 82 .

the questionable value of statistics of course , these values are purely hypothetical - a palm reading of what 's possible in the future , if you will .
it remains impossible to predict on an individual basis just how long a person might live .
“ naturally , not all people who lived 130 years ago died at the age of 38 , ” said sommer .
“ many people died young , but there 's a good chance that others lived to be more than 60 or 70 years old . ”
the statistics likewise need to be adjusted according to infant mortality rates .
a high early death rate can decrease life expectancy tremendously .
one statistical possibility considers the notion that while two of four people live to be 80 years old , the other two die at birth .
that model makes for an average age of 40 .
at the same time , if we consider a group of four people in which only one person dies at birth and the other three reach the age of 80 , the life expectancy has suddenly jumped to 60 .
some countries moving in the opposite direction sinking infant mortality rates , then , have a lot to do with increasing life expectancy .
and in many countries , those rates have gone down thanks to medical advancements .
threats to infants and young children have substantially decreased due to the development of vaccines and antibiotics .
“ that 's definitely contributed to the sharp increase in life expectancy , ” said sommer .
“ and over the last century , the lifespan of older people has also increased . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children born in southern africa have greater problems aging at least that 's true for germany , which ranks among the countries with the longest average life .
unfortunately , that life increase has n't reached everywhere in the world , said sommer .
“ while these advancements over the last century have been felt across the world , there are likewise countries which are moving in the opposite direction . ”
in lands where aids is rampant , where many young people lose their lives in that battle , the life expectancy is sinking .

in an interview with dpa news agency in wolfsburg , he deflated predictions that millions of people would be driving electric cars by the middle of the 2010s as " very optimistic . "
leohold said volkswagen would sell electric models , but cautioned , " it will take 20 to 25 years before electric cars achieve a market share of more than 10 per cent . "
volkswagen 's first electric car would be a small car due out in 2010 , but bigger ones might follow .
" we have an ambition to electrify more than just the really small cars , but also our main model series , the golf , " he said .
leohold said research into lithium-ion batteries had made big jumps , but the items were still far too expensive .
he said electric motors would never replace internal-combustion engines in some sectors , such as long-distance heavy trucks .
" at the moment it is inconceivable they could ever be powered by batteries , " he said , adding that there was still major potential to make petrol and diesel engines more efficient .
separately , the german weekly magazine focus reported saturday that a key aim behind a takeover bid from german ball-bearings company schaeffler for tyremaker continental was a plan to jointly develop electric and other energy-saving engines .
both companies make mechanical sub-systems for cars .
schaeffler takeover deal include efficiency clause focus said schaeffler chief executive juergen geissinger wanted to combine his company 's valve controls with continental 's fuel- injection and exhaust-recycling technology to make combustion engines more efficient .
they could also jointly develop gearless electric traction motors for cars , the magazine said .
in a report to appear sunday in the newspaper welt am sonntag , continental chief executive manfred wennemer opposed the takeover but said he welcomed schaeffler owning up to 20 per cent of his firm .

" the eu has exhausted its room for maneuver in agriculture and can not go any further .
so we will not be making any further concessions , " said anne-marie idrac , a french government minister in charge of foreign trade .
idrac was speaking on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of eu ministers , convened in brussels to prepare the groundwork for next week 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks where 30 nations will try to salvage a set of long-floundering trade liberalization negotiations .
those talks will address the so-called doha round , which seek to bring down global trade barriers .
the negotiations have been dragging on since the round was launched in the qatar capital in november 2001 , amid disputes over subsidies to farmers by the us and eu and tariffs on industrial goods imposed by the developing economies of asia and latin america .
the 27-member eu runs the risk of being divided , with its southern members focused primarily on the agricultural sector and its northern members more interested in the services and industrial sectors .
but idrac insisted on friday that ministers had agreed to be united in strength .
the minister also reaffirmed the member states ' backing for the eu 's chief negotiator , trade commissioner peter mandelson , in spite of the fact that her president , nicolas sarkozy , had openly criticized his anti-protectionist stance only a month ago .
eu trade chief warns of failure mandelson on thursday said that a failure to reach a deal in geneva would hamper economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says failure could hamper economic growth the commissioner also said the eu was willing to accept a compromise deal drafted by wto head pascal lamy on the gradual reduction of eu import tariffs on bananas from latin america .
the eu currently offers more favorable conditions to banana exporters from its former colonies in africa , the pacific and the caribbean -lrb- apc -rrb- .
idrac said the eu would have to " strike a balance " between the requests of latin american producers , the need to encourage economic growth in the poorer apc countries , and the interests of the eu 's own banana producers .
the minister also called for an effective " anti-concentration " clause to be included in the rounds .
the clause , which is designed to prevent developing countries from defending entire sectors of their economy , has been strongly criticized by india .
one german government minister said next week 's talks had a " 50 to 50 chance " of succeeding .

" we are keenly interested in a deal ... however that deal has to be balanced . "
he also refused to rule out the possibility of ireland vetoing any trade deal that did not suit dublin , describing it as an " option . "

" the eu has exhausted its room for maneuver in agriculture and can not go any further .
so we will not be making any further concessions , " said anne-marie idrac , a french government minister in charge of foreign trade .
idrac was speaking on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of eu ministers , convened in brussels to prepare the groundwork for next week 's world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks where 30 nations will try to salvage a set of long-floundering trade liberalization negotiations .
those talks will address the so-called doha round , which seek to bring down global trade barriers .
the negotiations have been dragging on since the round was launched in the qatar capital in november 2001 , amid disputes over subsidies to farmers by the us and eu and tariffs on industrial goods imposed by the developing economies of asia and latin america .
the 27-member eu runs the risk of being divided , with its southern members focused primarily on the agricultural sector and its northern members more interested in the services and industrial sectors .
but idrac insisted on friday that ministers had agreed to be united in strength .
the minister also reaffirmed the member states ' backing for the eu 's chief negotiator , trade commissioner peter mandelson , in spite of the fact that her president , nicolas sarkozy , had openly criticized his anti-protectionist stance only a month ago .
eu trade chief warns of failure mandelson on thursday said that a failure to reach a deal in geneva would hamper economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says failure could hamper economic growth the commissioner also said the eu was willing to accept a compromise deal drafted by wto head pascal lamy on the gradual reduction of eu import tariffs on bananas from latin america .
the eu currently offers more favorable conditions to banana exporters from its former colonies in africa , the pacific and the caribbean -lrb- apc -rrb- .
idrac said the eu would have to " strike a balance " between the requests of latin american producers , the need to encourage economic growth in the poorer apc countries , and the interests of the eu 's own banana producers .
the minister also called for an effective " anti-concentration " clause to be included in the rounds .
the clause , which is designed to prevent developing countries from defending entire sectors of their economy , has been strongly criticized by india .
one german government minister said next week 's talks had a " 50 to 50 chance " of succeeding .

" i am awaiting a concrete and detailed explanation from germany , " vladimir spidla told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily during a conference in bonn .
" germany must provide -lrb- an explanation -rrb- , then i will see if the arguments are convincing , " the former czech prime minister added .
earlier this week , the german government said it would ease rules for highly qualified immigrants from new eu states seeking work to fill yawning gaps in the german job market .
the government also reduced the minimum wage highly-skilled foreigners have to earn to secure a work permit to 63,600 euros -lrb- $ 101,200 -rrb- per year from 86,400 euros .
welcome mat for skilled workers like many industrialized nations , germany is struggling to fill thousands of vacant jobs requiring a high level of skills and expertise .
german business have long complained of a dearth of skilled workers in the country and the new measures are an effort to plug a shortage of skilled labour in sectors such as engineering and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces a huge shortage of engineers the shortage of computer technicians , engineers and other skilled workers is costing europe 's largest economy around 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.8 billion -rrb- a year , according to estimates by the government and the dihk chambers of industry and commerce .
" we have taken a step toward making germany more competitive internationally , " social democrat labor minister olaf scholz said earlier this week .
" we are putting the conditions in place so that people can come here who can contribute to creating economic growth . "
raw deal for unskilled immigrants ?
however , the proposals include keeping germany 's labor market closed to unskilled workers from new eu member states for two years longer than planned .
germany is one of a handful of eu states still restricting workers from nations that joined the bloc in 2004 .
unskilled workers from the 10 countries that joined the eu in may , 2004 , excluding cyprus and malta , will not be allowed in until april 2011 , compared with an original date of the end of april , 2009 .
cheap workers from romania and bulgaria will continue to be excluded until the end of 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spidla wants germany to explain its bar on unskilled workers when the eu expanded to take in 10 new members in 2004 , berlin at the time cited fears that a flood of cheap labor would put germans out of work due to germany 's geographic proximity to the new member states .
the german unemployment rate has since fallen from the double-digit range to 7.5 percent in june .
spidla said that while eu states could maintain restrictions until 2011 , " each government must prove there are risks of serious disruption to its labor market .

but not all were ready to accept the apology .
lobby groups for victims demanded more cash compensation and life-long care .
the 81-year-old pontiff acknowledged " the shame which we have all felt as a result of the sexual abuse of minors by some clergy and religious in this country . "
speaking at a mass with senior clergy at the cathedral where he is staying for a catholic youth festival , benedict said he was " deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have endured , and i assure them that , as their pastor , i , too , share in their suffering . "
" these misdeeds , which constitute so grave a betrayal of trust , deserve unequivocal condemnation .
they have caused great pain .
they have damaged the church 's witness , " the pope said .
the pope is in sydney for week-long world youth day celebrations , which conclude sunday with a papal mass at a city racecourse .
" in these days marked by the celebration of world youth day , we are reminded of how precious a treasure has been entrusted to us in our young people , and how great a part of the church 's mission in this country has been dedicated to their education and care , " the german-born pope said .

" would he like to roll his sleeves up and come to my office and be here ... everyday on the phone and meeting with these people and their families and doing all the trauma work ?
that 's what we need to see , those kinds of really practical social justice actions , " she added .
last week , cardinal george pell , leader of australia 's 5 million catholics , reiterated his apology to a couple blighted by a sexual abuse case in melbourne dating back to the 1980s .
the couple have demanded a meeting with the pope .
pell described as " tragic " the case of emma foster , who committed suicide earlier this year at the age of 26 .
her sister , katherine , who was also raped by melbourne priest kevin o 'donnell when she was a primary school pupil , was an alcoholic when she was rendered disabled by a drunk driver in 1999 .
" i apologized to emma in 1998 , " cardinal pell said .
" i met with her parents .
we offered them some financial help .
we also offered them counseling .
emma availed herself of that counseling for 10 years , and we contributed substantially towards those counseling costs . "

schaeuble shut down german offices of danish-based roj tv earlier this year and declared it no longer had a licence to broadcast in germany , although its satellite signal can still be easily picked up by viewers inside germany .
the kurdish rebel group pkk this month kidnapped three german mountaineers on mount ararat in eastern turkey in anger at the move .
focus said the secret bka analysis suggested that " a personal risk to the minister is conceivable . "
focus said the bka had also advised the german foreign ministry to expand its current " urgent " warning against travel by germans to kurdish areas .
it urged the ministry to advise vacationers against visiting any part of turkey at all . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is past 900 and rising .
soon , that number will be reset to zero , when the democratic party 's presidential nominee addresses what many see as his achilles heel : his foreign policy credentials .
a recent washington post / abc poll suggests that 72 % of americans think his republican rival , john mccain , would be a good commander-in-chief .
less than half say that about obama .
of course , the illinois senator is addressing this weakness in the fevered atmosphere of an election campaign .
his trip to the middle east and europe , which began on saturday with a visit to afghanistan , must be seen in this context .
perceived changes in policy will be highlighted , but , in many ways , this is more about the impression he leaves , the perceived gaffes he makes and the photo opportunities he collects .
all will be used for campaign purposes - by both sides .
pressing problems the upsides of the trip are clear .
obama will see - at close range - some of the most pressing international problems facing the next us president , whoever it may be .
if he plays his cards right , he will appear statesmanlike , well-briefed - presidential .
he will be able to sprinkle future campaign speeches with references to leaders and citizens whom he met .
the downsides are apparent , too . "
angela merkel may have done him a favour by apparently blocking his alleged plans for a speech at berlin 's brandenburg gate " on the european leg of his trip , obama is likely to be greeted by large , curious and excited crowds .
obamamania will go global .
yet , while such images may help bolster the sense that he is best-placed to improve america 's image in the world , they could also create the impression of an arrogant candidate , who has crossed the line between appearing ready to lead and acting as though he is already in charge .
so , the german leader , angela merkel , may have done him a favour by apparently blocking his alleged plans for a speech at berlin 's brandenburg gate .
would such an event - with its echoes of ronald reagan 's famous address at the same venue - go down well with most american voters or appear a rhetorical gesture too far ?
it could go either way .
body language although for security reasons it has not yet been confirmed when the senator will be making a stop-off in iraq , it is probably his most eagerly-awaited visit .
in recent days , senator obama has restated his intention to pull us combat troops out of the country within 16 months of taking office .
he has , at the same time , retained the option of leaving behind ill-defined " supporting " forces .
he has also talked about " refining " his views , after meeting commanders on the ground ; a choice of verb , which provoked republican accusations of inconsistency .
so , when he sees those military leaders , he will have to show that he understands their concerns and goals and - perhaps - convince them that his vision would not bind them to unrealistic timetables , which could undermine iraq 's recent , hard-won security gains .
expect the body language from that meeting to be analysed even more than the words .
words matter , though - as senator obama often says - and he is likely to be quizzed on his choice of them when he enters the difficult realm of the israeli-palestinian conflict .
last month , in a speech to the american israel public affairs committee , he said : " jerusalem will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided . "
that controversial reference to an undivided jerusalem -lrb- which obama has since conceded was " poor phrasing " -rrb- drew criticism from the palestinians and makes his visit to the middle east even more sensitive than it was .
republicans , after all , had previously been labelling him the " candidate of hamas " - after a member of that militant organisation said positive things about him .
but - despite the potential pitfalls - most analysts agree that barack obama had to make this trip .
with his major speeches on race and religion he has shown a tendency to directly address perceived weaknesses .
that is what he appears to be doing again .
speeches are much easier to control , though , than week-long trips across the world .

deadlock within the executive was delaying implementation of reforms to the pps 14 ban on building in rural areas , the dup minister said .
he said he feared other politicians wanted to unpick a compromise agreed by a cross-party working group .
" we 're not going to have a free-for-all which destroys one of our most valuable assets , the beautiful landscape . "
the controversial pps 14 planning policy , which outlaws new single rural dwellings , is one of a number of pressing issues not yet agreed upon by the executive .
amid growing signs of political stalemate and indecision within the stormont executive , other issues to be resolved include the proposed maze stadium , post-primary education , the planned education and skills authority and water charges .
' unlawful ' last september , the pps 14 planning policy was ruled unlawful as it was introduced by the department of regional development which did not have the power to do so .
a high court judge later ruled the law would not be overturned but it is due to be reviewed .
mr wilson told the bbc 's inside politics programme : " there are some who , quite frankly , would just like a free-for-all of building in the countryside , and i am not prepared to let that happen .
" there are rural parts of northern ireland that i want to see preserved . "

deadlock within the executive was delaying implementation of reforms to the pps 14 ban on building in rural areas , the dup minister said .
he said he feared other politicians wanted to unpick a compromise agreed by a cross-party working group .
" we 're not going to have a free-for-all which destroys one of our most valuable assets , the beautiful landscape . "
the controversial pps 14 planning policy , which outlaws new single rural dwellings , is one of a number of pressing issues not yet agreed upon by the executive .
amid growing signs of political stalemate and indecision within the stormont executive , other issues to be resolved include the proposed maze stadium , post-primary education , the planned education and skills authority and water charges .
' unlawful ' last september , the pps 14 planning policy was ruled unlawful as it was introduced by the department of regional development which did not have the power to do so .
a high court judge later ruled the law would not be overturned but it is due to be reviewed .
mr wilson told the bbc 's inside politics programme : " there are some who , quite frankly , would just like a free-for-all of building in the countryside , and i am not prepared to let that happen .
" there are rural parts of northern ireland that i want to see preserved . "

leader of the welsh conservatives nick bourne said the matter was n't a " resigning issue " .

" certainly he has all the credentials , he has been involved in running a welsh language tv production company in the past , he was the leader of gwynedd council , so he would very much be a safe pair of hands .

in his resignation letter to mr morgan , he wrote : " in the light of the publicity that has been following me in the last weeks i feel that my position in the government is no longer sustainable .
" further comments would be bound to follow .
it has been a privilege to be part of this government during this exceedingly exciting period . "

broken rites , which had wanted the pope to meet some of the victims in person , said the pontiff 's apology " is not enough " .
" victims want action , not just words , " the group said in a statement .
broken rites says there have been 107 convictions against catholic clergymen on sex charges in australia .
but the campaigners estimate the number of victims to be in the thousands .
there was no immediate confirmation of whether the pope would meet abuse victims - as he did during a us trip in april , when he also expressed shame for the scandal .
the bbc 's nick bryant , in sydney , says victims have complained that the church in australia has tried to stall compensation claims and cover up certain cases .
on saturday , several hundred protesters rallied in sydney against the pope 's opposition to homosexuality and contraception .
police said there were minor scuffles as some of the demonstrators pelted catholic pilgrims with condoms .
