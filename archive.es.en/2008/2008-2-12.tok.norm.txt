it would not affect me that much .
i can tell that things have become more expensive overall , but not too much ; it 's just the normal kind of inflation process for most products . it 's hard for me to tell because i often have the impression that they randomly make some products more expensive in small shops , the kind of shops where i go .
if a product sells well , for example , and that 's because they know that the people who live here are tied to them so they can afford to lift prices sometimes .
i buy sardines very often and i can see they are popular in this particular shop because they have more and more kinds , and they 're more expensive in a very obvious way .
so we 're talking about a store that can afford to manipulate prices because they 're the only one around here - and it 's difficult to set up a shop in the old town . how easy is it for you to get by ? i earn a rather high wage so i certainly do n't struggle .
but i 'm also lucky because i own an apartment and do n't have to pay a mortgage .
i think most people who are in my income bracket with a steady job will very often be burdened by a mortgage , which might mean they sometimes have problems .
i 'm lucky enough to have this apartment that was given to me by my dad .
i earn well and i have a rather wealthy family .
i might not be the most representative consumer . what about for most people in poland is it easy for them to get by financially ? it depends .
people i know from work who are journalists will probably earn around 6,000 zloty -lrb- 1,658 euros , $ 2,447 -rrb- per month before taxes , and if they have a mortgage , like most of them do , then sometimes they will struggle .
but they do n't struggle to the extent where they ca n't afford to go out and have something to eat in town once a month or have a few drinks .
generally i do n't see them as being handicapped in their leisure time or social life .
of course , they can not afford to go out every night and have meals in restaurants all the time . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? i 'm worried that the finance market crash in the united states will somehow affect the european economy , especially the british economy since it 's a bit more tied up and similar to the american economy .

that 's really something that puts us behind emerging economies like india and china and the united states , obviously , the fact that we do n't move enough . in saying that , i know how many poles have moved to england recently and i know what kind of effect it has on the british and the polish economies , how positive overall this is .
i 'm sure that there will be people in britain who might not be happy about having this flood of immigrants going there , but i think that it gave a boost to the british economy . it gave a boost to the polish economy , because , first of all , the unemployment rate fell and , secondly , because people often send money back home .
when they come back those people would have benefitted enormously , because just being in another culture , to see the know-how , they would have learnt the language , they might have established economic ties with britain .
i think that if there were more movements like that within europe it would certainly benefit everybody . nb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 12.02.2008 readers oppose turkish schools in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turks in germany not to give up their ethnicity when turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan visited germany this week , he sparked discussion on integration and took heat for his proposal to start turkish schools in germany .
here 's what some dw readers had to say . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as an american who grew up in a small town with many first generation italian and greek immigrants , i am familiar with the issue of integration .
it was my experience that my contemporaries whose parents came from the " old country " spoke italian or greek at home .
they learned english from the radio , tv , playmates and school .
notwithstanding that they spoke their parents ' language at home and carried on many of the parents ' traditions , their parents encouraged them to learn american culture and to " fit in . "
they did fit in ; no one cared what they spoke at home , and today you would n't know that their parents did n't come over on the mayflower .
integration does not mean you forget where you family came from , it is adapting to where you are . - james fraser , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2.4 million turks make up the largest minority group in germany i think the turkish authorities have to understand what the german authorities are saying because every country has the way they do things .
having schools with a mother tongue in another country is far from the game .
globally , they say when in rome , do like romans , so i think if you are in germany , do like the germans . - victor c. okeke , nigeria erdogan is very much correct .
turkish people should not give up their culture and identity .

turkey is unwilling to create common ground with europe .

here 's what some dw readers had to say . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as an american who grew up in a small town with many first generation italian and greek immigrants , i am familiar with the issue of integration .
it was my experience that my contemporaries whose parents came from the " old country " spoke italian or greek at home .
they learned english from the radio , tv , playmates and school .
notwithstanding that they spoke their parents ' language at home and carried on many of the parents ' traditions , their parents encouraged them to learn american culture and to " fit in . "
they did fit in ; no one cared what they spoke at home , and today you would n't know that their parents did n't come over on the mayflower .
integration does not mean you forget where you family came from , it is adapting to where you are . - james fraser , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2.4 million turks make up the largest minority group in germany i think the turkish authorities have to understand what the german authorities are saying because every country has the way they do things .
having schools with a mother tongue in another country is far from the game .
globally , they say when in rome , do like romans , so i think if you are in germany , do like the germans . - victor c. okeke , nigeria erdogan is very much correct .
turkish people should not give up their culture and identity .

however , it may be risky and i could never tell whether it is secured and safe or not due to bankruptcy and corruption ...
as my mom told us ever before when my sister planned to have an educational plan for my younger brother who was born 6 years ago .
so , our family decided to keep our savings and incomes deposited in our several bank accounts and one of those accounts is for my brother 's future tuition fees because he will be nearly grade 1 student this june after finishing his kindergarten course .
and for myself ... as long as i 'm still single and family-dependent , if i have already got my very first salary from my very first job -lrb- hoping ... -rrb- , i 'd rather contribute to our family income to support ourselves and the remaining part is for my own personal debts and savings ... even my future use ...
i was planning to study again as i want to pursue a master 's degree ...
now , in my general opinion , money can do anything .
once we have it , we can use it ... we can spend and invest everything such as " paluwagan " -lrb- filipino term for ... some kinda ... investment between friends or relatives -rrb- and having business as my former college professors did 1 1/2 years ago as they sell dimsums and drinks .
it 's better to do it ... but , the most important is to make it sure that this kind of investment should be in a right time and place . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 05 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit tagesthema we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

furthermore , he said , france 's influence over the deby regime is waning . " the reality is that the french have less real influence in central africa than ever before , " said glaser . glaser added that france would have evacuated deby when the rebels stormed the presidential palace 10 days ago , but the chadian president refused the offer and drove the opposition out with government troops .
deby 's intransigency and the strength of the resistance took the french leadership by surprise , said glaser . no political middle ground in chad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france underestimated the deby regime 's resistance to rebel and opposition groups " the french completely underestimated the backing for deby and thought the rebels would overrun the palace , " he said .
" once deby won , france had to decide either to fully support him or not at all .
in chad , there is no middle ground .
you are either in or you are out . " only days before the rebel attack , french defense minister herve morin said that france would maintain " neutrality " in the central african country , which borders the sudanese crisis region of darfur , where refugees have been fleeing ethnic wars . france was even ready to see deby go but was surprised by his tenacity at holding on to power , said alex de waal , a program director specializing in african issues at the social science research council in new york . " now the french government sees no alternative to supporting a despotic dictator , since the opposition is viewed as destabilizing , " said de waal . a european union force , made up largely of french troops and intended to stabilize chad 's eastern border with darfur , however , has been delayed due to rebel violence .

" the eu would have no choice but to support france , which supports deby , " said de waal .
" peacekeeping is a wonderful principle to protect african civilians , but it only works if the eu commits troops who are willing to fight and get killed . " analysts say that neither the germans nor the british are committing troops to the eu operation , partly because they suspect that france is using the eu umbrella to promote french national interests . the appointment of irishman pat nash as the mission 's commander-in-chief was not enough to convince germany to participate in a conflict dominated by the french , said dirk kohnert , an africa expert at the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg .

the world bank hopes the country would be able to support itself through its coal deposits .
some economists are not convinced it will be that easy . it could all happen on february 17 .
observers are expecting kosovo to declare its independence on sunday .
independence will give the albanian majority what it has been dreaming of : secession from serbia .
however , behind all the hope and optimism which stirs in the province ahead of the declaration there is still some uncertainty over whether kosovo - known during the cold war as " yugoslavia 's poorhouse " - will be able to support itself economically as a new nation state .
even today , kosovo rates as one of the poorest regions in europe .
according to the world bank , the average annual salary for the population is 1,243 euros -lrb- $ 1,803 -rrb- .
it reports that 37 percent of the population lives in poverty and survives on less than 1.42 euros a day .
those who suffer the most are the most vulnerable : the children , old people , families without male breadwinners , the disabled , the unemployed , and the non-serbian ethnic minorities like the roma .
poverty-stricken province ignoring realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the optimism is tempered by skepticism how can such a country survive economically ?
the skepticism increases in relation to the anticipation of imminent independence .
" the secessionists ignore the economic realities , " ruth wedgwood , a professor for international law and diplomacy at john hopkins university in baltimore , wrote in a commentary in the wall street journal on feb .
9 .
wedgwood is one of those who see kosovo as having little to gain from independence .
" kosovo has coal , lead and a workforce , but it lies in a corner of europe where only a few tourists ever go , " she wrote .
politically , she added , there is no need for kosovo to pursue independence now that slobodan milosevic is no longer in power .
franz kaps , the world bank 's special envoy to southern europe until may last year , sees things in less pessimistic terms .
now an independent advisor to the bank , kaps believes that it is kosovo 's coal reserves which will help support it through its transition to an independent state and beyond .
electricity demand a lifeline for kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's coal industry could be its economic savior southern europe , the world bank predicts , will need additional electricity of up to 4.5 gigawatts by 2012 .
kosovo sits on an estimated 15 billion tons of coal .
the potential for supply and demand is evident in these forecasted figures , but the state of kosovo 's coal industry will have to improve radically if the new state is to be the main provider of that extra power .
" if this succeeds , kosovo could even become an exporter of electricity , " kaps said .
however , the development of kosovo 's industry can only happen after political and juridical relations are made stable .
" the most important stabilization factor would be that kosovo and serbia are brought into the eu , " he added .
until kosovo gets on its feet , the country would have to rely on help from outside its new borders .
the money which flows in from kosovars in other countries is a main source of income to the province .
according to estimates , about 450 million euros per year comes in from the kosovar diaspora .
" this is the source of kosovo 's traditional economic aid , " said karl kaser , a professor for southeast-european history at the university of graz in austria .
donations and eu support could be key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo : cash donations accepted kaser can remember a time when this flow of money was even greater .
in the early 1980s , he visited the region and reported on a flow of cash coming from the north of yugoslavia to the south .
" at that time , one had the feeling that everything was improving , " said kaser .
“ everywhere there were new houses and hotels being built .
but then , in 1989 , the political problems began . "
kaser believes it will be impossible for kosovo to remain part of serbia .
a large part of kosovo 's population wants independence .
but with independence , the new country can forget about any help from belgrade .
" serbia has made it clear that it will not invest in an independent kosovo , " said kaser .
kosovo 's economic future lies with the eu and the creation of a stable government , he added .
for kosovo to develop a coal industry capable of sustaining the new country , it would need to attract foreign investors .
however , kaser fears that any investors would be in it for a fast buck and that any profits would soon be taken out of the country .
despite the uncertainty and obvious hard times ahead , kaser looks forward with optimism , and with no small amount of gallows humor , to an independent kosovo .

the world bank hopes the country would be able to support itself through its coal deposits .
some economists are not convinced it will be that easy . it could all happen on february 17 .
observers are expecting kosovo to declare its independence on sunday .
independence will give the albanian majority what it has been dreaming of : secession from serbia .
however , behind all the hope and optimism which stirs in the province ahead of the declaration there is still some uncertainty over whether kosovo - known during the cold war as " yugoslavia 's poorhouse " - will be able to support itself economically as a new nation state .
even today , kosovo rates as one of the poorest regions in europe .
according to the world bank , the average annual salary for the population is 1,243 euros -lrb- $ 1,803 -rrb- .
it reports that 37 percent of the population lives in poverty and survives on less than 1.42 euros a day .
those who suffer the most are the most vulnerable : the children , old people , families without male breadwinners , the disabled , the unemployed , and the non-serbian ethnic minorities like the roma .
poverty-stricken province ignoring realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the optimism is tempered by skepticism how can such a country survive economically ?
the skepticism increases in relation to the anticipation of imminent independence .
" the secessionists ignore the economic realities , " ruth wedgwood , a professor for international law and diplomacy at john hopkins university in baltimore , wrote in a commentary in the wall street journal on feb .
9 .
wedgwood is one of those who see kosovo as having little to gain from independence .
" kosovo has coal , lead and a workforce , but it lies in a corner of europe where only a few tourists ever go , " she wrote .
politically , she added , there is no need for kosovo to pursue independence now that slobodan milosevic is no longer in power .
franz kaps , the world bank 's special envoy to southern europe until may last year , sees things in less pessimistic terms .
now an independent advisor to the bank , kaps believes that it is kosovo 's coal reserves which will help support it through its transition to an independent state and beyond .
electricity demand a lifeline for kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's coal industry could be its economic savior southern europe , the world bank predicts , will need additional electricity of up to 4.5 gigawatts by 2012 .
kosovo sits on an estimated 15 billion tons of coal .
the potential for supply and demand is evident in these forecasted figures , but the state of kosovo 's coal industry will have to improve radically if the new state is to be the main provider of that extra power .
" if this succeeds , kosovo could even become an exporter of electricity , " kaps said .
however , the development of kosovo 's industry can only happen after political and juridical relations are made stable .
" the most important stabilization factor would be that kosovo and serbia are brought into the eu , " he added .
until kosovo gets on its feet , the country would have to rely on help from outside its new borders .

" we are certain the iranians are engaged in serious clandestine operations to build an unconventional weapon , " he said .
olmert also brushed aside suggestions that iran was no longer a danger after a us intelligence report in december found that tehran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
the israeli prime minister referred to iran 's continued pursuit of uranium enrichment as justification for his country 's belief that iran was receiving nuclear fuel from russia for something other than a civilian nuclear program .
olmert said there could be no other reason for iran 's activities .
" the iranians are moving forward with their plans to create a capacity for non-conventional weapons .
there is evidence that the plan of the iranians is not that naive and innocent , " olmert said .
" this is a main challenge .
we ca n't afford to make one mistake on that issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is highly suspicious of president ahmadinejad " this is mainly the challenge of the big powers ; israel inevitably is ... very interested in these efforts and we will join forces and cooperate with our senior friends in order to help a possible solution that will deter the iranians from continuing their program , " the prime minister added .
asked whether a military response was still an option , olmert cited us president george w. bush as saying that " no option is ruled out . "
support for diplomacy merkel said germany would continue its dual strategy of pressing iran to comply with the demands of the international community on halting enrichment and of offering economic incentives if it did .
" i have said over and over again that i firmly believe in a solution by diplomatic means and that i am banking on a diplomatic solution , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reiterated her diplomatic stance to olmert germany , along with the five permanent members of the un security council , was currently working on the text of a third resolution on iran , she noted .
olmert also spoke of the palestinian situation , saying that israel faced a " very unusual situation " in attempting to conduct negotiations while at the same time coming under attack , not only from gaza but from other parts of the palestinian territories .
the prime minister did , however , vow to fight terrorism from hamas-controlled gaza " in every possible manner " but refused to directly comment on statements made by israeli defense minister ehud barak , who indicated monday that israel might try to overthrow the hamas regime .
gaza-based terrorism " the israeli government under my leadership is absolutely determined to respond to the challenge of terrorism from gaza in every possible manner which will be effective , " olmert said at the press conference .
" we will not hesitate , we will not stop and we will do what 's necessary to be done . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could israel be preparing an offensive against hamas ?
in a veiled reference to barak 's statements , olmert said : " i know that there are lots of speculations ... discussions ... suggestions and propositions everywhere of what we can do exactly , " he added .
" that , i 'm afraid , i will not share with you . "
at the same time , he said israel " will continue our negotiations with the palestinian authority " under west bank-based president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad .
chancellor passes merkel refused to criticize israel 's current blockade of gaza and the restriction of electricity supplies .
" i know that the humanitarian situation in gaza strip is difficult , and we are trying to help in this regard where we can , " she said .
" but the simplest answer is that the targeting of the israeli state , the terrorist activities must be ended , " merkel added .

but the debate over whether scientology is a sect or a genuine religion is sure to continue . an administrative appellate court in muenster handed down the verdict in the case , brought by the scientology organization , which challenged an early decision allowing government surveillance . the muenster judges found that the federal office for the protection of the constitution was within its authority to keep scientologists under observation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of a new scientology center in berlin last year stirred controversy in the statement announcing the verdict , the court said that there were " numerous indications " that the scientology organization promoted a form of society " in which central constitutional values such as the dignity of mankind and the right to equal treatment would be suspended or restricted . " " in particular , there is the suspicion that in a scientological society only scientologists would enjoy civil rights , " the court decided . the office for the protection of the constitution , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , has had scientology under surveillance since 1997 . misunderstood faith or public hazard ? the organization itself argued that it is a religious association that does not pursue political goals in the sense of the laws established to protect germany 's constitution . but the court rejected the argument , deeming it irrelevant to a case for or against surveillance . germany officially considers scientology a business rather than a religion .
no charges have ever been brought as a result of government surveillance . nonetheless , the court said the scientology movement was " trying to expand personally and to spread scientological principles more and more within government , the economy and society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor tom cruise is one of the movement 's most prominent members scientology was set up by author l. ron hubbard in 1954 in the united states .
the organization 's official web site describes its aims as seeking " only evolution to higher states of being for the individual and for society . " the german court also heard testimony concerning a number of anti-democratic remarks made by hubbard .
the court found that no evidence of the movement distancing itself from those opinions . the church of scientology says it will appeal the ruling and called for an end to the surveillance . " the german federal office for the protection of the constitution should finally end this farce and turn its attention to real enemies of the constitution and real danger so as to do what it is there for : to protect the german constitution and the basic rights of the people , " the organization said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are executives ' earnings obscene excess or legitimate incentive ?
a small-business owner in switzerland -lrb- known for being pro-business -rrb- is pushing through a referendum that would lop off the superfluous zeros . thomas minder gets a bit angry when he talks about severance packages and bonuses for managers . " those things come from the us and they 're not normal here in switzerland , " he said .
" this kind of corporate policy is sick and has to be changed . " minder , a small business owner from neuhausen am rheinfall in switzerland , has launched an initiative against exorbitant salaries for managers .
he says it 's unjust that some executives earn 600 times more than an average worker - and are even rewarded with seven-digit severance payments when they do a poor job and are dismissed . after a year and a half of campaigning , minder has nearly collected the 100,000 signatures that are necessary in switzerland for a referendum .
he and the signatories want the government to put an end to disproportionate executive salaries . salt in the wound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minder was hit hard when swiss air went bankrupt the reason behind minder 's efforts is personal .
about six years ago , swiss air placed a large order for hand lotion , lip balm and tooth paste with his small cosmetic company .
when the airline declared bankruptcy shortly thereafter , minder 's firm was stuck with a pile of toiletries and an unpaid bill . " when it came out a few months later that the ceo had gotten a settlement worth 12.5 million francs -lrb- 7.8 million euros , $ 11.4 million -rrb- , the world collapsed for us , " said minder . his campaign has hit a nerve with the swiss .
manager salaries in switzerland continue to rise disproportionately to workers ' wages - just like in germany , where the debate heated up several weeks ago . according to the investment management fund ethos , executive earnings at switzerland 's 20 largest companies rose 17 percent from 2005 to 2006 .
workers ' wages , on the other hand , only increased by 2.5 percent at most . unusual , but not unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is a direct democracy the discrepancy upsets a lot of people , said political scientist thomas milic from the university of zurich . milic , whose research focuses on public referenda , said that milic 's referendum has a chance , even though statistics suggest the contrary .
of the 200 or so petitions for referenda that have come from the swiss populace , only 15 have gone through , he said . once the 100,000 required signatures have been collected , the parliament has to put it to a public vote within three years , according to swiss law .
milic warned , though , that the government tends to water down the laws before they are voted on and present them side-by-side with counter-proposals . however , minder has the politicians on his side , too .
the social democrats , the green party and a leftist splinter party are behind his initiative ; only the right-wing swiss people 's party has n't yet taken a position . stockholders to take charge if minder 's demands are taken on by the electorate , companies listed on swiss stock exchange would have to make some changes .
the initiative calls for banning termination pay , advances and bonuses for selling or buying a company . what 's more , stockholders would determine executives ' salaries , not executives themselves .
minder aims to protect the company owners from the " boundless greed " of its executives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the chances are good for minder 's initiative still , he does n't see himself as a socialist crusader .
" i think civically and very liberally , " he said .
" the proposal is quite business friendly . " pressure from market-minded swiss wolf linder , a political scientist at the university of berne , said he did n't think minder 's proposal was business-friendly enough . " the swiss think in a much more economically liberal way than the germans , " he said .
even if it comes to a referendum , the people wo n't approve the bill , he added . still , the swiss are clearly concerned about the issue .

are executives ' earnings obscene excess or legitimate incentive ?
a small-business owner in switzerland -lrb- known for being pro-business -rrb- is pushing through a referendum that would lop off the superfluous zeros . thomas minder gets a bit angry when he talks about severance packages and bonuses for managers . " those things come from the us and they 're not normal here in switzerland , " he said .
" this kind of corporate policy is sick and has to be changed . " minder , a small business owner from neuhausen am rheinfall in switzerland , has launched an initiative against exorbitant salaries for managers .
he says it 's unjust that some executives earn 600 times more than an average worker - and are even rewarded with seven-digit severance payments when they do a poor job and are dismissed . after a year and a half of campaigning , minder has nearly collected the 100,000 signatures that are necessary in switzerland for a referendum .
he and the signatories want the government to put an end to disproportionate executive salaries . salt in the wound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minder was hit hard when swiss air went bankrupt the reason behind minder 's efforts is personal .
about six years ago , swiss air placed a large order for hand lotion , lip balm and tooth paste with his small cosmetic company .
when the airline declared bankruptcy shortly thereafter , minder 's firm was stuck with a pile of toiletries and an unpaid bill . " when it came out a few months later that the ceo had gotten a settlement worth 12.5 million francs -lrb- 7.8 million euros , $ 11.4 million -rrb- , the world collapsed for us , " said minder . his campaign has hit a nerve with the swiss .
manager salaries in switzerland continue to rise disproportionately to workers ' wages - just like in germany , where the debate heated up several weeks ago . according to the investment management fund ethos , executive earnings at switzerland 's 20 largest companies rose 17 percent from 2005 to 2006 .
workers ' wages , on the other hand , only increased by 2.5 percent at most . unusual , but not unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is a direct democracy the discrepancy upsets a lot of people , said political scientist thomas milic from the university of zurich . milic , whose research focuses on public referenda , said that milic 's referendum has a chance , even though statistics suggest the contrary .
of the 200 or so petitions for referenda that have come from the swiss populace , only 15 have gone through , he said . once the 100,000 required signatures have been collected , the parliament has to put it to a public vote within three years , according to swiss law .
milic warned , though , that the government tends to water down the laws before they are voted on and present them side-by-side with counter-proposals . however , minder has the politicians on his side , too .
the social democrats , the green party and a leftist splinter party are behind his initiative ; only the right-wing swiss people 's party has n't yet taken a position . stockholders to take charge if minder 's demands are taken on by the electorate , companies listed on swiss stock exchange would have to make some changes .
the initiative calls for banning termination pay , advances and bonuses for selling or buying a company . what 's more , stockholders would determine executives ' salaries , not executives themselves .
minder aims to protect the company owners from the " boundless greed " of its executives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the chances are good for minder 's initiative still , he does n't see himself as a socialist crusader .

massive numbers of germany fans have been clamoring for euro 2008 tickets since the lottery process started in earnest .
unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far . the swiss and austrian organizers of euro 2008 may be taking a page out of germany 's book when it comes to trying to emulate the success of the world cup two years ago , but it seems that the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- itself has forgotten one of its main mistakes from 2006 . while the world cup in germany has been lauded as one of the most successfully organized global soccer events in modern history , one of the few aspects to cause chaos and consternation was the allocation of tickets . the complicated online lottery process , the exorbitant prices , the credit card monopolies and the minute numbers of tickets actually available to the everyday fan were just some of the complaints that dogged the almost-perfect tournament .
two years on , the dfb looks to have forgotten the stress and strain german fans went through to see their team play international soccer . a staggering 1.5 million tickets were requested by germany fans for the 14,400 available for their country 's three euro 2008 pool games in austria , the dfb said on wednesday , feb .
13 .
applications , whcih the dfb called " overwhelming , " closed at midnight on tuesday , leaving fans of joachim loew 's boys were again facing heartbreak . german fans destined for ticket disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niersbach had to try and rob goleo to get a world cup ticket " it seems to be german fans ' mission impossible to get tickets for euro 2008 , " dfb secretary-general wolfgang niersbuch said .
" unfortunately , there will be only a few joyful winners and it is a pity we have so few tickets to give away in a drawing which will take place at the end of the month . " the dfb , he admitted , was only handing over 14,400 of the 21,765 tickets it has to fans . " we also have to give tickets to our committees , the bundesliga clubs , the regional organizations , our sponsors and the players ' families get an allocation too , " niersbuch said . after the success of the 2006 world cup , the demand for germany 's first round matches against poland -lrb- june 8 -rrb- and croatia -lrb- june 12 -rrb- in the southern austrian city of klagenfurt , plus the clash with hosts austria in vienna -lrb- june 16 -rrb- , has gone through the roof . but the dfb can not be held fully responsible for the imminent distress .
some of the venues for the european championships are less than equipped for dealing with fans ' demands than the ticket allocation process itself . for example , germany 's potential group deciding clash against croatia in klagenfurt takes place in the 32,000-capacity hypo group arena , a stadium much smaller than many bundesliga venues . black market preparing for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rival fans may end up together with black market tickets for the two games in klagenfurt , the dfb gets 5,722 tickets per game with 10,321 available for the game against austria at the ernst happel stadium , which has a capacity of 50,000 . the result could see huge numbers of fans descending on the venues ahead of the games willing to part company with large sums of cash for tickets in various areas of the arenas , leading to security issues . with games against bitter rivals poland , notoriously volatile croatia and neighbors austria , placing germany fans in opposition blocks is something the authorities will want to avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 12.02.2008 french support for chad dictator makes eu uneasy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french defense minister morin supported chad 's president after a rebel crackdown after rebels were driven out of chad in a bloody battle , france , which had been seeking a neutral role in the volatile region , reverted to its traditional post-colonial policy of supporting an african dictator . since he was elected in may last year , french president nicolas sarkozy pledged to break away from the embarrassing old habit of propping up autocratic and corrupt ex-colonial regimes in africa . but sarkozy broke his promise last week after a brutal rebel attack in n 'djamena that left scores of civilians dead and forced tens of thousands to flee the chadian capital . the french government came down on the side of chad 's strongman idriss deby , who rose to power in a 1990 coup that had the blessing of sarkozy 's predecessors , leading observers to concluded that the more things change in france 's traditional africa policy , the more they remain the same . france ruled by national interests bildunterschrift : france has been pushing for an eu mission to stabilize chad 's border with darfur that policy , called francafrique , meant serving france 's strategic and commercial interests by continuing to exercise post-colonial influence through african rulers . although francafrique policy also meant supporting development in chad , togo and other french-speaking african nations , aid money often disappeared into the coffers of repressive dictators and their military backers , supporting one of the world 's most corrupt regimes and bleeding their impoverished countries dry . antoine glaser , the african affairs editor of the french newsletter " la lettre du continent " said that france 's africa policy is a huge battleship of bad habits that can be neither turned around nor torpedoed overnight .
furthermore , he said , france 's influence over the deby regime is waning . " the reality is that the french have less real influence in central africa than ever before , " said glaser . glaser added that france would have evacuated deby when the rebels stormed the presidential palace 10 days ago , but the chadian president refused the offer and drove the opposition out with government troops .
deby 's intransigency and the strength of the resistance took the french leadership by surprise , said glaser . no political middle ground in chad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france underestimated the deby regime 's resistance to rebel and opposition groups " the french completely underestimated the backing for deby and thought the rebels would overrun the palace , " he said .
" once deby won , france had to decide either to fully support him or not at all .
in chad , there is no middle ground .
you are either in or you are out . " only days before the rebel attack , french defense minister herve morin said that france would maintain " neutrality " in the central african country , which borders the sudanese crisis region of darfur , where refugees have been fleeing ethnic wars . france was even ready to see deby go but was surprised by his tenacity at holding on to power , said alex de waal , a program director specializing in african issues at the social science research council in new york . " now the french government sees no alternative to supporting a despotic dictator , since the opposition is viewed as destabilizing , " said de waal . a european union force , made up largely of french troops and intended to stabilize chad 's eastern border with darfur , however , has been delayed due to rebel violence .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on sunday , feb .
10 , that deployment would be resumed in the next few days . eu allies question french motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france evacuated foreign nationals from chad 's capital at the beginning of february but now that paris has taken deby 's side , france 's european partners , who had already been lukewarm about the operation , are getting cold feet . " the eu would have no choice but to support france , which supports deby , " said de waal .
" peacekeeping is a wonderful principle to protect african civilians , but it only works if the eu commits troops who are willing to fight and get killed . " analysts say that neither the germans nor the british are committing troops to the eu operation , partly because they suspect that france is using the eu umbrella to promote french national interests . the appointment of irishman pat nash as the mission 's commander-in-chief was not enough to convince germany to participate in a conflict dominated by the french , said dirk kohnert , an africa expert at the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg . " the french have an altruistic side , but also a very egotistical side , " said kohnert .
" france wants to be a global player outside of the eu context . " better uses of declining influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say deby offer to pardon french aid workers is tied to france 's political support france also wants to protect its export market in luxury consumer goods targeted at an extravagant african elite and french commercial interests in trading commodities , he added . chad is rich in gold , uranium and in recent years has also tapped reserves that make it an oil-exporting nation , but the french , unlike the american exxonmobil consortium , currently have virtually no oil interests in the region . marielle debos , a chad specialist at france 's elite university sciences po , however , played down the importance of economic ties . " france wants to maintain strategic and military influence in central africa , but there are no truly good reasons for french interventionist policies in central africa , " said debos . she said france could have used its influence to play a more constructive role in chad by promoting national dialogue and addressing the root causes of the current conflict . olivier thimonier , who is a spokesman for survie , a ngo that is lobbying for more democracy and human rights in africa , added that civil opposition leaders , who were unarmed and arrested during the rebellion , should be released . " if france can intervene on behalf of deby , it can also intervene to promote a more open political system , " he said .
" things are quiet in chad at the moment , but there is still unrest and anti-french sentiment below the surface .
over the long term , the solution to conflict must be political engagement , not military suppression . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far . the swiss and austrian organizers of euro 2008 may be taking a page out of germany 's book when it comes to trying to emulate the success of the world cup two years ago , but it seems that the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- itself has forgotten one of its main mistakes from 2006 . while the world cup in germany has been lauded as one of the most successfully organized global soccer events in modern history , one of the few aspects to cause chaos and consternation was the allocation of tickets . the complicated online lottery process , the exorbitant prices , the credit card monopolies and the minute numbers of tickets actually available to the everyday fan were just some of the complaints that dogged the almost-perfect tournament .
two years on , the dfb looks to have forgotten the stress and strain german fans went through to see their team play international soccer . a staggering 1.5 million tickets were requested by germany fans for the 14,400 available for their country 's three euro 2008 pool games in austria , the dfb said on wednesday , feb .
13 .
applications , whcih the dfb called " overwhelming , " closed at midnight on tuesday , leaving fans of joachim loew 's boys were again facing heartbreak . german fans destined for ticket disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niersbach had to try and rob goleo to get a world cup ticket " it seems to be german fans ' mission impossible to get tickets for euro 2008 , " dfb secretary-general wolfgang niersbuch said .
" unfortunately , there will be only a few joyful winners and it is a pity we have so few tickets to give away in a drawing which will take place at the end of the month . " the dfb , he admitted , was only handing over 14,400 of the 21,765 tickets it has to fans . " we also have to give tickets to our committees , the bundesliga clubs , the regional organizations , our sponsors and the players ' families get an allocation too , " niersbuch said . after the success of the 2006 world cup , the demand for germany 's first round matches against poland -lrb- june 8 -rrb- and croatia -lrb- june 12 -rrb- in the southern austrian city of klagenfurt , plus the clash with hosts austria in vienna -lrb- june 16 -rrb- , has gone through the roof . but the dfb can not be held fully responsible for the imminent distress .
some of the venues for the european championships are less than equipped for dealing with fans ' demands than the ticket allocation process itself . for example , germany 's potential group deciding clash against croatia in klagenfurt takes place in the 32,000-capacity hypo group arena , a stadium much smaller than many bundesliga venues . black market preparing for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rival fans may end up together with black market tickets for the two games in klagenfurt , the dfb gets 5,722 tickets per game with 10,321 available for the game against austria at the ernst happel stadium , which has a capacity of 50,000 . the result could see huge numbers of fans descending on the venues ahead of the games willing to part company with large sums of cash for tickets in various areas of the arenas , leading to security issues . with games against bitter rivals poland , notoriously volatile croatia and neighbors austria , placing germany fans in opposition blocks is something the authorities will want to avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 12.02.2008 readers oppose turkish schools in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turks in germany not to give up their ethnicity when turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan visited germany this week , he sparked discussion on integration and took heat for his proposal to start turkish schools in germany .
here 's what some dw readers had to say . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as an american who grew up in a small town with many first generation italian and greek immigrants , i am familiar with the issue of integration .
it was my experience that my contemporaries whose parents came from the " old country " spoke italian or greek at home .
they learned english from the radio , tv , playmates and school .
notwithstanding that they spoke their parents ' language at home and carried on many of the parents ' traditions , their parents encouraged them to learn american culture and to " fit in . "
they did fit in ; no one cared what they spoke at home , and today you would n't know that their parents did n't come over on the mayflower .
integration does not mean you forget where you family came from , it is adapting to where you are . - james fraser , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2.4 million turks make up the largest minority group in germany i think the turkish authorities have to understand what the german authorities are saying because every country has the way they do things .
having schools with a mother tongue in another country is far from the game .
globally , they say when in rome , do like romans , so i think if you are in germany , do like the germans . - victor c. okeke , nigeria erdogan is very much correct .
turkish people should not give up their culture and identity .
he should work to integrate as many back into turkish society as possible . - ed mueller , us the germans are out of their mind if they would allow such schools .
can you imagine germans immigrating to the us and demanding german-speaking schools ?
turks in germany must accept that they are becoming germans and if they do n't want to become germans , let them go to turkey . - peter , new zealand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before erdogan 's visit , nine turks were killed in a fire in ludwigshafen on feb .
3 the turks in germany should learn german .
they chose to live there .
if they get their own schools , they will soon want their own government , their own land , their own country within germany . - andrea weidner , us erdogan 's proposal is not only counterproductive to the goals of integration but it is an obvious indication of the goals of turkey .
turkey is unwilling to create common ground with europe .
they expect europeans to change so as to accommodate turkish demands , culture language , and laws .
it should become obvious that turkey , a nation that will not allow a greek orthodox seminary to reopen , a nation which is based on the tenant " turkey for the turks " and has systematically persecuted its minorities with discriminatory laws , can not be allowed to have a say in the lives of the people of europe . - m. g. ikossi , us i was born turkey but have lived in the us for 48 years .
here , americans complain that spanish-speaking immigrants do not know english .
when you are in the us , you should learn english right away .
if parents do not know the new language and want their children to know their mother language , this is understandable , but these kids are going to live in us -lrb- or germany -rrb- .
they have to compete with germans or americans .
today i see turkish kids in germany who can not speak decent german .
when turks complain that their children can not go to high school and college , what do they expect ?
now erdogan wants germany to have turkish middle schools .
if german does that , i really do not know what to say . - engin sor , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the series continues in poland . klara lives in the old town in warsaw .
she said she is lucky because she lives in an apartment owned by her father , so she avoids paying a mortgage or rent .
it 's a 38 square-meter -lrb- 409 square-foot -rrb- studio apartment in one of the city 's most expensive neighborhoods . klara lives a short walk to the center of the city and a 15-minute walk to the subway station .
she works as the chief editor of a supplement to a national newspaper . monthly income : 8,000 zloty -lrb- 2,210 euros , $ 3,264 -rrb- rent : 360 zloty in management fees -lrb- 100 euros , $ 147 -rrb- monthly utilities : 150 zloty -lrb- 41.45 euros , $ 61.20 -rrb- bus / metro ticket : 2.40 zloty -lrb- 0.66 euros , $ 0.97 -rrb- one liter milk : 2.80 zloty -lrb- 0.77 euros , $ 1.14 -rrb- loaf of bread : 3.00 zloty -lrb- 0.83 euro , $ 1.22 -rrb- one kilogram sugar : 1.50 zloty -lrb- 0.41 euros , $ 0.61 -rrb- domestic stamp : 1.80 zloty -lrb- 0.50 euros , $ 0.73 -rrb- movie ticket : 22 zloty -lrb- 6.00 euros , $ 8.97 -rrb- have you noticed that things have become more expensive recently ? i have on some products , but i 'm not the kind of consumer who would really feel this .
it would not affect me that much .
i can tell that things have become more expensive overall , but not too much ; it 's just the normal kind of inflation process for most products . it 's hard for me to tell because i often have the impression that they randomly make some products more expensive in small shops , the kind of shops where i go .
if a product sells well , for example , and that 's because they know that the people who live here are tied to them so they can afford to lift prices sometimes .
i buy sardines very often and i can see they are popular in this particular shop because they have more and more kinds , and they 're more expensive in a very obvious way .
so we 're talking about a store that can afford to manipulate prices because they 're the only one around here - and it 's difficult to set up a shop in the old town . how easy is it for you to get by ? i earn a rather high wage so i certainly do n't struggle .
but i 'm also lucky because i own an apartment and do n't have to pay a mortgage .
i think most people who are in my income bracket with a steady job will very often be burdened by a mortgage , which might mean they sometimes have problems .
i 'm lucky enough to have this apartment that was given to me by my dad .
i earn well and i have a rather wealthy family .
i might not be the most representative consumer . what about for most people in poland is it easy for them to get by financially ? it depends .
people i know from work who are journalists will probably earn around 6,000 zloty -lrb- 1,658 euros , $ 2,447 -rrb- per month before taxes , and if they have a mortgage , like most of them do , then sometimes they will struggle .
but they do n't struggle to the extent where they ca n't afford to go out and have something to eat in town once a month or have a few drinks .
generally i do n't see them as being handicapped in their leisure time or social life .
of course , they can not afford to go out every night and have meals in restaurants all the time . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? i 'm worried that the finance market crash in the united states will somehow affect the european economy , especially the british economy since it 's a bit more tied up and similar to the american economy .
i 'm afraid that england might take a hit and if england takes a hit then other countries are just as likely to be somehow affected by that . i 'm not sure how poland would react , but the interdependence is so complex that that 's my main worry . for the european economy in general , whatever happens , we will always suffer from everything else that happens in the world .
that 's not big news .
but for me one of the key problems is the lack of workers ' mobility between countries .
that 's really something that puts us behind emerging economies like india and china and the united states , obviously , the fact that we do n't move enough . in saying that , i know how many poles have moved to england recently and i know what kind of effect it has on the british and the polish economies , how positive overall this is .
i 'm sure that there will be people in britain who might not be happy about having this flood of immigrants going there , but i think that it gave a boost to the british economy . it gave a boost to the polish economy , because , first of all , the unemployment rate fell and , secondly , because people often send money back home .
when they come back those people would have benefitted enormously , because just being in another culture , to see the know-how , they would have learnt the language , they might have established economic ties with britain .
i think that if there were more movements like that within europe it would certainly benefit everybody . nb .

if a product sells well , for example , and that 's because they know that the people who live here are tied to them so they can afford to lift prices sometimes .
i buy sardines very often and i can see they are popular in this particular shop because they have more and more kinds , and they 're more expensive in a very obvious way .
so we 're talking about a store that can afford to manipulate prices because they 're the only one around here - and it 's difficult to set up a shop in the old town . how easy is it for you to get by ? i earn a rather high wage so i certainly do n't struggle .
but i 'm also lucky because i own an apartment and do n't have to pay a mortgage .
i think most people who are in my income bracket with a steady job will very often be burdened by a mortgage , which might mean they sometimes have problems .
i 'm lucky enough to have this apartment that was given to me by my dad .
i earn well and i have a rather wealthy family .
i might not be the most representative consumer . what about for most people in poland is it easy for them to get by financially ? it depends .
people i know from work who are journalists will probably earn around 6,000 zloty -lrb- 1,658 euros , $ 2,447 -rrb- per month before taxes , and if they have a mortgage , like most of them do , then sometimes they will struggle .
but they do n't struggle to the extent where they ca n't afford to go out and have something to eat in town once a month or have a few drinks .
generally i do n't see them as being handicapped in their leisure time or social life .
of course , they can not afford to go out every night and have meals in restaurants all the time . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? i 'm worried that the finance market crash in the united states will somehow affect the european economy , especially the british economy since it 's a bit more tied up and similar to the american economy .
i 'm afraid that england might take a hit and if england takes a hit then other countries are just as likely to be somehow affected by that . i 'm not sure how poland would react , but the interdependence is so complex that that 's my main worry . for the european economy in general , whatever happens , we will always suffer from everything else that happens in the world .
that 's not big news .
but for me one of the key problems is the lack of workers ' mobility between countries .
that 's really something that puts us behind emerging economies like india and china and the united states , obviously , the fact that we do n't move enough . in saying that , i know how many poles have moved to england recently and i know what kind of effect it has on the british and the polish economies , how positive overall this is .
i 'm sure that there will be people in britain who might not be happy about having this flood of immigrants going there , but i think that it gave a boost to the british economy . it gave a boost to the polish economy , because , first of all , the unemployment rate fell and , secondly , because people often send money back home .
when they come back those people would have benefitted enormously , because just being in another culture , to see the know-how , they would have learnt the language , they might have established economic ties with britain .
i think that if there were more movements like that within europe it would certainly benefit everybody . nb .

it was my experience that my contemporaries whose parents came from the " old country " spoke italian or greek at home .
they learned english from the radio , tv , playmates and school .
notwithstanding that they spoke their parents ' language at home and carried on many of the parents ' traditions , their parents encouraged them to learn american culture and to " fit in . "
they did fit in ; no one cared what they spoke at home , and today you would n't know that their parents did n't come over on the mayflower .

turkey is unwilling to create common ground with europe .
they expect europeans to change so as to accommodate turkish demands , culture language , and laws .
it should become obvious that turkey , a nation that will not allow a greek orthodox seminary to reopen , a nation which is based on the tenant " turkey for the turks " and has systematically persecuted its minorities with discriminatory laws , can not be allowed to have a say in the lives of the people of europe . - m. g. ikossi , us i was born turkey but have lived in the us for 48 years .

in return , russia said it would not make good on its threat to cut off gas supplies to ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal averted a major international incident ukraine receives about one quarter of its natural gas from russia .
the rest comes from central asia but passes through pipelines on russian territory .
russian gas , in turn , is often transported through ukraine to other countries . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs welcomed the deal as the basis to resolve future disputes .
most russian gas exports pass across ukrainian territory but both countries have assured europe that westward gas flows will not be interrupted . " the commission expects that this solution will establish the basis for a stable and solid bilateral energy relationship , " piebalgs said in a statement . disagreement remains over the extent of the debt .
moscow says it is owed 975 million euros -lrb- $ 1.45 billion -rrb- , while the ukrainian government says it is only 735 million euros in the red . russia and ukraine have repeatedly squabbled over gas prices and supplies since ukraine 's orange revolution of 2004 , but now the two sides agreed to form a working group to negotiate over future issues concerning the trade in and transport of natural gas . retargeting russian missiles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is strongly opposed to us plans for a missile defense system in eastern europe putin and yushchenko agreed to fix the price of russian gas for ukraine at 123 euros per 1,000 cubic meter for the remainder of this year . but lest anyone have thought the tension between the two uneasy neighbors was over , putin had a warning for ukraine about that country 's relationship with the western military alliance nato . kyiv hopes nato will approve a membership action plan for ukraine - a formal step towards membership - at the alliance 's bucharest summit in april .
moscow , however , views the expansion of nato as a threat to russian security . should kyiv allow nato missiles to be stationed in ukraine , putin told journalists , " russia would have no choice but to re-aim its -lsb- nuclear -rsb- warheads at ukrainian territory . " " i draw your attention to the consequences that would follow , " putin said .
" it is terrible to even think that in response to this .
russia can not theoretically exclude aiming our offensive missile systems at ukraine . " russia has fiercely rejected us plans to establish a missile defense shield in europe - with parts of the system being located in poland and the czech republic , both former russian allies from the soviet era . yushchenko defended his country 's right to maintain an independent foreign and defense policy .
but he said the ukrainian constitution prohibited foreign troops from being stationed within the country . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world bank hopes the country would be able to support itself through its coal deposits .
some economists are not convinced it will be that easy . it could all happen on february 17 .
observers are expecting kosovo to declare its independence on sunday .
independence will give the albanian majority what it has been dreaming of : secession from serbia .
however , behind all the hope and optimism which stirs in the province ahead of the declaration there is still some uncertainty over whether kosovo - known during the cold war as " yugoslavia 's poorhouse " - will be able to support itself economically as a new nation state .
even today , kosovo rates as one of the poorest regions in europe .
according to the world bank , the average annual salary for the population is 1,243 euros -lrb- $ 1,803 -rrb- .
it reports that 37 percent of the population lives in poverty and survives on less than 1.42 euros a day .

poverty-stricken province ignoring realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the optimism is tempered by skepticism how can such a country survive economically ?
the skepticism increases in relation to the anticipation of imminent independence .
" the secessionists ignore the economic realities , " ruth wedgwood , a professor for international law and diplomacy at john hopkins university in baltimore , wrote in a commentary in the wall street journal on feb .
9 .
wedgwood is one of those who see kosovo as having little to gain from independence .
" kosovo has coal , lead and a workforce , but it lies in a corner of europe where only a few tourists ever go , " she wrote .
politically , she added , there is no need for kosovo to pursue independence now that slobodan milosevic is no longer in power .
franz kaps , the world bank 's special envoy to southern europe until may last year , sees things in less pessimistic terms .
now an independent advisor to the bank , kaps believes that it is kosovo 's coal reserves which will help support it through its transition to an independent state and beyond .
electricity demand a lifeline for kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's coal industry could be its economic savior southern europe , the world bank predicts , will need additional electricity of up to 4.5 gigawatts by 2012 .
kosovo sits on an estimated 15 billion tons of coal .
the potential for supply and demand is evident in these forecasted figures , but the state of kosovo 's coal industry will have to improve radically if the new state is to be the main provider of that extra power .
" if this succeeds , kosovo could even become an exporter of electricity , " kaps said .
however , the development of kosovo 's industry can only happen after political and juridical relations are made stable .
" the most important stabilization factor would be that kosovo and serbia are brought into the eu , " he added .
until kosovo gets on its feet , the country would have to rely on help from outside its new borders .
the money which flows in from kosovars in other countries is a main source of income to the province .
according to estimates , about 450 million euros per year comes in from the kosovar diaspora .
" this is the source of kosovo 's traditional economic aid , " said karl kaser , a professor for southeast-european history at the university of graz in austria .
donations and eu support could be key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo : cash donations accepted kaser can remember a time when this flow of money was even greater .
in the early 1980s , he visited the region and reported on a flow of cash coming from the north of yugoslavia to the south .
" at that time , one had the feeling that everything was improving , " said kaser .
“ everywhere there were new houses and hotels being built .
but then , in 1989 , the political problems began . "
kaser believes it will be impossible for kosovo to remain part of serbia .
a large part of kosovo 's population wants independence .
but with independence , the new country can forget about any help from belgrade .
" serbia has made it clear that it will not invest in an independent kosovo , " said kaser .
kosovo 's economic future lies with the eu and the creation of a stable government , he added .
for kosovo to develop a coal industry capable of sustaining the new country , it would need to attract foreign investors .
however , kaser fears that any investors would be in it for a fast buck and that any profits would soon be taken out of the country .
despite the uncertainty and obvious hard times ahead , kaser looks forward with optimism , and with no small amount of gallows humor , to an independent kosovo .

are executives ' earnings obscene excess or legitimate incentive ?
a small-business owner in switzerland -lrb- known for being pro-business -rrb- is pushing through a referendum that would lop off the superfluous zeros . thomas minder gets a bit angry when he talks about severance packages and bonuses for managers . " those things come from the us and they 're not normal here in switzerland , " he said .
" this kind of corporate policy is sick and has to be changed . " minder , a small business owner from neuhausen am rheinfall in switzerland , has launched an initiative against exorbitant salaries for managers .
he says it 's unjust that some executives earn 600 times more than an average worker - and are even rewarded with seven-digit severance payments when they do a poor job and are dismissed . after a year and a half of campaigning , minder has nearly collected the 100,000 signatures that are necessary in switzerland for a referendum .
he and the signatories want the government to put an end to disproportionate executive salaries . salt in the wound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minder was hit hard when swiss air went bankrupt the reason behind minder 's efforts is personal .
about six years ago , swiss air placed a large order for hand lotion , lip balm and tooth paste with his small cosmetic company .
when the airline declared bankruptcy shortly thereafter , minder 's firm was stuck with a pile of toiletries and an unpaid bill . " when it came out a few months later that the ceo had gotten a settlement worth 12.5 million francs -lrb- 7.8 million euros , $ 11.4 million -rrb- , the world collapsed for us , " said minder . his campaign has hit a nerve with the swiss .
manager salaries in switzerland continue to rise disproportionately to workers ' wages - just like in germany , where the debate heated up several weeks ago . according to the investment management fund ethos , executive earnings at switzerland 's 20 largest companies rose 17 percent from 2005 to 2006 .
workers ' wages , on the other hand , only increased by 2.5 percent at most . unusual , but not unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is a direct democracy the discrepancy upsets a lot of people , said political scientist thomas milic from the university of zurich . milic , whose research focuses on public referenda , said that milic 's referendum has a chance , even though statistics suggest the contrary .
of the 200 or so petitions for referenda that have come from the swiss populace , only 15 have gone through , he said . once the 100,000 required signatures have been collected , the parliament has to put it to a public vote within three years , according to swiss law .
milic warned , though , that the government tends to water down the laws before they are voted on and present them side-by-side with counter-proposals . however , minder has the politicians on his side , too .
the social democrats , the green party and a leftist splinter party are behind his initiative ; only the right-wing swiss people 's party has n't yet taken a position . stockholders to take charge if minder 's demands are taken on by the electorate , companies listed on swiss stock exchange would have to make some changes .
the initiative calls for banning termination pay , advances and bonuses for selling or buying a company . what 's more , stockholders would determine executives ' salaries , not executives themselves .
minder aims to protect the company owners from the " boundless greed " of its executives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the chances are good for minder 's initiative still , he does n't see himself as a socialist crusader .
" i think civically and very liberally , " he said .
" the proposal is quite business friendly . " pressure from market-minded swiss wolf linder , a political scientist at the university of berne , said he did n't think minder 's proposal was business-friendly enough . " the swiss think in a much more economically liberal way than the germans , " he said .
even if it comes to a referendum , the people wo n't approve the bill , he added . still , the swiss are clearly concerned about the issue .

manager salaries in switzerland continue to rise disproportionately to workers ' wages - just like in germany , where the debate heated up several weeks ago . according to the investment management fund ethos , executive earnings at switzerland 's 20 largest companies rose 17 percent from 2005 to 2006 .
workers ' wages , on the other hand , only increased by 2.5 percent at most . unusual , but not unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is a direct democracy the discrepancy upsets a lot of people , said political scientist thomas milic from the university of zurich . milic , whose research focuses on public referenda , said that milic 's referendum has a chance , even though statistics suggest the contrary .
of the 200 or so petitions for referenda that have come from the swiss populace , only 15 have gone through , he said . once the 100,000 required signatures have been collected , the parliament has to put it to a public vote within three years , according to swiss law .
milic warned , though , that the government tends to water down the laws before they are voted on and present them side-by-side with counter-proposals . however , minder has the politicians on his side , too .
the social democrats , the green party and a leftist splinter party are behind his initiative ; only the right-wing swiss people 's party has n't yet taken a position . stockholders to take charge if minder 's demands are taken on by the electorate , companies listed on swiss stock exchange would have to make some changes .
the initiative calls for banning termination pay , advances and bonuses for selling or buying a company . what 's more , stockholders would determine executives ' salaries , not executives themselves .
minder aims to protect the company owners from the " boundless greed " of its executives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the chances are good for minder 's initiative still , he does n't see himself as a socialist crusader .
" i think civically and very liberally , " he said .
" the proposal is quite business friendly . " pressure from market-minded swiss wolf linder , a political scientist at the university of berne , said he did n't think minder 's proposal was business-friendly enough . " the swiss think in a much more economically liberal way than the germans , " he said .
even if it comes to a referendum , the people wo n't approve the bill , he added . still , the swiss are clearly concerned about the issue .

are executives ' earnings obscene excess or legitimate incentive ?
a small-business owner in switzerland -lrb- known for being pro-business -rrb- is pushing through a referendum that would lop off the superfluous zeros . thomas minder gets a bit angry when he talks about severance packages and bonuses for managers . " those things come from the us and they 're not normal here in switzerland , " he said .
" this kind of corporate policy is sick and has to be changed . " minder , a small business owner from neuhausen am rheinfall in switzerland , has launched an initiative against exorbitant salaries for managers .
he says it 's unjust that some executives earn 600 times more than an average worker - and are even rewarded with seven-digit severance payments when they do a poor job and are dismissed . after a year and a half of campaigning , minder has nearly collected the 100,000 signatures that are necessary in switzerland for a referendum .
he and the signatories want the government to put an end to disproportionate executive salaries . salt in the wound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minder was hit hard when swiss air went bankrupt the reason behind minder 's efforts is personal .
about six years ago , swiss air placed a large order for hand lotion , lip balm and tooth paste with his small cosmetic company .
when the airline declared bankruptcy shortly thereafter , minder 's firm was stuck with a pile of toiletries and an unpaid bill . " when it came out a few months later that the ceo had gotten a settlement worth 12.5 million francs -lrb- 7.8 million euros , $ 11.4 million -rrb- , the world collapsed for us , " said minder . his campaign has hit a nerve with the swiss .
manager salaries in switzerland continue to rise disproportionately to workers ' wages - just like in germany , where the debate heated up several weeks ago . according to the investment management fund ethos , executive earnings at switzerland 's 20 largest companies rose 17 percent from 2005 to 2006 .
workers ' wages , on the other hand , only increased by 2.5 percent at most . unusual , but not unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is a direct democracy the discrepancy upsets a lot of people , said political scientist thomas milic from the university of zurich . milic , whose research focuses on public referenda , said that milic 's referendum has a chance , even though statistics suggest the contrary .
of the 200 or so petitions for referenda that have come from the swiss populace , only 15 have gone through , he said . once the 100,000 required signatures have been collected , the parliament has to put it to a public vote within three years , according to swiss law .
milic warned , though , that the government tends to water down the laws before they are voted on and present them side-by-side with counter-proposals . however , minder has the politicians on his side , too .
the social democrats , the green party and a leftist splinter party are behind his initiative ; only the right-wing swiss people 's party has n't yet taken a position . stockholders to take charge if minder 's demands are taken on by the electorate , companies listed on swiss stock exchange would have to make some changes .
the initiative calls for banning termination pay , advances and bonuses for selling or buying a company . what 's more , stockholders would determine executives ' salaries , not executives themselves .
minder aims to protect the company owners from the " boundless greed " of its executives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the chances are good for minder 's initiative still , he does n't see himself as a socialist crusader .
" i think civically and very liberally , " he said .
" the proposal is quite business friendly . " pressure from market-minded swiss wolf linder , a political scientist at the university of berne , said he did n't think minder 's proposal was business-friendly enough . " the swiss think in a much more economically liberal way than the germans , " he said .
even if it comes to a referendum , the people wo n't approve the bill , he added . still , the swiss are clearly concerned about the issue .

the world bank hopes the country would be able to support itself through its coal deposits .
some economists are not convinced it will be that easy . it could all happen on february 17 .
observers are expecting kosovo to declare its independence on sunday .
independence will give the albanian majority what it has been dreaming of : secession from serbia .
however , behind all the hope and optimism which stirs in the province ahead of the declaration there is still some uncertainty over whether kosovo - known during the cold war as " yugoslavia 's poorhouse " - will be able to support itself economically as a new nation state .
even today , kosovo rates as one of the poorest regions in europe .
according to the world bank , the average annual salary for the population is 1,243 euros -lrb- $ 1,803 -rrb- .
it reports that 37 percent of the population lives in poverty and survives on less than 1.42 euros a day .
those who suffer the most are the most vulnerable : the children , old people , families without male breadwinners , the disabled , the unemployed , and the non-serbian ethnic minorities like the roma .
poverty-stricken province ignoring realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the optimism is tempered by skepticism how can such a country survive economically ?
the skepticism increases in relation to the anticipation of imminent independence .
" the secessionists ignore the economic realities , " ruth wedgwood , a professor for international law and diplomacy at john hopkins university in baltimore , wrote in a commentary in the wall street journal on feb .
9 .
wedgwood is one of those who see kosovo as having little to gain from independence .
" kosovo has coal , lead and a workforce , but it lies in a corner of europe where only a few tourists ever go , " she wrote .
politically , she added , there is no need for kosovo to pursue independence now that slobodan milosevic is no longer in power .
franz kaps , the world bank 's special envoy to southern europe until may last year , sees things in less pessimistic terms .
now an independent advisor to the bank , kaps believes that it is kosovo 's coal reserves which will help support it through its transition to an independent state and beyond .
electricity demand a lifeline for kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's coal industry could be its economic savior southern europe , the world bank predicts , will need additional electricity of up to 4.5 gigawatts by 2012 .
kosovo sits on an estimated 15 billion tons of coal .
the potential for supply and demand is evident in these forecasted figures , but the state of kosovo 's coal industry will have to improve radically if the new state is to be the main provider of that extra power .
" if this succeeds , kosovo could even become an exporter of electricity , " kaps said .
however , the development of kosovo 's industry can only happen after political and juridical relations are made stable .
" the most important stabilization factor would be that kosovo and serbia are brought into the eu , " he added .
until kosovo gets on its feet , the country would have to rely on help from outside its new borders .
the money which flows in from kosovars in other countries is a main source of income to the province .
according to estimates , about 450 million euros per year comes in from the kosovar diaspora .
" this is the source of kosovo 's traditional economic aid , " said karl kaser , a professor for southeast-european history at the university of graz in austria .
donations and eu support could be key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo : cash donations accepted kaser can remember a time when this flow of money was even greater .
in the early 1980s , he visited the region and reported on a flow of cash coming from the north of yugoslavia to the south .
" at that time , one had the feeling that everything was improving , " said kaser .
“ everywhere there were new houses and hotels being built .
but then , in 1989 , the political problems began . "
kaser believes it will be impossible for kosovo to remain part of serbia .
a large part of kosovo 's population wants independence .
but with independence , the new country can forget about any help from belgrade .
" serbia has made it clear that it will not invest in an independent kosovo , " said kaser .
kosovo 's economic future lies with the eu and the creation of a stable government , he added .
for kosovo to develop a coal industry capable of sustaining the new country , it would need to attract foreign investors .
however , kaser fears that any investors would be in it for a fast buck and that any profits would soon be taken out of the country .
despite the uncertainty and obvious hard times ahead , kaser looks forward with optimism , and with no small amount of gallows humor , to an independent kosovo .

the world bank hopes the country would be able to support itself through its coal deposits .
some economists are not convinced it will be that easy . it could all happen on february 17 .
observers are expecting kosovo to declare its independence on sunday .
independence will give the albanian majority what it has been dreaming of : secession from serbia .
however , behind all the hope and optimism which stirs in the province ahead of the declaration there is still some uncertainty over whether kosovo - known during the cold war as " yugoslavia 's poorhouse " - will be able to support itself economically as a new nation state .
even today , kosovo rates as one of the poorest regions in europe .
according to the world bank , the average annual salary for the population is 1,243 euros -lrb- $ 1,803 -rrb- .
it reports that 37 percent of the population lives in poverty and survives on less than 1.42 euros a day .
those who suffer the most are the most vulnerable : the children , old people , families without male breadwinners , the disabled , the unemployed , and the non-serbian ethnic minorities like the roma .
poverty-stricken province ignoring realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the optimism is tempered by skepticism how can such a country survive economically ?
the skepticism increases in relation to the anticipation of imminent independence .
" the secessionists ignore the economic realities , " ruth wedgwood , a professor for international law and diplomacy at john hopkins university in baltimore , wrote in a commentary in the wall street journal on feb .
9 .
wedgwood is one of those who see kosovo as having little to gain from independence .
" kosovo has coal , lead and a workforce , but it lies in a corner of europe where only a few tourists ever go , " she wrote .
politically , she added , there is no need for kosovo to pursue independence now that slobodan milosevic is no longer in power .
franz kaps , the world bank 's special envoy to southern europe until may last year , sees things in less pessimistic terms .
now an independent advisor to the bank , kaps believes that it is kosovo 's coal reserves which will help support it through its transition to an independent state and beyond .
electricity demand a lifeline for kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's coal industry could be its economic savior southern europe , the world bank predicts , will need additional electricity of up to 4.5 gigawatts by 2012 .
kosovo sits on an estimated 15 billion tons of coal .
the potential for supply and demand is evident in these forecasted figures , but the state of kosovo 's coal industry will have to improve radically if the new state is to be the main provider of that extra power .
" if this succeeds , kosovo could even become an exporter of electricity , " kaps said .
however , the development of kosovo 's industry can only happen after political and juridical relations are made stable .
" the most important stabilization factor would be that kosovo and serbia are brought into the eu , " he added .
until kosovo gets on its feet , the country would have to rely on help from outside its new borders .
the money which flows in from kosovars in other countries is a main source of income to the province .
according to estimates , about 450 million euros per year comes in from the kosovar diaspora .
" this is the source of kosovo 's traditional economic aid , " said karl kaser , a professor for southeast-european history at the university of graz in austria .
donations and eu support could be key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo : cash donations accepted kaser can remember a time when this flow of money was even greater .
in the early 1980s , he visited the region and reported on a flow of cash coming from the north of yugoslavia to the south .
" at that time , one had the feeling that everything was improving , " said kaser .
“ everywhere there were new houses and hotels being built .
but then , in 1989 , the political problems began . "
kaser believes it will be impossible for kosovo to remain part of serbia .
a large part of kosovo 's population wants independence .
but with independence , the new country can forget about any help from belgrade .
" serbia has made it clear that it will not invest in an independent kosovo , " said kaser .
kosovo 's economic future lies with the eu and the creation of a stable government , he added .
for kosovo to develop a coal industry capable of sustaining the new country , it would need to attract foreign investors .
however , kaser fears that any investors would be in it for a fast buck and that any profits would soon be taken out of the country .
despite the uncertainty and obvious hard times ahead , kaser looks forward with optimism , and with no small amount of gallows humor , to an independent kosovo .

furthermore , he said , france 's influence over the deby regime is waning . " the reality is that the french have less real influence in central africa than ever before , " said glaser . glaser added that france would have evacuated deby when the rebels stormed the presidential palace 10 days ago , but the chadian president refused the offer and drove the opposition out with government troops .
deby 's intransigency and the strength of the resistance took the french leadership by surprise , said glaser . no political middle ground in chad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france underestimated the deby regime 's resistance to rebel and opposition groups " the french completely underestimated the backing for deby and thought the rebels would overrun the palace , " he said .
" once deby won , france had to decide either to fully support him or not at all .
in chad , there is no middle ground .
you are either in or you are out . " only days before the rebel attack , french defense minister herve morin said that france would maintain " neutrality " in the central african country , which borders the sudanese crisis region of darfur , where refugees have been fleeing ethnic wars . france was even ready to see deby go but was surprised by his tenacity at holding on to power , said alex de waal , a program director specializing in african issues at the social science research council in new york . " now the french government sees no alternative to supporting a despotic dictator , since the opposition is viewed as destabilizing , " said de waal . a european union force , made up largely of french troops and intended to stabilize chad 's eastern border with darfur , however , has been delayed due to rebel violence .

" the eu would have no choice but to support france , which supports deby , " said de waal .
" peacekeeping is a wonderful principle to protect african civilians , but it only works if the eu commits troops who are willing to fight and get killed .

" france wants to be a global player outside of the eu context . " better uses of declining influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say deby offer to pardon french aid workers is tied to france 's political support france also wants to protect its export market in luxury consumer goods targeted at an extravagant african elite and french commercial interests in trading commodities , he added . chad is rich in gold , uranium and in recent years has also tapped reserves that make it an oil-exporting nation , but the french , unlike the american exxonmobil consortium , currently have virtually no oil interests in the region . marielle debos , a chad specialist at france 's elite university sciences po , however , played down the importance of economic ties . " france wants to maintain strategic and military influence in central africa , but there are no truly good reasons for french interventionist policies in central africa , " said debos . she said france could have used its influence to play a more constructive role in chad by promoting national dialogue and addressing the root causes of the current conflict . olivier thimonier , who is a spokesman for survie , a ngo that is lobbying for more democracy and human rights in africa , added that civil opposition leaders , who were unarmed and arrested during the rebellion , should be released . " if france can intervene on behalf of deby , it can also intervene to promote a more open political system , " he said .

" better uses of declining influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say deby offer to pardon french aid workers is tied to france 's political support france also wants to protect its export market in luxury consumer goods targeted at an extravagant african elite and french commercial interests in trading commodities , he added . chad is rich in gold , uranium and in recent years has also tapped reserves that make it an oil-exporting nation , but the french , unlike the american exxonmobil consortium , currently have virtually no oil interests in the region . marielle debos , a chad specialist at france 's elite university sciences po , however , played down the importance of economic ties . " france wants to maintain strategic and military influence in central africa , but there are no truly good reasons for french interventionist policies in central africa , " said debos . she said france could have used its influence to play a more constructive role in chad by promoting national dialogue and addressing the root causes of the current conflict . olivier thimonier , who is a spokesman for survie , a ngo that is lobbying for more democracy and human rights in africa , added that civil opposition leaders , who were unarmed and arrested during the rebellion , should be released . " if france can intervene on behalf of deby , it can also intervene to promote a more open political system , " he said .
" things are quiet in chad at the moment , but there is still unrest and anti-french sentiment below the surface .
over the long term , the solution to conflict must be political engagement , not military suppression . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

olmert also brushed aside suggestions that iran was no longer a danger after a us intelligence report in december found that tehran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
the israeli prime minister referred to iran 's continued pursuit of uranium enrichment as justification for his country 's belief that iran was receiving nuclear fuel from russia for something other than a civilian nuclear program .

" we are certain the iranians are engaged in serious clandestine operations to build an unconventional weapon , " he said .
olmert also brushed aside suggestions that iran was no longer a danger after a us intelligence report in december found that tehran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
the israeli prime minister referred to iran 's continued pursuit of uranium enrichment as justification for his country 's belief that iran was receiving nuclear fuel from russia for something other than a civilian nuclear program .
olmert said there could be no other reason for iran 's activities .
" the iranians are moving forward with their plans to create a capacity for non-conventional weapons .
there is evidence that the plan of the iranians is not that naive and innocent , " olmert said .
" this is a main challenge .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reiterated her diplomatic stance to olmert germany , along with the five permanent members of the un security council , was currently working on the text of a third resolution on iran , she noted .
olmert also spoke of the palestinian situation , saying that israel faced a " very unusual situation " in attempting to conduct negotiations while at the same time coming under attack , not only from gaza but from other parts of the palestinian territories .
the prime minister did , however , vow to fight terrorism from hamas-controlled gaza " in every possible manner " but refused to directly comment on statements made by israeli defense minister ehud barak , who indicated monday that israel might try to overthrow the hamas regime .
gaza-based terrorism " the israeli government under my leadership is absolutely determined to respond to the challenge of terrorism from gaza in every possible manner which will be effective , " olmert said at the press conference .

in a veiled reference to barak 's statements , olmert said : " i know that there are lots of speculations ... discussions ... suggestions and propositions everywhere of what we can do exactly , " he added .
" that , i 'm afraid , i will not share with you . "
at the same time , he said israel " will continue our negotiations with the palestinian authority " under west bank-based president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad .

but the debate over whether scientology is a sect or a genuine religion is sure to continue . an administrative appellate court in muenster handed down the verdict in the case , brought by the scientology organization , which challenged an early decision allowing government surveillance . the muenster judges found that the federal office for the protection of the constitution was within its authority to keep scientologists under observation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of a new scientology center in berlin last year stirred controversy in the statement announcing the verdict , the court said that there were " numerous indications " that the scientology organization promoted a form of society " in which central constitutional values such as the dignity of mankind and the right to equal treatment would be suspended or restricted . " " in particular , there is the suspicion that in a scientological society only scientologists would enjoy civil rights , " the court decided . the office for the protection of the constitution , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , has had scientology under surveillance since 1997 . misunderstood faith or public hazard ? the organization itself argued that it is a religious association that does not pursue political goals in the sense of the laws established to protect germany 's constitution . but the court rejected the argument , deeming it irrelevant to a case for or against surveillance . germany officially considers scientology a business rather than a religion .
no charges have ever been brought as a result of government surveillance . nonetheless , the court said the scientology movement was " trying to expand personally and to spread scientological principles more and more within government , the economy and society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor tom cruise is one of the movement 's most prominent members scientology was set up by author l. ron hubbard in 1954 in the united states .
the organization 's official web site describes its aims as seeking " only evolution to higher states of being for the individual and for society . " the german court also heard testimony concerning a number of anti-democratic remarks made by hubbard .
the court found that no evidence of the movement distancing itself from those opinions . the church of scientology says it will appeal the ruling and called for an end to the surveillance . " the german federal office for the protection of the constitution should finally end this farce and turn its attention to real enemies of the constitution and real danger so as to do what it is there for : to protect the german constitution and the basic rights of the people , " the organization said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

massive numbers of germany fans have been clamoring for euro 2008 tickets since the lottery process started in earnest .
unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far . the swiss and austrian organizers of euro 2008 may be taking a page out of germany 's book when it comes to trying to emulate the success of the world cup two years ago , but it seems that the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- itself has forgotten one of its main mistakes from 2006 . while the world cup in germany has been lauded as one of the most successfully organized global soccer events in modern history , one of the few aspects to cause chaos and consternation was the allocation of tickets . the complicated online lottery process , the exorbitant prices , the credit card monopolies and the minute numbers of tickets actually available to the everyday fan were just some of the complaints that dogged the almost-perfect tournament .
two years on , the dfb looks to have forgotten the stress and strain german fans went through to see their team play international soccer . a staggering 1.5 million tickets were requested by germany fans for the 14,400 available for their country 's three euro 2008 pool games in austria , the dfb said on wednesday , feb .

applications , whcih the dfb called " overwhelming , " closed at midnight on tuesday , leaving fans of joachim loew 's boys were again facing heartbreak . german fans destined for ticket disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niersbach had to try and rob goleo to get a world cup ticket " it seems to be german fans ' mission impossible to get tickets for euro 2008 , " dfb secretary-general wolfgang niersbuch said .
" unfortunately , there will be only a few joyful winners and it is a pity we have so few tickets to give away in a drawing which will take place at the end of the month . " the dfb , he admitted , was only handing over 14,400 of the 21,765 tickets it has to fans . " we also have to give tickets to our committees , the bundesliga clubs , the regional organizations , our sponsors and the players ' families get an allocation too , " niersbuch said . after the success of the 2006 world cup , the demand for germany 's first round matches against poland -lrb- june 8 -rrb- and croatia -lrb- june 12 -rrb- in the southern austrian city of klagenfurt , plus the clash with hosts austria in vienna -lrb- june 16 -rrb- , has gone through the roof . but the dfb can not be held fully responsible for the imminent distress .
some of the venues for the european championships are less than equipped for dealing with fans ' demands than the ticket allocation process itself . for example , germany 's potential group deciding clash against croatia in klagenfurt takes place in the 32,000-capacity hypo group arena , a stadium much smaller than many bundesliga venues . black market preparing for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rival fans may end up together with black market tickets for the two games in klagenfurt , the dfb gets 5,722 tickets per game with 10,321 available for the game against austria at the ernst happel stadium , which has a capacity of 50,000 . the result could see huge numbers of fans descending on the venues ahead of the games willing to part company with large sums of cash for tickets in various areas of the arenas , leading to security issues . with games against bitter rivals poland , notoriously volatile croatia and neighbors austria , placing germany fans in opposition blocks is something the authorities will want to avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs made in germany video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / dw-tv asien : made in germany question of the week -pipe- 12.02.2008 on the subject of investment strategy - how do you make your money work for you ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors are worried and confidence in banks has been shaken .
what do you think ?
are stock markets still a safe place to invest or is it better to put cash in an equity fund ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : arthur k. age : 33 occupation : accountant city / country : kampala , uganda i invest my money in unit trusts which has several portfolios like the money fund , balanaced investment scheme and high yield fund .
this ensures that i get a high return of say between 7-9 % as compared to the bank rates of 6 % p.a.
the unit trust caters for small investors like myself as you do n't need alot of money to make an investment .
besides since unit trust involve alot of many small investors pooling funds together , the impact of the chargers is not felt greatly by one individual as compared to bank accounts were the chargers are borne by the account holder .
in uganda some of the chargers include 15 % withholding tax and the bank service chargers .
incase of unit trusts these charges are shared equally among the investors thus increasing the value of return on investment .
i am also charged about 2.5 % on initial investment but that compared to the many hidden costs bank charged is a fair deal .
the 6 % interest or return banks offer is way below the 9-10 % inflation rate experienced annually in our economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : juan pablo cardona r. age : 32 occupation : production engineer city / country : medellin , colombia regardless if you are a risk-averse investor or a risk lover , i think the best strategy is : - use diversification , mix risk-free with risky investments . - read economical and political news . - use hedging vehicles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohammed a. age : 23 occupation : financial analyst city / country : riyhad , saudi arabia i would put my money on realestate .
in my country it is a very low risk investment as the demand is booming and it gives very good returns .
my other alternative is to invest in a small business like a resturant or so .
investing in shares is very risky and most people loose money because it is difficult to know when to stop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : carolina v. age : 21 occupation : college graduate city / country : bulacan , philippines people are usually invest their savings on several insurance esp. educational , pension , accident , etc .
however , it may be risky and i could never tell whether it is secured and safe or not due to bankruptcy and corruption ...
as my mom told us ever before when my sister planned to have an educational plan for my younger brother who was born 6 years ago .
so , our family decided to keep our savings and incomes deposited in our several bank accounts and one of those accounts is for my brother 's future tuition fees because he will be nearly grade 1 student this june after finishing his kindergarten course .
and for myself ... as long as i 'm still single and family-dependent , if i have already got my very first salary from my very first job -lrb- hoping ... -rrb- , i 'd rather contribute to our family income to support ourselves and the remaining part is for my own personal debts and savings ... even my future use ...
i was planning to study again as i want to pursue a master 's degree ...
now , in my general opinion , money can do anything .
once we have it , we can use it ... we can spend and invest everything such as " paluwagan " -lrb- filipino term for ... some kinda ... investment between friends or relatives -rrb- and having business as my former college professors did 1 1/2 years ago as they sell dimsums and drinks .
it 's better to do it ... but , the most important is to make it sure that this kind of investment should be in a right time and place . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit die woche we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

furthermore , he said , france 's influence over the deby regime is waning . " the reality is that the french have less real influence in central africa than ever before , " said glaser . glaser added that france would have evacuated deby when the rebels stormed the presidential palace 10 days ago , but the chadian president refused the offer and drove the opposition out with government troops .
deby 's intransigency and the strength of the resistance took the french leadership by surprise , said glaser . no political middle ground in chad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france underestimated the deby regime 's resistance to rebel and opposition groups " the french completely underestimated the backing for deby and thought the rebels would overrun the palace , " he said .
" once deby won , france had to decide either to fully support him or not at all .
in chad , there is no middle ground .
you are either in or you are out . " only days before the rebel attack , french defense minister herve morin said that france would maintain " neutrality " in the central african country , which borders the sudanese crisis region of darfur , where refugees have been fleeing ethnic wars . france was even ready to see deby go but was surprised by his tenacity at holding on to power , said alex de waal , a program director specializing in african issues at the social science research council in new york . " now the french government sees no alternative to supporting a despotic dictator , since the opposition is viewed as destabilizing , " said de waal . a european union force , made up largely of french troops and intended to stabilize chad 's eastern border with darfur , however , has been delayed due to rebel violence .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on sunday , feb .
10 , that deployment would be resumed in the next few days . eu allies question french motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france evacuated foreign nationals from chad 's capital at the beginning of february but now that paris has taken deby 's side , france 's european partners , who had already been lukewarm about the operation , are getting cold feet . " the eu would have no choice but to support france , which supports deby , " said de waal .
" peacekeeping is a wonderful principle to protect african civilians , but it only works if the eu commits troops who are willing to fight and get killed . " analysts say that neither the germans nor the british are committing troops to the eu operation , partly because they suspect that france is using the eu umbrella to promote french national interests . the appointment of irishman pat nash as the mission 's commander-in-chief was not enough to convince germany to participate in a conflict dominated by the french , said dirk kohnert , an africa expert at the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg . " the french have an altruistic side , but also a very egotistical side , " said kohnert .
" france wants to be a global player outside of the eu context . " better uses of declining influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say deby offer to pardon french aid workers is tied to france 's political support france also wants to protect its export market in luxury consumer goods targeted at an extravagant african elite and french commercial interests in trading commodities , he added . chad is rich in gold , uranium and in recent years has also tapped reserves that make it an oil-exporting nation , but the french , unlike the american exxonmobil consortium , currently have virtually no oil interests in the region . marielle debos , a chad specialist at france 's elite university sciences po , however , played down the importance of economic ties . " france wants to maintain strategic and military influence in central africa , but there are no truly good reasons for french interventionist policies in central africa , " said debos . she said france could have used its influence to play a more constructive role in chad by promoting national dialogue and addressing the root causes of the current conflict . olivier thimonier , who is a spokesman for survie , a ngo that is lobbying for more democracy and human rights in africa , added that civil opposition leaders , who were unarmed and arrested during the rebellion , should be released . " if france can intervene on behalf of deby , it can also intervene to promote a more open political system , " he said .
" things are quiet in chad at the moment , but there is still unrest and anti-french sentiment below the surface .
over the long term , the solution to conflict must be political engagement , not military suppression . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

massive numbers of germany fans have been clamoring for euro 2008 tickets since the lottery process started in earnest .
unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far . the swiss and austrian organizers of euro 2008 may be taking a page out of germany 's book when it comes to trying to emulate the success of the world cup two years ago , but it seems that the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- itself has forgotten one of its main mistakes from 2006 . while the world cup in germany has been lauded as one of the most successfully organized global soccer events in modern history , one of the few aspects to cause chaos and consternation was the allocation of tickets . the complicated online lottery process , the exorbitant prices , the credit card monopolies and the minute numbers of tickets actually available to the everyday fan were just some of the complaints that dogged the almost-perfect tournament .
two years on , the dfb looks to have forgotten the stress and strain german fans went through to see their team play international soccer . a staggering 1.5 million tickets were requested by germany fans for the 14,400 available for their country 's three euro 2008 pool games in austria , the dfb said on wednesday , feb .
13 .
applications , whcih the dfb called " overwhelming , " closed at midnight on tuesday , leaving fans of joachim loew 's boys were again facing heartbreak . german fans destined for ticket disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niersbach had to try and rob goleo to get a world cup ticket " it seems to be german fans ' mission impossible to get tickets for euro 2008 , " dfb secretary-general wolfgang niersbuch said .
" unfortunately , there will be only a few joyful winners and it is a pity we have so few tickets to give away in a drawing which will take place at the end of the month . " the dfb , he admitted , was only handing over 14,400 of the 21,765 tickets it has to fans . " we also have to give tickets to our committees , the bundesliga clubs , the regional organizations , our sponsors and the players ' families get an allocation too , " niersbuch said . after the success of the 2006 world cup , the demand for germany 's first round matches against poland -lrb- june 8 -rrb- and croatia -lrb- june 12 -rrb- in the southern austrian city of klagenfurt , plus the clash with hosts austria in vienna -lrb- june 16 -rrb- , has gone through the roof . but the dfb can not be held fully responsible for the imminent distress .
some of the venues for the european championships are less than equipped for dealing with fans ' demands than the ticket allocation process itself . for example , germany 's potential group deciding clash against croatia in klagenfurt takes place in the 32,000-capacity hypo group arena , a stadium much smaller than many bundesliga venues . black market preparing for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rival fans may end up together with black market tickets for the two games in klagenfurt , the dfb gets 5,722 tickets per game with 10,321 available for the game against austria at the ernst happel stadium , which has a capacity of 50,000 . the result could see huge numbers of fans descending on the venues ahead of the games willing to part company with large sums of cash for tickets in various areas of the arenas , leading to security issues . with games against bitter rivals poland , notoriously volatile croatia and neighbors austria , placing germany fans in opposition blocks is something the authorities will want to avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far . the swiss and austrian organizers of euro 2008 may be taking a page out of germany 's book when it comes to trying to emulate the success of the world cup two years ago , but it seems that the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- itself has forgotten one of its main mistakes from 2006 . while the world cup in germany has been lauded as one of the most successfully organized global soccer events in modern history , one of the few aspects to cause chaos and consternation was the allocation of tickets . the complicated online lottery process , the exorbitant prices , the credit card monopolies and the minute numbers of tickets actually available to the everyday fan were just some of the complaints that dogged the almost-perfect tournament .
two years on , the dfb looks to have forgotten the stress and strain german fans went through to see their team play international soccer . a staggering 1.5 million tickets were requested by germany fans for the 14,400 available for their country 's three euro 2008 pool games in austria , the dfb said on wednesday , feb .
13 .
applications , whcih the dfb called " overwhelming , " closed at midnight on tuesday , leaving fans of joachim loew 's boys were again facing heartbreak . german fans destined for ticket disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niersbach had to try and rob goleo to get a world cup ticket " it seems to be german fans ' mission impossible to get tickets for euro 2008 , " dfb secretary-general wolfgang niersbuch said .
" unfortunately , there will be only a few joyful winners and it is a pity we have so few tickets to give away in a drawing which will take place at the end of the month . " the dfb , he admitted , was only handing over 14,400 of the 21,765 tickets it has to fans . " we also have to give tickets to our committees , the bundesliga clubs , the regional organizations , our sponsors and the players ' families get an allocation too , " niersbuch said . after the success of the 2006 world cup , the demand for germany 's first round matches against poland -lrb- june 8 -rrb- and croatia -lrb- june 12 -rrb- in the southern austrian city of klagenfurt , plus the clash with hosts austria in vienna -lrb- june 16 -rrb- , has gone through the roof . but the dfb can not be held fully responsible for the imminent distress .
some of the venues for the european championships are less than equipped for dealing with fans ' demands than the ticket allocation process itself . for example , germany 's potential group deciding clash against croatia in klagenfurt takes place in the 32,000-capacity hypo group arena , a stadium much smaller than many bundesliga venues . black market preparing for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rival fans may end up together with black market tickets for the two games in klagenfurt , the dfb gets 5,722 tickets per game with 10,321 available for the game against austria at the ernst happel stadium , which has a capacity of 50,000 . the result could see huge numbers of fans descending on the venues ahead of the games willing to part company with large sums of cash for tickets in various areas of the arenas , leading to security issues . with games against bitter rivals poland , notoriously volatile croatia and neighbors austria , placing germany fans in opposition blocks is something the authorities will want to avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

furthermore , he said , france 's influence over the deby regime is waning .

in chad , there is no middle ground .
you are either in or you are out .

" now the french government sees no alternative to supporting a despotic dictator , since the opposition is viewed as destabilizing , " said de waal . a european union force , made up largely of french troops and intended to stabilize chad 's eastern border with darfur , however , has been delayed due to rebel violence .

olmert also brushed aside suggestions that iran was no longer a danger after a us intelligence report in december found that tehran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
the israeli prime minister referred to iran 's continued pursuit of uranium enrichment as justification for his country 's belief that iran was receiving nuclear fuel from russia for something other than a civilian nuclear program .
olmert said there could be no other reason for iran 's activities .
" the iranians are moving forward with their plans to create a capacity for non-conventional weapons .

here 's what some dw readers had to say . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as an american who grew up in a small town with many first generation italian and greek immigrants , i am familiar with the issue of integration .
it was my experience that my contemporaries whose parents came from the " old country " spoke italian or greek at home .
they learned english from the radio , tv , playmates and school .
notwithstanding that they spoke their parents ' language at home and carried on many of the parents ' traditions , their parents encouraged them to learn american culture and to " fit in . "
they did fit in ; no one cared what they spoke at home , and today you would n't know that their parents did n't come over on the mayflower .
integration does not mean you forget where you family came from , it is adapting to where you are . - james fraser , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2.4 million turks make up the largest minority group in germany i think the turkish authorities have to understand what the german authorities are saying because every country has the way they do things .
having schools with a mother tongue in another country is far from the game .
globally , they say when in rome , do like romans , so i think if you are in germany , do like the germans . - victor c. okeke , nigeria erdogan is very much correct .
turkish people should not give up their culture and identity .
he should work to integrate as many back into turkish society as possible . - ed mueller , us the germans are out of their mind if they would allow such schools .
can you imagine germans immigrating to the us and demanding german-speaking schools ?
turks in germany must accept that they are becoming germans and if they do n't want to become germans , let them go to turkey . - peter , new zealand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before erdogan 's visit , nine turks were killed in a fire in ludwigshafen on feb .
3 the turks in germany should learn german .
they chose to live there .
if they get their own schools , they will soon want their own government , their own land , their own country within germany . - andrea weidner , us erdogan 's proposal is not only counterproductive to the goals of integration but it is an obvious indication of the goals of turkey .
turkey is unwilling to create common ground with europe .
they expect europeans to change so as to accommodate turkish demands , culture language , and laws .
it should become obvious that turkey , a nation that will not allow a greek orthodox seminary to reopen , a nation which is based on the tenant " turkey for the turks " and has systematically persecuted its minorities with discriminatory laws , can not be allowed to have a say in the lives of the people of europe . - m. g. ikossi , us i was born turkey but have lived in the us for 48 years .
here , americans complain that spanish-speaking immigrants do not know english .
when you are in the us , you should learn english right away .
if parents do not know the new language and want their children to know their mother language , this is understandable , but these kids are going to live in us -lrb- or germany -rrb- .
they have to compete with germans or americans .
today i see turkish kids in germany who can not speak decent german .
when turks complain that their children can not go to high school and college , what do they expect ?
now erdogan wants germany to have turkish middle schools .
if german does that , i really do not know what to say . - engin sor , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" problems should n't be kept quiet , they have to be dealt with , " he 's said . zollitsch is considered a liberal and has advocated easing the church mandate that priests remain unmarried and celibate . he was born in 1938 to a german family in filipovo in former yugoslavia .

ukraine said it will begin paying off those debts as of thursday .
in return , russia said it would not make good on its threat to cut off gas supplies to ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal averted a major international incident ukraine receives about one quarter of its natural gas from russia .
the rest comes from central asia but passes through pipelines on russian territory .
russian gas , in turn , is often transported through ukraine to other countries . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs welcomed the deal as the basis to resolve future disputes .
most russian gas exports pass across ukrainian territory but both countries have assured europe that westward gas flows will not be interrupted . " the commission expects that this solution will establish the basis for a stable and solid bilateral energy relationship , " piebalgs said in a statement . disagreement remains over the extent of the debt .
moscow says it is owed 975 million euros -lrb- $ 1.45 billion -rrb- , while the ukrainian government says it is only 735 million euros in the red . russia and ukraine have repeatedly squabbled over gas prices and supplies since ukraine 's orange revolution of 2004 , but now the two sides agreed to form a working group to negotiate over future issues concerning the trade in and transport of natural gas . retargeting russian missiles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is strongly opposed to us plans for a missile defense system in eastern europe putin and yushchenko agreed to fix the price of russian gas for ukraine at 123 euros per 1,000 cubic meter for the remainder of this year . but lest anyone have thought the tension between the two uneasy neighbors was over , putin had a warning for ukraine about that country 's relationship with the western military alliance nato . kyiv hopes nato will approve a membership action plan for ukraine - a formal step towards membership - at the alliance 's bucharest summit in april .
moscow , however , views the expansion of nato as a threat to russian security . should kyiv allow nato missiles to be stationed in ukraine , putin told journalists , " russia would have no choice but to re-aim its -lsb- nuclear -rsb- warheads at ukrainian territory . " " i draw your attention to the consequences that would follow , " putin said .
" it is terrible to even think that in response to this .
russia can not theoretically exclude aiming our offensive missile systems at ukraine . " russia has fiercely rejected us plans to establish a missile defense shield in europe - with parts of the system being located in poland and the czech republic , both former russian allies from the soviet era . yushchenko defended his country 's right to maintain an independent foreign and defense policy .
but he said the ukrainian constitution prohibited foreign troops from being stationed within the country . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what do you think ?
are stock markets still a safe place to invest or is it better to put cash in an equity fund ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : arthur k. age : 33 occupation : accountant city / country : kampala , uganda i invest my money in unit trusts which has several portfolios like the money fund , balanaced investment scheme and high yield fund .
this ensures that i get a high return of say between 7-9 % as compared to the bank rates of 6 % p.a.
the unit trust caters for small investors like myself as you do n't need alot of money to make an investment .
besides since unit trust involve alot of many small investors pooling funds together , the impact of the chargers is not felt greatly by one individual as compared to bank accounts were the chargers are borne by the account holder .
in uganda some of the chargers include 15 % withholding tax and the bank service chargers .
incase of unit trusts these charges are shared equally among the investors thus increasing the value of return on investment .
i am also charged about 2.5 % on initial investment but that compared to the many hidden costs bank charged is a fair deal .
the 6 % interest or return banks offer is way below the 9-10 % inflation rate experienced annually in our economy .

in my country it is a very low risk investment as the demand is booming and it gives very good returns .

however , it may be risky and i could never tell whether it is secured and safe or not due to bankruptcy and corruption ...
as my mom told us ever before when my sister planned to have an educational plan for my younger brother who was born 6 years ago .
so , our family decided to keep our savings and incomes deposited in our several bank accounts and one of those accounts is for my brother 's future tuition fees because he will be nearly grade 1 student this june after finishing his kindergarten course .

i was planning to study again as i want to pursue a master 's degree ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 12.02.2008 french support for chad dictator makes eu uneasy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french defense minister morin supported chad 's president after a rebel crackdown after rebels were driven out of chad in a bloody battle , france , which had been seeking a neutral role in the volatile region , reverted to its traditional post-colonial policy of supporting an african dictator . since he was elected in may last year , french president nicolas sarkozy pledged to break away from the embarrassing old habit of propping up autocratic and corrupt ex-colonial regimes in africa . but sarkozy broke his promise last week after a brutal rebel attack in n 'djamena that left scores of civilians dead and forced tens of thousands to flee the chadian capital . the french government came down on the side of chad 's strongman idriss deby , who rose to power in a 1990 coup that had the blessing of sarkozy 's predecessors , leading observers to concluded that the more things change in france 's traditional africa policy , the more they remain the same . france ruled by national interests bildunterschrift : france has been pushing for an eu mission to stabilize chad 's border with darfur that policy , called francafrique , meant serving france 's strategic and commercial interests by continuing to exercise post-colonial influence through african rulers . although francafrique policy also meant supporting development in chad , togo and other french-speaking african nations , aid money often disappeared into the coffers of repressive dictators and their military backers , supporting one of the world 's most corrupt regimes and bleeding their impoverished countries dry . antoine glaser , the african affairs editor of the french newsletter " la lettre du continent " said that france 's africa policy is a huge battleship of bad habits that can be neither turned around nor torpedoed overnight .
furthermore , he said , france 's influence over the deby regime is waning . " the reality is that the french have less real influence in central africa than ever before , " said glaser . glaser added that france would have evacuated deby when the rebels stormed the presidential palace 10 days ago , but the chadian president refused the offer and drove the opposition out with government troops .
deby 's intransigency and the strength of the resistance took the french leadership by surprise , said glaser . no political middle ground in chad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france underestimated the deby regime 's resistance to rebel and opposition groups " the french completely underestimated the backing for deby and thought the rebels would overrun the palace , " he said .
" once deby won , france had to decide either to fully support him or not at all .
in chad , there is no middle ground .
you are either in or you are out . " only days before the rebel attack , french defense minister herve morin said that france would maintain " neutrality " in the central african country , which borders the sudanese crisis region of darfur , where refugees have been fleeing ethnic wars . france was even ready to see deby go but was surprised by his tenacity at holding on to power , said alex de waal , a program director specializing in african issues at the social science research council in new york . " now the french government sees no alternative to supporting a despotic dictator , since the opposition is viewed as destabilizing , " said de waal . a european union force , made up largely of french troops and intended to stabilize chad 's eastern border with darfur , however , has been delayed due to rebel violence .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on sunday , feb .
10 , that deployment would be resumed in the next few days . eu allies question french motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france evacuated foreign nationals from chad 's capital at the beginning of february but now that paris has taken deby 's side , france 's european partners , who had already been lukewarm about the operation , are getting cold feet . " the eu would have no choice but to support france , which supports deby , " said de waal .
" peacekeeping is a wonderful principle to protect african civilians , but it only works if the eu commits troops who are willing to fight and get killed . " analysts say that neither the germans nor the british are committing troops to the eu operation , partly because they suspect that france is using the eu umbrella to promote french national interests . the appointment of irishman pat nash as the mission 's commander-in-chief was not enough to convince germany to participate in a conflict dominated by the french , said dirk kohnert , an africa expert at the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg . " the french have an altruistic side , but also a very egotistical side , " said kohnert .
" france wants to be a global player outside of the eu context . " better uses of declining influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say deby offer to pardon french aid workers is tied to france 's political support france also wants to protect its export market in luxury consumer goods targeted at an extravagant african elite and french commercial interests in trading commodities , he added . chad is rich in gold , uranium and in recent years has also tapped reserves that make it an oil-exporting nation , but the french , unlike the american exxonmobil consortium , currently have virtually no oil interests in the region . marielle debos , a chad specialist at france 's elite university sciences po , however , played down the importance of economic ties .

furthermore , he said , france 's influence over the deby regime is waning . " the reality is that the french have less real influence in central africa than ever before , " said glaser . glaser added that france would have evacuated deby when the rebels stormed the presidential palace 10 days ago , but the chadian president refused the offer and drove the opposition out with government troops .
deby 's intransigency and the strength of the resistance took the french leadership by surprise , said glaser . no political middle ground in chad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france underestimated the deby regime 's resistance to rebel and opposition groups " the french completely underestimated the backing for deby and thought the rebels would overrun the palace , " he said .
" once deby won , france had to decide either to fully support him or not at all .
in chad , there is no middle ground .
you are either in or you are out . " only days before the rebel attack , french defense minister herve morin said that france would maintain " neutrality " in the central african country , which borders the sudanese crisis region of darfur , where refugees have been fleeing ethnic wars . france was even ready to see deby go but was surprised by his tenacity at holding on to power , said alex de waal , a program director specializing in african issues at the social science research council in new york . " now the french government sees no alternative to supporting a despotic dictator , since the opposition is viewed as destabilizing , " said de waal . a european union force , made up largely of french troops and intended to stabilize chad 's eastern border with darfur , however , has been delayed due to rebel violence .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on sunday , feb .
10 , that deployment would be resumed in the next few days . eu allies question french motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france evacuated foreign nationals from chad 's capital at the beginning of february but now that paris has taken deby 's side , france 's european partners , who had already been lukewarm about the operation , are getting cold feet . " the eu would have no choice but to support france , which supports deby , " said de waal .
" peacekeeping is a wonderful principle to protect african civilians , but it only works if the eu commits troops who are willing to fight and get killed . " analysts say that neither the germans nor the british are committing troops to the eu operation , partly because they suspect that france is using the eu umbrella to promote french national interests . the appointment of irishman pat nash as the mission 's commander-in-chief was not enough to convince germany to participate in a conflict dominated by the french , said dirk kohnert , an africa expert at the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg .

" france wants to be a global player outside of the eu context .

massive numbers of germany fans have been clamoring for euro 2008 tickets since the lottery process started in earnest .
unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far . the swiss and austrian organizers of euro 2008 may be taking a page out of germany 's book when it comes to trying to emulate the success of the world cup two years ago , but it seems that the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- itself has forgotten one of its main mistakes from 2006 . while the world cup in germany has been lauded as one of the most successfully organized global soccer events in modern history , one of the few aspects to cause chaos and consternation was the allocation of tickets . the complicated online lottery process , the exorbitant prices , the credit card monopolies and the minute numbers of tickets actually available to the everyday fan were just some of the complaints that dogged the almost-perfect tournament .
two years on , the dfb looks to have forgotten the stress and strain german fans went through to see their team play international soccer . a staggering 1.5 million tickets were requested by germany fans for the 14,400 available for their country 's three euro 2008 pool games in austria , the dfb said on wednesday , feb .
13 .
applications , whcih the dfb called " overwhelming , " closed at midnight on tuesday , leaving fans of joachim loew 's boys were again facing heartbreak . german fans destined for ticket disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niersbach had to try and rob goleo to get a world cup ticket " it seems to be german fans ' mission impossible to get tickets for euro 2008 , " dfb secretary-general wolfgang niersbuch said .
" unfortunately , there will be only a few joyful winners and it is a pity we have so few tickets to give away in a drawing which will take place at the end of the month . " the dfb , he admitted , was only handing over 14,400 of the 21,765 tickets it has to fans . " we also have to give tickets to our committees , the bundesliga clubs , the regional organizations , our sponsors and the players ' families get an allocation too , " niersbuch said . after the success of the 2006 world cup , the demand for germany 's first round matches against poland -lrb- june 8 -rrb- and croatia -lrb- june 12 -rrb- in the southern austrian city of klagenfurt , plus the clash with hosts austria in vienna -lrb- june 16 -rrb- , has gone through the roof . but the dfb can not be held fully responsible for the imminent distress .
some of the venues for the european championships are less than equipped for dealing with fans ' demands than the ticket allocation process itself . for example , germany 's potential group deciding clash against croatia in klagenfurt takes place in the 32,000-capacity hypo group arena , a stadium much smaller than many bundesliga venues . black market preparing for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rival fans may end up together with black market tickets for the two games in klagenfurt , the dfb gets 5,722 tickets per game with 10,321 available for the game against austria at the ernst happel stadium , which has a capacity of 50,000 . the result could see huge numbers of fans descending on the venues ahead of the games willing to part company with large sums of cash for tickets in various areas of the arenas , leading to security issues . with games against bitter rivals poland , notoriously volatile croatia and neighbors austria , placing germany fans in opposition blocks is something the authorities will want to avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most would-be ticket buyers are expected to go away empty-handed .

massive numbers of germany fans have been clamoring for euro 2008 tickets since the lottery process started in earnest .
unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far . the swiss and austrian organizers of euro 2008 may be taking a page out of germany 's book when it comes to trying to emulate the success of the world cup two years ago , but it seems that the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- itself has forgotten one of its main mistakes from 2006 . while the world cup in germany has been lauded as one of the most successfully organized global soccer events in modern history , one of the few aspects to cause chaos and consternation was the allocation of tickets . the complicated online lottery process , the exorbitant prices , the credit card monopolies and the minute numbers of tickets actually available to the everyday fan were just some of the complaints that dogged the almost-perfect tournament .
two years on , the dfb looks to have forgotten the stress and strain german fans went through to see their team play international soccer . a staggering 1.5 million tickets were requested by germany fans for the 14,400 available for their country 's three euro 2008 pool games in austria , the dfb said on wednesday , feb .
13 .
applications , whcih the dfb called " overwhelming , " closed at midnight on tuesday , leaving fans of joachim loew 's boys were again facing heartbreak . german fans destined for ticket disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niersbach had to try and rob goleo to get a world cup ticket " it seems to be german fans ' mission impossible to get tickets for euro 2008 , " dfb secretary-general wolfgang niersbuch said .
" unfortunately , there will be only a few joyful winners and it is a pity we have so few tickets to give away in a drawing which will take place at the end of the month . " the dfb , he admitted , was only handing over 14,400 of the 21,765 tickets it has to fans . " we also have to give tickets to our committees , the bundesliga clubs , the regional organizations , our sponsors and the players ' families get an allocation too , " niersbuch said . after the success of the 2006 world cup , the demand for germany 's first round matches against poland -lrb- june 8 -rrb- and croatia -lrb- june 12 -rrb- in the southern austrian city of klagenfurt , plus the clash with hosts austria in vienna -lrb- june 16 -rrb- , has gone through the roof . but the dfb can not be held fully responsible for the imminent distress .
some of the venues for the european championships are less than equipped for dealing with fans ' demands than the ticket allocation process itself . for example , germany 's potential group deciding clash against croatia in klagenfurt takes place in the 32,000-capacity hypo group arena , a stadium much smaller than many bundesliga venues . black market preparing for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rival fans may end up together with black market tickets for the two games in klagenfurt , the dfb gets 5,722 tickets per game with 10,321 available for the game against austria at the ernst happel stadium , which has a capacity of 50,000 . the result could see huge numbers of fans descending on the venues ahead of the games willing to part company with large sums of cash for tickets in various areas of the arenas , leading to security issues . with games against bitter rivals poland , notoriously volatile croatia and neighbors austria , placing germany fans in opposition blocks is something the authorities will want to avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far . the swiss and austrian organizers of euro 2008 may be taking a page out of germany 's book when it comes to trying to emulate the success of the world cup two years ago , but it seems that the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- itself has forgotten one of its main mistakes from 2006 . while the world cup in germany has been lauded as one of the most successfully organized global soccer events in modern history , one of the few aspects to cause chaos and consternation was the allocation of tickets . the complicated online lottery process , the exorbitant prices , the credit card monopolies and the minute numbers of tickets actually available to the everyday fan were just some of the complaints that dogged the almost-perfect tournament .
two years on , the dfb looks to have forgotten the stress and strain german fans went through to see their team play international soccer . a staggering 1.5 million tickets were requested by germany fans for the 14,400 available for their country 's three euro 2008 pool games in austria , the dfb said on wednesday , feb .
13 .
applications , whcih the dfb called " overwhelming , " closed at midnight on tuesday , leaving fans of joachim loew 's boys were again facing heartbreak . german fans destined for ticket disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niersbach had to try and rob goleo to get a world cup ticket " it seems to be german fans ' mission impossible to get tickets for euro 2008 , " dfb secretary-general wolfgang niersbuch said .
" unfortunately , there will be only a few joyful winners and it is a pity we have so few tickets to give away in a drawing which will take place at the end of the month . " the dfb , he admitted , was only handing over 14,400 of the 21,765 tickets it has to fans . " we also have to give tickets to our committees , the bundesliga clubs , the regional organizations , our sponsors and the players ' families get an allocation too , " niersbuch said . after the success of the 2006 world cup , the demand for germany 's first round matches against poland -lrb- june 8 -rrb- and croatia -lrb- june 12 -rrb- in the southern austrian city of klagenfurt , plus the clash with hosts austria in vienna -lrb- june 16 -rrb- , has gone through the roof . but the dfb can not be held fully responsible for the imminent distress .
some of the venues for the european championships are less than equipped for dealing with fans ' demands than the ticket allocation process itself . for example , germany 's potential group deciding clash against croatia in klagenfurt takes place in the 32,000-capacity hypo group arena , a stadium much smaller than many bundesliga venues . black market preparing for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rival fans may end up together with black market tickets for the two games in klagenfurt , the dfb gets 5,722 tickets per game with 10,321 available for the game against austria at the ernst happel stadium , which has a capacity of 50,000 . the result could see huge numbers of fans descending on the venues ahead of the games willing to part company with large sums of cash for tickets in various areas of the arenas , leading to security issues . with games against bitter rivals poland , notoriously volatile croatia and neighbors austria , placing germany fans in opposition blocks is something the authorities will want to avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they learned english from the radio , tv , playmates and school .
notwithstanding that they spoke their parents ' language at home and carried on many of the parents ' traditions , their parents encouraged them to learn american culture and to " fit in . "
they did fit in ; no one cared what they spoke at home , and today you would n't know that their parents did n't come over on the mayflower .

turkey is unwilling to create common ground with europe .
they expect europeans to change so as to accommodate turkish demands , culture language , and laws .
it should become obvious that turkey , a nation that will not allow a greek orthodox seminary to reopen , a nation which is based on the tenant " turkey for the turks " and has systematically persecuted its minorities with discriminatory laws , can not be allowed to have a say in the lives of the people of europe . - m. g. ikossi , us i was born turkey but have lived in the us for 48 years .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as an american who grew up in a small town with many first generation italian and greek immigrants , i am familiar with the issue of integration .
it was my experience that my contemporaries whose parents came from the " old country " spoke italian or greek at home .
they learned english from the radio , tv , playmates and school .
notwithstanding that they spoke their parents ' language at home and carried on many of the parents ' traditions , their parents encouraged them to learn american culture and to " fit in . "
they did fit in ; no one cared what they spoke at home , and today you would n't know that their parents did n't come over on the mayflower .
integration does not mean you forget where you family came from , it is adapting to where you are . - james fraser , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2.4 million turks make up the largest minority group in germany i think the turkish authorities have to understand what the german authorities are saying because every country has the way they do things .
having schools with a mother tongue in another country is far from the game .
globally , they say when in rome , do like romans , so i think if you are in germany , do like the germans . - victor c. okeke , nigeria erdogan is very much correct .
turkish people should not give up their culture and identity .
he should work to integrate as many back into turkish society as possible . - ed mueller , us the germans are out of their mind if they would allow such schools .
can you imagine germans immigrating to the us and demanding german-speaking schools ?
turks in germany must accept that they are becoming germans and if they do n't want to become germans , let them go to turkey . - peter , new zealand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before erdogan 's visit , nine turks were killed in a fire in ludwigshafen on feb .
3 the turks in germany should learn german .
they chose to live there .
if they get their own schools , they will soon want their own government , their own land , their own country within germany . - andrea weidner , us erdogan 's proposal is not only counterproductive to the goals of integration but it is an obvious indication of the goals of turkey .
turkey is unwilling to create common ground with europe .
they expect europeans to change so as to accommodate turkish demands , culture language , and laws .
it should become obvious that turkey , a nation that will not allow a greek orthodox seminary to reopen , a nation which is based on the tenant " turkey for the turks " and has systematically persecuted its minorities with discriminatory laws , can not be allowed to have a say in the lives of the people of europe . - m. g. ikossi , us i was born turkey but have lived in the us for 48 years .
here , americans complain that spanish-speaking immigrants do not know english .
when you are in the us , you should learn english right away .
if parents do not know the new language and want their children to know their mother language , this is understandable , but these kids are going to live in us -lrb- or germany -rrb- .

today i see turkish kids in germany who can not speak decent german .

are executives ' earnings obscene excess or legitimate incentive ?
a small-business owner in switzerland -lrb- known for being pro-business -rrb- is pushing through a referendum that would lop off the superfluous zeros . thomas minder gets a bit angry when he talks about severance packages and bonuses for managers . " those things come from the us and they 're not normal here in switzerland , " he said .
" this kind of corporate policy is sick and has to be changed . " minder , a small business owner from neuhausen am rheinfall in switzerland , has launched an initiative against exorbitant salaries for managers .
he says it 's unjust that some executives earn 600 times more than an average worker - and are even rewarded with seven-digit severance payments when they do a poor job and are dismissed . after a year and a half of campaigning , minder has nearly collected the 100,000 signatures that are necessary in switzerland for a referendum .
he and the signatories want the government to put an end to disproportionate executive salaries . salt in the wound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minder was hit hard when swiss air went bankrupt the reason behind minder 's efforts is personal .
about six years ago , swiss air placed a large order for hand lotion , lip balm and tooth paste with his small cosmetic company .

" when it came out a few months later that the ceo had gotten a settlement worth 12.5 million francs -lrb- 7.8 million euros , $ 11.4 million -rrb- , the world collapsed for us , " said minder . his campaign has hit a nerve with the swiss .
manager salaries in switzerland continue to rise disproportionately to workers ' wages - just like in germany , where the debate heated up several weeks ago . according to the investment management fund ethos , executive earnings at switzerland 's 20 largest companies rose 17 percent from 2005 to 2006 .
workers ' wages , on the other hand , only increased by 2.5 percent at most . unusual , but not unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is a direct democracy the discrepancy upsets a lot of people , said political scientist thomas milic from the university of zurich . milic , whose research focuses on public referenda , said that milic 's referendum has a chance , even though statistics suggest the contrary .
of the 200 or so petitions for referenda that have come from the swiss populace , only 15 have gone through , he said . once the 100,000 required signatures have been collected , the parliament has to put it to a public vote within three years , according to swiss law .
milic warned , though , that the government tends to water down the laws before they are voted on and present them side-by-side with counter-proposals . however , minder has the politicians on his side , too .

the initiative calls for banning termination pay , advances and bonuses for selling or buying a company . what 's more , stockholders would determine executives ' salaries , not executives themselves .

are executives ' earnings obscene excess or legitimate incentive ?
a small-business owner in switzerland -lrb- known for being pro-business -rrb- is pushing through a referendum that would lop off the superfluous zeros . thomas minder gets a bit angry when he talks about severance packages and bonuses for managers . " those things come from the us and they 're not normal here in switzerland , " he said .
" this kind of corporate policy is sick and has to be changed . " minder , a small business owner from neuhausen am rheinfall in switzerland , has launched an initiative against exorbitant salaries for managers .
he says it 's unjust that some executives earn 600 times more than an average worker - and are even rewarded with seven-digit severance payments when they do a poor job and are dismissed . after a year and a half of campaigning , minder has nearly collected the 100,000 signatures that are necessary in switzerland for a referendum .
he and the signatories want the government to put an end to disproportionate executive salaries . salt in the wound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minder was hit hard when swiss air went bankrupt the reason behind minder 's efforts is personal .
about six years ago , swiss air placed a large order for hand lotion , lip balm and tooth paste with his small cosmetic company .
when the airline declared bankruptcy shortly thereafter , minder 's firm was stuck with a pile of toiletries and an unpaid bill . " when it came out a few months later that the ceo had gotten a settlement worth 12.5 million francs -lrb- 7.8 million euros , $ 11.4 million -rrb- , the world collapsed for us , " said minder . his campaign has hit a nerve with the swiss .
manager salaries in switzerland continue to rise disproportionately to workers ' wages - just like in germany , where the debate heated up several weeks ago . according to the investment management fund ethos , executive earnings at switzerland 's 20 largest companies rose 17 percent from 2005 to 2006 .
workers ' wages , on the other hand , only increased by 2.5 percent at most . unusual , but not unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is a direct democracy the discrepancy upsets a lot of people , said political scientist thomas milic from the university of zurich . milic , whose research focuses on public referenda , said that milic 's referendum has a chance , even though statistics suggest the contrary .
of the 200 or so petitions for referenda that have come from the swiss populace , only 15 have gone through , he said . once the 100,000 required signatures have been collected , the parliament has to put it to a public vote within three years , according to swiss law .
milic warned , though , that the government tends to water down the laws before they are voted on and present them side-by-side with counter-proposals . however , minder has the politicians on his side , too .
the social democrats , the green party and a leftist splinter party are behind his initiative ; only the right-wing swiss people 's party has n't yet taken a position . stockholders to take charge if minder 's demands are taken on by the electorate , companies listed on swiss stock exchange would have to make some changes .
the initiative calls for banning termination pay , advances and bonuses for selling or buying a company . what 's more , stockholders would determine executives ' salaries , not executives themselves .
minder aims to protect the company owners from the " boundless greed " of its executives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the chances are good for minder 's initiative still , he does n't see himself as a socialist crusader .
" i think civically and very liberally , " he said .
" the proposal is quite business friendly . " pressure from market-minded swiss wolf linder , a political scientist at the university of berne , said he did n't think minder 's proposal was business-friendly enough . " the swiss think in a much more economically liberal way than the germans , " he said .

" kosovo has coal , lead and a workforce , but it lies in a corner of europe where only a few tourists ever go , " she wrote .

kosovo sits on an estimated 15 billion tons of coal .
the potential for supply and demand is evident in these forecasted figures , but the state of kosovo 's coal industry will have to improve radically if the new state is to be the main provider of that extra power .
" if this succeeds , kosovo could even become an exporter of electricity , " kaps said .
however , the development of kosovo 's industry can only happen after political and juridical relations are made stable .
" the most important stabilization factor would be that kosovo and serbia are brought into the eu , " he added .
until kosovo gets on its feet , the country would have to rely on help from outside its new borders .
the money which flows in from kosovars in other countries is a main source of income to the province .

wedgwood is one of those who see kosovo as having little to gain from independence .
" kosovo has coal , lead and a workforce , but it lies in a corner of europe where only a few tourists ever go , " she wrote .

kosovo sits on an estimated 15 billion tons of coal .
the potential for supply and demand is evident in these forecasted figures , but the state of kosovo 's coal industry will have to improve radically if the new state is to be the main provider of that extra power .
" if this succeeds , kosovo could even become an exporter of electricity , " kaps said .
however , the development of kosovo 's industry can only happen after political and juridical relations are made stable .
" the most important stabilization factor would be that kosovo and serbia are brought into the eu , " he added .

olmert also brushed aside suggestions that iran was no longer a danger after a us intelligence report in december found that tehran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
the israeli prime minister referred to iran 's continued pursuit of uranium enrichment as justification for his country 's belief that iran was receiving nuclear fuel from russia for something other than a civilian nuclear program .

olmert also brushed aside suggestions that iran was no longer a danger after a us intelligence report in december found that tehran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
the israeli prime minister referred to iran 's continued pursuit of uranium enrichment as justification for his country 's belief that iran was receiving nuclear fuel from russia for something other than a civilian nuclear program .
olmert said there could be no other reason for iran 's activities .
" the iranians are moving forward with their plans to create a capacity for non-conventional weapons .

the series continues in poland . klara lives in the old town in warsaw .
she said she is lucky because she lives in an apartment owned by her father , so she avoids paying a mortgage or rent .
it 's a 38 square-meter -lrb- 409 square-foot -rrb- studio apartment in one of the city 's most expensive neighborhoods . klara lives a short walk to the center of the city and a 15-minute walk to the subway station .
she works as the chief editor of a supplement to a national newspaper . monthly income : 8,000 zloty -lrb- 2,210 euros , $ 3,264 -rrb- rent : 360 zloty in management fees -lrb- 100 euros , $ 147 -rrb- monthly utilities : 150 zloty -lrb- 41.45 euros , $ 61.20 -rrb- bus / metro ticket : 2.40 zloty -lrb- 0.66 euros , $ 0.97 -rrb- one liter milk : 2.80 zloty -lrb- 0.77 euros , $ 1.14 -rrb- loaf of bread : 3.00 zloty -lrb- 0.83 euro , $ 1.22 -rrb- one kilogram sugar : 1.50 zloty -lrb- 0.41 euros , $ 0.61 -rrb- domestic stamp : 1.80 zloty -lrb- 0.50 euros , $ 0.73 -rrb- movie ticket : 22 zloty -lrb- 6.00 euros , $ 8.97 -rrb- have you noticed that things have become more expensive recently ? i have on some products , but i 'm not the kind of consumer who would really feel this .
it would not affect me that much .
i can tell that things have become more expensive overall , but not too much ; it 's just the normal kind of inflation process for most products . it 's hard for me to tell because i often have the impression that they randomly make some products more expensive in small shops , the kind of shops where i go .
if a product sells well , for example , and that 's because they know that the people who live here are tied to them so they can afford to lift prices sometimes .
i buy sardines very often and i can see they are popular in this particular shop because they have more and more kinds , and they 're more expensive in a very obvious way .
so we 're talking about a store that can afford to manipulate prices because they 're the only one around here - and it 's difficult to set up a shop in the old town . how easy is it for you to get by ? i earn a rather high wage so i certainly do n't struggle .
but i 'm also lucky because i own an apartment and do n't have to pay a mortgage .
i think most people who are in my income bracket with a steady job will very often be burdened by a mortgage , which might mean they sometimes have problems .
i 'm lucky enough to have this apartment that was given to me by my dad .
i earn well and i have a rather wealthy family .
i might not be the most representative consumer . what about for most people in poland is it easy for them to get by financially ? it depends .
people i know from work who are journalists will probably earn around 6,000 zloty -lrb- 1,658 euros , $ 2,447 -rrb- per month before taxes , and if they have a mortgage , like most of them do , then sometimes they will struggle .
but they do n't struggle to the extent where they ca n't afford to go out and have something to eat in town once a month or have a few drinks .
generally i do n't see them as being handicapped in their leisure time or social life .
of course , they can not afford to go out every night and have meals in restaurants all the time . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? i 'm worried that the finance market crash in the united states will somehow affect the european economy , especially the british economy since it 's a bit more tied up and similar to the american economy .
i 'm afraid that england might take a hit and if england takes a hit then other countries are just as likely to be somehow affected by that . i 'm not sure how poland would react , but the interdependence is so complex that that 's my main worry . for the european economy in general , whatever happens , we will always suffer from everything else that happens in the world .

massive numbers of germany fans have been clamoring for euro 2008 tickets since the lottery process started in earnest .
unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far . the swiss and austrian organizers of euro 2008 may be taking a page out of germany 's book when it comes to trying to emulate the success of the world cup two years ago , but it seems that the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- itself has forgotten one of its main mistakes from 2006 . while the world cup in germany has been lauded as one of the most successfully organized global soccer events in modern history , one of the few aspects to cause chaos and consternation was the allocation of tickets . the complicated online lottery process , the exorbitant prices , the credit card monopolies and the minute numbers of tickets actually available to the everyday fan were just some of the complaints that dogged the almost-perfect tournament .
two years on , the dfb looks to have forgotten the stress and strain german fans went through to see their team play international soccer . a staggering 1.5 million tickets were requested by germany fans for the 14,400 available for their country 's three euro 2008 pool games in austria , the dfb said on wednesday , feb .
13 .
applications , whcih the dfb called " overwhelming , " closed at midnight on tuesday , leaving fans of joachim loew 's boys were again facing heartbreak . german fans destined for ticket disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niersbach had to try and rob goleo to get a world cup ticket " it seems to be german fans ' mission impossible to get tickets for euro 2008 , " dfb secretary-general wolfgang niersbuch said .
" unfortunately , there will be only a few joyful winners and it is a pity we have so few tickets to give away in a drawing which will take place at the end of the month . " the dfb , he admitted , was only handing over 14,400 of the 21,765 tickets it has to fans . " we also have to give tickets to our committees , the bundesliga clubs , the regional organizations , our sponsors and the players ' families get an allocation too , " niersbuch said . after the success of the 2006 world cup , the demand for germany 's first round matches against poland -lrb- june 8 -rrb- and croatia -lrb- june 12 -rrb- in the southern austrian city of klagenfurt , plus the clash with hosts austria in vienna -lrb- june 16 -rrb- , has gone through the roof . but the dfb can not be held fully responsible for the imminent distress .
some of the venues for the european championships are less than equipped for dealing with fans ' demands than the ticket allocation process itself . for example , germany 's potential group deciding clash against croatia in klagenfurt takes place in the 32,000-capacity hypo group arena , a stadium much smaller than many bundesliga venues . black market preparing for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rival fans may end up together with black market tickets for the two games in klagenfurt , the dfb gets 5,722 tickets per game with 10,321 available for the game against austria at the ernst happel stadium , which has a capacity of 50,000 . the result could see huge numbers of fans descending on the venues ahead of the games willing to part company with large sums of cash for tickets in various areas of the arenas , leading to security issues . with games against bitter rivals poland , notoriously volatile croatia and neighbors austria , placing germany fans in opposition blocks is something the authorities will want to avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but serious issues still divide the two neighbors . the russian and ukrainian presidents met for more than three hours in moscow , before announcing that the deal had been concluded on tuesday , feb .
12 . at issue were the huge debts kiev owes to moscow for natural gas supplies to ukraine .
ukraine said it will begin paying off those debts as of thursday .
in return , russia said it would not make good on its threat to cut off gas supplies to ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal averted a major international incident ukraine receives about one quarter of its natural gas from russia .
the rest comes from central asia but passes through pipelines on russian territory .
russian gas , in turn , is often transported through ukraine to other countries . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs welcomed the deal as the basis to resolve future disputes .
most russian gas exports pass across ukrainian territory but both countries have assured europe that westward gas flows will not be interrupted . " the commission expects that this solution will establish the basis for a stable and solid bilateral energy relationship , " piebalgs said in a statement . disagreement remains over the extent of the debt .
moscow says it is owed 975 million euros -lrb- $ 1.45 billion -rrb- , while the ukrainian government says it is only 735 million euros in the red . russia and ukraine have repeatedly squabbled over gas prices and supplies since ukraine 's orange revolution of 2004 , but now the two sides agreed to form a working group to negotiate over future issues concerning the trade in and transport of natural gas . retargeting russian missiles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is strongly opposed to us plans for a missile defense system in eastern europe putin and yushchenko agreed to fix the price of russian gas for ukraine at 123 euros per 1,000 cubic meter for the remainder of this year . but lest anyone have thought the tension between the two uneasy neighbors was over , putin had a warning for ukraine about that country 's relationship with the western military alliance nato . kyiv hopes nato will approve a membership action plan for ukraine - a formal step towards membership - at the alliance 's bucharest summit in april .
moscow , however , views the expansion of nato as a threat to russian security . should kyiv allow nato missiles to be stationed in ukraine , putin told journalists , " russia would have no choice but to re-aim its -lsb- nuclear -rsb- warheads at ukrainian territory . " " i draw your attention to the consequences that would follow , " putin said .
" it is terrible to even think that in response to this .

are executives ' earnings obscene excess or legitimate incentive ?
a small-business owner in switzerland -lrb- known for being pro-business -rrb- is pushing through a referendum that would lop off the superfluous zeros . thomas minder gets a bit angry when he talks about severance packages and bonuses for managers . " those things come from the us and they 're not normal here in switzerland , " he said .
" this kind of corporate policy is sick and has to be changed . " minder , a small business owner from neuhausen am rheinfall in switzerland , has launched an initiative against exorbitant salaries for managers .
he says it 's unjust that some executives earn 600 times more than an average worker - and are even rewarded with seven-digit severance payments when they do a poor job and are dismissed . after a year and a half of campaigning , minder has nearly collected the 100,000 signatures that are necessary in switzerland for a referendum .
he and the signatories want the government to put an end to disproportionate executive salaries . salt in the wound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minder was hit hard when swiss air went bankrupt the reason behind minder 's efforts is personal .
about six years ago , swiss air placed a large order for hand lotion , lip balm and tooth paste with his small cosmetic company .

a small-business owner in switzerland -lrb- known for being pro-business -rrb- is pushing through a referendum that would lop off the superfluous zeros . thomas minder gets a bit angry when he talks about severance packages and bonuses for managers .

wedgwood is one of those who see kosovo as having little to gain from independence .
" kosovo has coal , lead and a workforce , but it lies in a corner of europe where only a few tourists ever go , " she wrote .
politically , she added , there is no need for kosovo to pursue independence now that slobodan milosevic is no longer in power .
franz kaps , the world bank 's special envoy to southern europe until may last year , sees things in less pessimistic terms .
now an independent advisor to the bank , kaps believes that it is kosovo 's coal reserves which will help support it through its transition to an independent state and beyond .
electricity demand a lifeline for kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's coal industry could be its economic savior southern europe , the world bank predicts , will need additional electricity of up to 4.5 gigawatts by 2012 .
kosovo sits on an estimated 15 billion tons of coal .
the potential for supply and demand is evident in these forecasted figures , but the state of kosovo 's coal industry will have to improve radically if the new state is to be the main provider of that extra power .
" if this succeeds , kosovo could even become an exporter of electricity , " kaps said .
however , the development of kosovo 's industry can only happen after political and juridical relations are made stable .
" the most important stabilization factor would be that kosovo and serbia are brought into the eu , " he added .
until kosovo gets on its feet , the country would have to rely on help from outside its new borders .
the money which flows in from kosovars in other countries is a main source of income to the province .
according to estimates , about 450 million euros per year comes in from the kosovar diaspora .
" this is the source of kosovo 's traditional economic aid , " said karl kaser , a professor for southeast-european history at the university of graz in austria .

" at that time , one had the feeling that everything was improving , " said kaser .
“ everywhere there were new houses and hotels being built .
but then , in 1989 , the political problems began . "
kaser believes it will be impossible for kosovo to remain part of serbia .
a large part of kosovo 's population wants independence .
but with independence , the new country can forget about any help from belgrade .
" serbia has made it clear that it will not invest in an independent kosovo , " said kaser .
kosovo 's economic future lies with the eu and the creation of a stable government , he added .
for kosovo to develop a coal industry capable of sustaining the new country , it would need to attract foreign investors .
however , kaser fears that any investors would be in it for a fast buck and that any profits would soon be taken out of the country .

the potential for supply and demand is evident in these forecasted figures , but the state of kosovo 's coal industry will have to improve radically if the new state is to be the main provider of that extra power .
" if this succeeds , kosovo could even become an exporter of electricity , " kaps said .
however , the development of kosovo 's industry can only happen after political and juridical relations are made stable .
" the most important stabilization factor would be that kosovo and serbia are brought into the eu , " he added .
until kosovo gets on its feet , the country would have to rely on help from outside its new borders .
the money which flows in from kosovars in other countries is a main source of income to the province .
according to estimates , about 450 million euros per year comes in from the kosovar diaspora .
" this is the source of kosovo 's traditional economic aid , " said karl kaser , a professor for southeast-european history at the university of graz in austria .

" at that time , one had the feeling that everything was improving , " said kaser .
“ everywhere there were new houses and hotels being built .
but then , in 1989 , the political problems began . "
kaser believes it will be impossible for kosovo to remain part of serbia .
a large part of kosovo 's population wants independence .
but with independence , the new country can forget about any help from belgrade .
" serbia has made it clear that it will not invest in an independent kosovo , " said kaser .
kosovo 's economic future lies with the eu and the creation of a stable government , he added .
for kosovo to develop a coal industry capable of sustaining the new country , it would need to attract foreign investors .
however , kaser fears that any investors would be in it for a fast buck and that any profits would soon be taken out of the country .

the world bank hopes the country would be able to support itself through its coal deposits .
some economists are not convinced it will be that easy . it could all happen on february 17 .
observers are expecting kosovo to declare its independence on sunday .
independence will give the albanian majority what it has been dreaming of : secession from serbia .
however , behind all the hope and optimism which stirs in the province ahead of the declaration there is still some uncertainty over whether kosovo - known during the cold war as " yugoslavia 's poorhouse " - will be able to support itself economically as a new nation state .
even today , kosovo rates as one of the poorest regions in europe .
according to the world bank , the average annual salary for the population is 1,243 euros -lrb- $ 1,803 -rrb- .
it reports that 37 percent of the population lives in poverty and survives on less than 1.42 euros a day .

the skepticism increases in relation to the anticipation of imminent independence .
" the secessionists ignore the economic realities , " ruth wedgwood , a professor for international law and diplomacy at john hopkins university in baltimore , wrote in a commentary in the wall street journal on feb .
9 .
wedgwood is one of those who see kosovo as having little to gain from independence .
" kosovo has coal , lead and a workforce , but it lies in a corner of europe where only a few tourists ever go , " she wrote .
politically , she added , there is no need for kosovo to pursue independence now that slobodan milosevic is no longer in power .
franz kaps , the world bank 's special envoy to southern europe until may last year , sees things in less pessimistic terms .
now an independent advisor to the bank , kaps believes that it is kosovo 's coal reserves which will help support it through its transition to an independent state and beyond .

olmert also brushed aside suggestions that iran was no longer a danger after a us intelligence report in december found that tehran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .

olmert said there could be no other reason for iran 's activities .
" the iranians are moving forward with their plans to create a capacity for non-conventional weapons .
there is evidence that the plan of the iranians is not that naive and innocent , " olmert said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reiterated her diplomatic stance to olmert germany , along with the five permanent members of the un security council , was currently working on the text of a third resolution on iran , she noted .
olmert also spoke of the palestinian situation , saying that israel faced a " very unusual situation " in attempting to conduct negotiations while at the same time coming under attack , not only from gaza but from other parts of the palestinian territories .
the prime minister did , however , vow to fight terrorism from hamas-controlled gaza " in every possible manner " but refused to directly comment on statements made by israeli defense minister ehud barak , who indicated monday that israel might try to overthrow the hamas regime .
gaza-based terrorism " the israeli government under my leadership is absolutely determined to respond to the challenge of terrorism from gaza in every possible manner which will be effective , " olmert said at the press conference .
" we will not hesitate , we will not stop and we will do what 's necessary to be done . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could israel be preparing an offensive against hamas ?
in a veiled reference to barak 's statements , olmert said : " i know that there are lots of speculations ... discussions ... suggestions and propositions everywhere of what we can do exactly , " he added .
" that , i 'm afraid , i will not share with you . "
at the same time , he said israel " will continue our negotiations with the palestinian authority " under west bank-based president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad .
chancellor passes merkel refused to criticize israel 's current blockade of gaza and the restriction of electricity supplies .
" i know that the humanitarian situation in gaza strip is difficult , and we are trying to help in this regard where we can , " she said .
" but the simplest answer is that the targeting of the israeli state , the terrorist activities must be ended , " merkel added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 12.02.2008 french support for chad dictator makes eu uneasy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french defense minister morin supported chad 's president after a rebel crackdown after rebels were driven out of chad in a bloody battle , france , which had been seeking a neutral role in the volatile region , reverted to its traditional post-colonial policy of supporting an african dictator . since he was elected in may last year , french president nicolas sarkozy pledged to break away from the embarrassing old habit of propping up autocratic and corrupt ex-colonial regimes in africa . but sarkozy broke his promise last week after a brutal rebel attack in n 'djamena that left scores of civilians dead and forced tens of thousands to flee the chadian capital . the french government came down on the side of chad 's strongman idriss deby , who rose to power in a 1990 coup that had the blessing of sarkozy 's predecessors , leading observers to concluded that the more things change in france 's traditional africa policy , the more they remain the same . france ruled by national interests bildunterschrift : france has been pushing for an eu mission to stabilize chad 's border with darfur that policy , called francafrique , meant serving france 's strategic and commercial interests by continuing to exercise post-colonial influence through african rulers . although francafrique policy also meant supporting development in chad , togo and other french-speaking african nations , aid money often disappeared into the coffers of repressive dictators and their military backers , supporting one of the world 's most corrupt regimes and bleeding their impoverished countries dry . antoine glaser , the african affairs editor of the french newsletter " la lettre du continent " said that france 's africa policy is a huge battleship of bad habits that can be neither turned around nor torpedoed overnight .
furthermore , he said , france 's influence over the deby regime is waning . " the reality is that the french have less real influence in central africa than ever before , " said glaser . glaser added that france would have evacuated deby when the rebels stormed the presidential palace 10 days ago , but the chadian president refused the offer and drove the opposition out with government troops .
deby 's intransigency and the strength of the resistance took the french leadership by surprise , said glaser . no political middle ground in chad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france underestimated the deby regime 's resistance to rebel and opposition groups " the french completely underestimated the backing for deby and thought the rebels would overrun the palace , " he said .
" once deby won , france had to decide either to fully support him or not at all .
in chad , there is no middle ground .
you are either in or you are out . " only days before the rebel attack , french defense minister herve morin said that france would maintain " neutrality " in the central african country , which borders the sudanese crisis region of darfur , where refugees have been fleeing ethnic wars . france was even ready to see deby go but was surprised by his tenacity at holding on to power , said alex de waal , a program director specializing in african issues at the social science research council in new york .

furthermore , he said , france 's influence over the deby regime is waning . " the reality is that the french have less real influence in central africa than ever before , " said glaser . glaser added that france would have evacuated deby when the rebels stormed the presidential palace 10 days ago , but the chadian president refused the offer and drove the opposition out with government troops .
deby 's intransigency and the strength of the resistance took the french leadership by surprise , said glaser . no political middle ground in chad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france underestimated the deby regime 's resistance to rebel and opposition groups " the french completely underestimated the backing for deby and thought the rebels would overrun the palace , " he said .
" once deby won , france had to decide either to fully support him or not at all .
in chad , there is no middle ground .
you are either in or you are out . " only days before the rebel attack , french defense minister herve morin said that france would maintain " neutrality " in the central african country , which borders the sudanese crisis region of darfur , where refugees have been fleeing ethnic wars . france was even ready to see deby go but was surprised by his tenacity at holding on to power , said alex de waal , a program director specializing in african issues at the social science research council in new york . " now the french government sees no alternative to supporting a despotic dictator , since the opposition is viewed as destabilizing , " said de waal . a european union force , made up largely of french troops and intended to stabilize chad 's eastern border with darfur , however , has been delayed due to rebel violence .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on sunday , feb .
10 , that deployment would be resumed in the next few days . eu allies question french motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france evacuated foreign nationals from chad 's capital at the beginning of february but now that paris has taken deby 's side , france 's european partners , who had already been lukewarm about the operation , are getting cold feet .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as an american who grew up in a small town with many first generation italian and greek immigrants , i am familiar with the issue of integration .
it was my experience that my contemporaries whose parents came from the " old country " spoke italian or greek at home .
they learned english from the radio , tv , playmates and school .
notwithstanding that they spoke their parents ' language at home and carried on many of the parents ' traditions , their parents encouraged them to learn american culture and to " fit in . "
they did fit in ; no one cared what they spoke at home , and today you would n't know that their parents did n't come over on the mayflower .
integration does not mean you forget where you family came from , it is adapting to where you are . - james fraser , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2.4 million turks make up the largest minority group in germany i think the turkish authorities have to understand what the german authorities are saying because every country has the way they do things .
having schools with a mother tongue in another country is far from the game .
globally , they say when in rome , do like romans , so i think if you are in germany , do like the germans . - victor c. okeke , nigeria erdogan is very much correct .
turkish people should not give up their culture and identity .
he should work to integrate as many back into turkish society as possible . - ed mueller , us the germans are out of their mind if they would allow such schools .
can you imagine germans immigrating to the us and demanding german-speaking schools ?
turks in germany must accept that they are becoming germans and if they do n't want to become germans , let them go to turkey . - peter , new zealand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before erdogan 's visit , nine turks were killed in a fire in ludwigshafen on feb .
3 the turks in germany should learn german .
they chose to live there .
if they get their own schools , they will soon want their own government , their own land , their own country within germany . - andrea weidner , us erdogan 's proposal is not only counterproductive to the goals of integration but it is an obvious indication of the goals of turkey .
turkey is unwilling to create common ground with europe .
they expect europeans to change so as to accommodate turkish demands , culture language , and laws .
it should become obvious that turkey , a nation that will not allow a greek orthodox seminary to reopen , a nation which is based on the tenant " turkey for the turks " and has systematically persecuted its minorities with discriminatory laws , can not be allowed to have a say in the lives of the people of europe . - m. g. ikossi , us i was born turkey but have lived in the us for 48 years .
here , americans complain that spanish-speaking immigrants do not know english .
when you are in the us , you should learn english right away .
if parents do not know the new language and want their children to know their mother language , this is understandable , but these kids are going to live in us -lrb- or germany -rrb- .
they have to compete with germans or americans .
today i see turkish kids in germany who can not speak decent german .

here 's what some dw readers had to say . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as an american who grew up in a small town with many first generation italian and greek immigrants , i am familiar with the issue of integration .
it was my experience that my contemporaries whose parents came from the " old country " spoke italian or greek at home .
they learned english from the radio , tv , playmates and school .
notwithstanding that they spoke their parents ' language at home and carried on many of the parents ' traditions , their parents encouraged them to learn american culture and to " fit in . "
they did fit in ; no one cared what they spoke at home , and today you would n't know that their parents did n't come over on the mayflower .
integration does not mean you forget where you family came from , it is adapting to where you are . - james fraser , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2.4 million turks make up the largest minority group in germany i think the turkish authorities have to understand what the german authorities are saying because every country has the way they do things .
having schools with a mother tongue in another country is far from the game .
globally , they say when in rome , do like romans , so i think if you are in germany , do like the germans . - victor c. okeke , nigeria erdogan is very much correct .
turkish people should not give up their culture and identity .
he should work to integrate as many back into turkish society as possible . - ed mueller , us the germans are out of their mind if they would allow such schools .
can you imagine germans immigrating to the us and demanding german-speaking schools ?
turks in germany must accept that they are becoming germans and if they do n't want to become germans , let them go to turkey . - peter , new zealand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before erdogan 's visit , nine turks were killed in a fire in ludwigshafen on feb .
3 the turks in germany should learn german .
they chose to live there .
if they get their own schools , they will soon want their own government , their own land , their own country within germany . - andrea weidner , us erdogan 's proposal is not only counterproductive to the goals of integration but it is an obvious indication of the goals of turkey .
turkey is unwilling to create common ground with europe .
they expect europeans to change so as to accommodate turkish demands , culture language , and laws .
it should become obvious that turkey , a nation that will not allow a greek orthodox seminary to reopen , a nation which is based on the tenant " turkey for the turks " and has systematically persecuted its minorities with discriminatory laws , can not be allowed to have a say in the lives of the people of europe . - m. g. ikossi , us i was born turkey but have lived in the us for 48 years .
here , americans complain that spanish-speaking immigrants do not know english .
when you are in the us , you should learn english right away .
if parents do not know the new language and want their children to know their mother language , this is understandable , but these kids are going to live in us -lrb- or germany -rrb- .
they have to compete with germans or americans .
today i see turkish kids in germany who can not speak decent german .
when turks complain that their children can not go to high school and college , what do they expect ?
now erdogan wants germany to have turkish middle schools .

massive numbers of germany fans have been clamoring for euro 2008 tickets since the lottery process started in earnest .
unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far . the swiss and austrian organizers of euro 2008 may be taking a page out of germany 's book when it comes to trying to emulate the success of the world cup two years ago , but it seems that the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- itself has forgotten one of its main mistakes from 2006 . while the world cup in germany has been lauded as one of the most successfully organized global soccer events in modern history , one of the few aspects to cause chaos and consternation was the allocation of tickets . the complicated online lottery process , the exorbitant prices , the credit card monopolies and the minute numbers of tickets actually available to the everyday fan were just some of the complaints that dogged the almost-perfect tournament .
two years on , the dfb looks to have forgotten the stress and strain german fans went through to see their team play international soccer . a staggering 1.5 million tickets were requested by germany fans for the 14,400 available for their country 's three euro 2008 pool games in austria , the dfb said on wednesday , feb .
13 .
applications , whcih the dfb called " overwhelming , " closed at midnight on tuesday , leaving fans of joachim loew 's boys were again facing heartbreak . german fans destined for ticket disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niersbach had to try and rob goleo to get a world cup ticket " it seems to be german fans ' mission impossible to get tickets for euro 2008 , " dfb secretary-general wolfgang niersbuch said .
" unfortunately , there will be only a few joyful winners and it is a pity we have so few tickets to give away in a drawing which will take place at the end of the month . " the dfb , he admitted , was only handing over 14,400 of the 21,765 tickets it has to fans . " we also have to give tickets to our committees , the bundesliga clubs , the regional organizations , our sponsors and the players ' families get an allocation too , " niersbuch said . after the success of the 2006 world cup , the demand for germany 's first round matches against poland -lrb- june 8 -rrb- and croatia -lrb- june 12 -rrb- in the southern austrian city of klagenfurt , plus the clash with hosts austria in vienna -lrb- june 16 -rrb- , has gone through the roof . but the dfb can not be held fully responsible for the imminent distress .
some of the venues for the european championships are less than equipped for dealing with fans ' demands than the ticket allocation process itself . for example , germany 's potential group deciding clash against croatia in klagenfurt takes place in the 32,000-capacity hypo group arena , a stadium much smaller than many bundesliga venues . black market preparing for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rival fans may end up together with black market tickets for the two games in klagenfurt , the dfb gets 5,722 tickets per game with 10,321 available for the game against austria at the ernst happel stadium , which has a capacity of 50,000 . the result could see huge numbers of fans descending on the venues ahead of the games willing to part company with large sums of cash for tickets in various areas of the arenas , leading to security issues . with games against bitter rivals poland , notoriously volatile croatia and neighbors austria , placing germany fans in opposition blocks is something the authorities will want to avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far . the swiss and austrian organizers of euro 2008 may be taking a page out of germany 's book when it comes to trying to emulate the success of the world cup two years ago , but it seems that the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- itself has forgotten one of its main mistakes from 2006 . while the world cup in germany has been lauded as one of the most successfully organized global soccer events in modern history , one of the few aspects to cause chaos and consternation was the allocation of tickets . the complicated online lottery process , the exorbitant prices , the credit card monopolies and the minute numbers of tickets actually available to the everyday fan were just some of the complaints that dogged the almost-perfect tournament .
two years on , the dfb looks to have forgotten the stress and strain german fans went through to see their team play international soccer . a staggering 1.5 million tickets were requested by germany fans for the 14,400 available for their country 's three euro 2008 pool games in austria , the dfb said on wednesday , feb .

applications , whcih the dfb called " overwhelming , " closed at midnight on tuesday , leaving fans of joachim loew 's boys were again facing heartbreak . german fans destined for ticket disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niersbach had to try and rob goleo to get a world cup ticket " it seems to be german fans ' mission impossible to get tickets for euro 2008 , " dfb secretary-general wolfgang niersbuch said .
" unfortunately , there will be only a few joyful winners and it is a pity we have so few tickets to give away in a drawing which will take place at the end of the month . " the dfb , he admitted , was only handing over 14,400 of the 21,765 tickets it has to fans . " we also have to give tickets to our committees , the bundesliga clubs , the regional organizations , our sponsors and the players ' families get an allocation too , " niersbuch said . after the success of the 2006 world cup , the demand for germany 's first round matches against poland -lrb- june 8 -rrb- and croatia -lrb- june 12 -rrb- in the southern austrian city of klagenfurt , plus the clash with hosts austria in vienna -lrb- june 16 -rrb- , has gone through the roof . but the dfb can not be held fully responsible for the imminent distress .
some of the venues for the european championships are less than equipped for dealing with fans ' demands than the ticket allocation process itself . for example , germany 's potential group deciding clash against croatia in klagenfurt takes place in the 32,000-capacity hypo group arena , a stadium much smaller than many bundesliga venues . black market preparing for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rival fans may end up together with black market tickets for the two games in klagenfurt , the dfb gets 5,722 tickets per game with 10,321 available for the game against austria at the ernst happel stadium , which has a capacity of 50,000 . the result could see huge numbers of fans descending on the venues ahead of the games willing to part company with large sums of cash for tickets in various areas of the arenas , leading to security issues . with games against bitter rivals poland , notoriously volatile croatia and neighbors austria , placing germany fans in opposition blocks is something the authorities will want to avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world bank hopes the country would be able to support itself through its coal deposits .
some economists are not convinced it will be that easy . it could all happen on february 17 .
observers are expecting kosovo to declare its independence on sunday .
independence will give the albanian majority what it has been dreaming of : secession from serbia .
however , behind all the hope and optimism which stirs in the province ahead of the declaration there is still some uncertainty over whether kosovo - known during the cold war as " yugoslavia 's poorhouse " - will be able to support itself economically as a new nation state .
even today , kosovo rates as one of the poorest regions in europe .
according to the world bank , the average annual salary for the population is 1,243 euros -lrb- $ 1,803 -rrb- .
it reports that 37 percent of the population lives in poverty and survives on less than 1.42 euros a day .
those who suffer the most are the most vulnerable : the children , old people , families without male breadwinners , the disabled , the unemployed , and the non-serbian ethnic minorities like the roma .
poverty-stricken province ignoring realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the optimism is tempered by skepticism how can such a country survive economically ?
the skepticism increases in relation to the anticipation of imminent independence .
" the secessionists ignore the economic realities , " ruth wedgwood , a professor for international law and diplomacy at john hopkins university in baltimore , wrote in a commentary in the wall street journal on feb .
9 .
wedgwood is one of those who see kosovo as having little to gain from independence .
" kosovo has coal , lead and a workforce , but it lies in a corner of europe where only a few tourists ever go , " she wrote .
politically , she added , there is no need for kosovo to pursue independence now that slobodan milosevic is no longer in power .
franz kaps , the world bank 's special envoy to southern europe until may last year , sees things in less pessimistic terms .
now an independent advisor to the bank , kaps believes that it is kosovo 's coal reserves which will help support it through its transition to an independent state and beyond .
electricity demand a lifeline for kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's coal industry could be its economic savior southern europe , the world bank predicts , will need additional electricity of up to 4.5 gigawatts by 2012 .
kosovo sits on an estimated 15 billion tons of coal .
the potential for supply and demand is evident in these forecasted figures , but the state of kosovo 's coal industry will have to improve radically if the new state is to be the main provider of that extra power .
" if this succeeds , kosovo could even become an exporter of electricity , " kaps said .
however , the development of kosovo 's industry can only happen after political and juridical relations are made stable .
" the most important stabilization factor would be that kosovo and serbia are brought into the eu , " he added .
until kosovo gets on its feet , the country would have to rely on help from outside its new borders .
the money which flows in from kosovars in other countries is a main source of income to the province .
according to estimates , about 450 million euros per year comes in from the kosovar diaspora .
" this is the source of kosovo 's traditional economic aid , " said karl kaser , a professor for southeast-european history at the university of graz in austria .
donations and eu support could be key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo : cash donations accepted kaser can remember a time when this flow of money was even greater .
in the early 1980s , he visited the region and reported on a flow of cash coming from the north of yugoslavia to the south .
" at that time , one had the feeling that everything was improving , " said kaser .
“ everywhere there were new houses and hotels being built .
but then , in 1989 , the political problems began . "
kaser believes it will be impossible for kosovo to remain part of serbia .
a large part of kosovo 's population wants independence .
but with independence , the new country can forget about any help from belgrade .
" serbia has made it clear that it will not invest in an independent kosovo , " said kaser .
kosovo 's economic future lies with the eu and the creation of a stable government , he added .
for kosovo to develop a coal industry capable of sustaining the new country , it would need to attract foreign investors .
however , kaser fears that any investors would be in it for a fast buck and that any profits would soon be taken out of the country .
despite the uncertainty and obvious hard times ahead , kaser looks forward with optimism , and with no small amount of gallows humor , to an independent kosovo .

massive numbers of germany fans have been clamoring for euro 2008 tickets since the lottery process started in earnest .
unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far . the swiss and austrian organizers of euro 2008 may be taking a page out of germany 's book when it comes to trying to emulate the success of the world cup two years ago , but it seems that the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- itself has forgotten one of its main mistakes from 2006 . while the world cup in germany has been lauded as one of the most successfully organized global soccer events in modern history , one of the few aspects to cause chaos and consternation was the allocation of tickets . the complicated online lottery process , the exorbitant prices , the credit card monopolies and the minute numbers of tickets actually available to the everyday fan were just some of the complaints that dogged the almost-perfect tournament .
two years on , the dfb looks to have forgotten the stress and strain german fans went through to see their team play international soccer . a staggering 1.5 million tickets were requested by germany fans for the 14,400 available for their country 's three euro 2008 pool games in austria , the dfb said on wednesday , feb .
13 .
applications , whcih the dfb called " overwhelming , " closed at midnight on tuesday , leaving fans of joachim loew 's boys were again facing heartbreak . german fans destined for ticket disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niersbach had to try and rob goleo to get a world cup ticket " it seems to be german fans ' mission impossible to get tickets for euro 2008 , " dfb secretary-general wolfgang niersbuch said .
" unfortunately , there will be only a few joyful winners and it is a pity we have so few tickets to give away in a drawing which will take place at the end of the month . " the dfb , he admitted , was only handing over 14,400 of the 21,765 tickets it has to fans . " we also have to give tickets to our committees , the bundesliga clubs , the regional organizations , our sponsors and the players ' families get an allocation too , " niersbuch said . after the success of the 2006 world cup , the demand for germany 's first round matches against poland -lrb- june 8 -rrb- and croatia -lrb- june 12 -rrb- in the southern austrian city of klagenfurt , plus the clash with hosts austria in vienna -lrb- june 16 -rrb- , has gone through the roof . but the dfb can not be held fully responsible for the imminent distress .
some of the venues for the european championships are less than equipped for dealing with fans ' demands than the ticket allocation process itself . for example , germany 's potential group deciding clash against croatia in klagenfurt takes place in the 32,000-capacity hypo group arena , a stadium much smaller than many bundesliga venues . black market preparing for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rival fans may end up together with black market tickets for the two games in klagenfurt , the dfb gets 5,722 tickets per game with 10,321 available for the game against austria at the ernst happel stadium , which has a capacity of 50,000 . the result could see huge numbers of fans descending on the venues ahead of the games willing to part company with large sums of cash for tickets in various areas of the arenas , leading to security issues . with games against bitter rivals poland , notoriously volatile croatia and neighbors austria , placing germany fans in opposition blocks is something the authorities will want to avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

massive numbers of germany fans have been clamoring for euro 2008 tickets since the lottery process started in earnest .
unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far . the swiss and austrian organizers of euro 2008 may be taking a page out of germany 's book when it comes to trying to emulate the success of the world cup two years ago , but it seems that the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- itself has forgotten one of its main mistakes from 2006 . while the world cup in germany has been lauded as one of the most successfully organized global soccer events in modern history , one of the few aspects to cause chaos and consternation was the allocation of tickets . the complicated online lottery process , the exorbitant prices , the credit card monopolies and the minute numbers of tickets actually available to the everyday fan were just some of the complaints that dogged the almost-perfect tournament .
two years on , the dfb looks to have forgotten the stress and strain german fans went through to see their team play international soccer . a staggering 1.5 million tickets were requested by germany fans for the 14,400 available for their country 's three euro 2008 pool games in austria , the dfb said on wednesday , feb .

applications , whcih the dfb called " overwhelming , " closed at midnight on tuesday , leaving fans of joachim loew 's boys were again facing heartbreak . german fans destined for ticket disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niersbach had to try and rob goleo to get a world cup ticket " it seems to be german fans ' mission impossible to get tickets for euro 2008 , " dfb secretary-general wolfgang niersbuch said .
" unfortunately , there will be only a few joyful winners and it is a pity we have so few tickets to give away in a drawing which will take place at the end of the month . " the dfb , he admitted , was only handing over 14,400 of the 21,765 tickets it has to fans .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as an american who grew up in a small town with many first generation italian and greek immigrants , i am familiar with the issue of integration .
it was my experience that my contemporaries whose parents came from the " old country " spoke italian or greek at home .
they learned english from the radio , tv , playmates and school .
notwithstanding that they spoke their parents ' language at home and carried on many of the parents ' traditions , their parents encouraged them to learn american culture and to " fit in . "
they did fit in ; no one cared what they spoke at home , and today you would n't know that their parents did n't come over on the mayflower .
integration does not mean you forget where you family came from , it is adapting to where you are . - james fraser , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2.4 million turks make up the largest minority group in germany i think the turkish authorities have to understand what the german authorities are saying because every country has the way they do things .
having schools with a mother tongue in another country is far from the game .
globally , they say when in rome , do like romans , so i think if you are in germany , do like the germans . - victor c. okeke , nigeria erdogan is very much correct .
turkish people should not give up their culture and identity .
he should work to integrate as many back into turkish society as possible . - ed mueller , us the germans are out of their mind if they would allow such schools .
can you imagine germans immigrating to the us and demanding german-speaking schools ?
turks in germany must accept that they are becoming germans and if they do n't want to become germans , let them go to turkey . - peter , new zealand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before erdogan 's visit , nine turks were killed in a fire in ludwigshafen on feb .
3 the turks in germany should learn german .
they chose to live there .
if they get their own schools , they will soon want their own government , their own land , their own country within germany . - andrea weidner , us erdogan 's proposal is not only counterproductive to the goals of integration but it is an obvious indication of the goals of turkey .
turkey is unwilling to create common ground with europe .
they expect europeans to change so as to accommodate turkish demands , culture language , and laws .
it should become obvious that turkey , a nation that will not allow a greek orthodox seminary to reopen , a nation which is based on the tenant " turkey for the turks " and has systematically persecuted its minorities with discriminatory laws , can not be allowed to have a say in the lives of the people of europe . - m. g. ikossi , us i was born turkey but have lived in the us for 48 years .
here , americans complain that spanish-speaking immigrants do not know english .
when you are in the us , you should learn english right away .
if parents do not know the new language and want their children to know their mother language , this is understandable , but these kids are going to live in us -lrb- or germany -rrb- .
they have to compete with germans or americans .
today i see turkish kids in germany who can not speak decent german .

12 , that he believed iran was continuing to work on acquiring a nuclear weapon . " nothing that we know has changed our attitudes , " olmert told a joint press conference with german chancellor angela merkel .
" we are certain the iranians are engaged in serious clandestine operations to build an unconventional weapon , " he said .
olmert also brushed aside suggestions that iran was no longer a danger after a us intelligence report in december found that tehran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
the israeli prime minister referred to iran 's continued pursuit of uranium enrichment as justification for his country 's belief that iran was receiving nuclear fuel from russia for something other than a civilian nuclear program .
olmert said there could be no other reason for iran 's activities .
" the iranians are moving forward with their plans to create a capacity for non-conventional weapons .
there is evidence that the plan of the iranians is not that naive and innocent , " olmert said .
" this is a main challenge .
we ca n't afford to make one mistake on that issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is highly suspicious of president ahmadinejad " this is mainly the challenge of the big powers ; israel inevitably is ... very interested in these efforts and we will join forces and cooperate with our senior friends in order to help a possible solution that will deter the iranians from continuing their program , " the prime minister added .
asked whether a military response was still an option , olmert cited us president george w. bush as saying that " no option is ruled out . "
support for diplomacy merkel said germany would continue its dual strategy of pressing iran to comply with the demands of the international community on halting enrichment and of offering economic incentives if it did .
" i have said over and over again that i firmly believe in a solution by diplomatic means and that i am banking on a diplomatic solution , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reiterated her diplomatic stance to olmert germany , along with the five permanent members of the un security council , was currently working on the text of a third resolution on iran , she noted .
olmert also spoke of the palestinian situation , saying that israel faced a " very unusual situation " in attempting to conduct negotiations while at the same time coming under attack , not only from gaza but from other parts of the palestinian territories .
the prime minister did , however , vow to fight terrorism from hamas-controlled gaza " in every possible manner " but refused to directly comment on statements made by israeli defense minister ehud barak , who indicated monday that israel might try to overthrow the hamas regime .
gaza-based terrorism " the israeli government under my leadership is absolutely determined to respond to the challenge of terrorism from gaza in every possible manner which will be effective , " olmert said at the press conference .
" we will not hesitate , we will not stop and we will do what 's necessary to be done . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could israel be preparing an offensive against hamas ?
in a veiled reference to barak 's statements , olmert said : " i know that there are lots of speculations ... discussions ... suggestions and propositions everywhere of what we can do exactly , " he added .
" that , i 'm afraid , i will not share with you . "
at the same time , he said israel " will continue our negotiations with the palestinian authority " under west bank-based president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad .

the world bank hopes the country would be able to support itself through its coal deposits .
some economists are not convinced it will be that easy . it could all happen on february 17 .
observers are expecting kosovo to declare its independence on sunday .
independence will give the albanian majority what it has been dreaming of : secession from serbia .
however , behind all the hope and optimism which stirs in the province ahead of the declaration there is still some uncertainty over whether kosovo - known during the cold war as " yugoslavia 's poorhouse " - will be able to support itself economically as a new nation state .
even today , kosovo rates as one of the poorest regions in europe .
according to the world bank , the average annual salary for the population is 1,243 euros -lrb- $ 1,803 -rrb- .
it reports that 37 percent of the population lives in poverty and survives on less than 1.42 euros a day .
those who suffer the most are the most vulnerable : the children , old people , families without male breadwinners , the disabled , the unemployed , and the non-serbian ethnic minorities like the roma .
poverty-stricken province ignoring realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the optimism is tempered by skepticism how can such a country survive economically ?
the skepticism increases in relation to the anticipation of imminent independence .
" the secessionists ignore the economic realities , " ruth wedgwood , a professor for international law and diplomacy at john hopkins university in baltimore , wrote in a commentary in the wall street journal on feb .
9 .
wedgwood is one of those who see kosovo as having little to gain from independence .
" kosovo has coal , lead and a workforce , but it lies in a corner of europe where only a few tourists ever go , " she wrote .
politically , she added , there is no need for kosovo to pursue independence now that slobodan milosevic is no longer in power .
franz kaps , the world bank 's special envoy to southern europe until may last year , sees things in less pessimistic terms .
now an independent advisor to the bank , kaps believes that it is kosovo 's coal reserves which will help support it through its transition to an independent state and beyond .
electricity demand a lifeline for kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's coal industry could be its economic savior southern europe , the world bank predicts , will need additional electricity of up to 4.5 gigawatts by 2012 .
kosovo sits on an estimated 15 billion tons of coal .
the potential for supply and demand is evident in these forecasted figures , but the state of kosovo 's coal industry will have to improve radically if the new state is to be the main provider of that extra power .
" if this succeeds , kosovo could even become an exporter of electricity , " kaps said .
however , the development of kosovo 's industry can only happen after political and juridical relations are made stable .
" the most important stabilization factor would be that kosovo and serbia are brought into the eu , " he added .
until kosovo gets on its feet , the country would have to rely on help from outside its new borders .
the money which flows in from kosovars in other countries is a main source of income to the province .
according to estimates , about 450 million euros per year comes in from the kosovar diaspora .
" this is the source of kosovo 's traditional economic aid , " said karl kaser , a professor for southeast-european history at the university of graz in austria .
donations and eu support could be key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo : cash donations accepted kaser can remember a time when this flow of money was even greater .
in the early 1980s , he visited the region and reported on a flow of cash coming from the north of yugoslavia to the south .
" at that time , one had the feeling that everything was improving , " said kaser .
“ everywhere there were new houses and hotels being built .
but then , in 1989 , the political problems began . "
kaser believes it will be impossible for kosovo to remain part of serbia .
a large part of kosovo 's population wants independence .
but with independence , the new country can forget about any help from belgrade .
" serbia has made it clear that it will not invest in an independent kosovo , " said kaser .
kosovo 's economic future lies with the eu and the creation of a stable government , he added .
for kosovo to develop a coal industry capable of sustaining the new country , it would need to attract foreign investors .
however , kaser fears that any investors would be in it for a fast buck and that any profits would soon be taken out of the country .
despite the uncertainty and obvious hard times ahead , kaser looks forward with optimism , and with no small amount of gallows humor , to an independent kosovo .

kosovo sits on an estimated 15 billion tons of coal .
the potential for supply and demand is evident in these forecasted figures , but the state of kosovo 's coal industry will have to improve radically if the new state is to be the main provider of that extra power .
" if this succeeds , kosovo could even become an exporter of electricity , " kaps said .
however , the development of kosovo 's industry can only happen after political and juridical relations are made stable .
" the most important stabilization factor would be that kosovo and serbia are brought into the eu , " he added .
until kosovo gets on its feet , the country would have to rely on help from outside its new borders .
the money which flows in from kosovars in other countries is a main source of income to the province .
according to estimates , about 450 million euros per year comes in from the kosovar diaspora .

" this kind of corporate policy is sick and has to be changed . " minder , a small business owner from neuhausen am rheinfall in switzerland , has launched an initiative against exorbitant salaries for managers .
he says it 's unjust that some executives earn 600 times more than an average worker - and are even rewarded with seven-digit severance payments when they do a poor job and are dismissed . after a year and a half of campaigning , minder has nearly collected the 100,000 signatures that are necessary in switzerland for a referendum .

about six years ago , swiss air placed a large order for hand lotion , lip balm and tooth paste with his small cosmetic company .

manager salaries in switzerland continue to rise disproportionately to workers ' wages - just like in germany , where the debate heated up several weeks ago . according to the investment management fund ethos , executive earnings at switzerland 's 20 largest companies rose 17 percent from 2005 to 2006 .
workers ' wages , on the other hand , only increased by 2.5 percent at most . unusual , but not unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is a direct democracy the discrepancy upsets a lot of people , said political scientist thomas milic from the university of zurich . milic , whose research focuses on public referenda , said that milic 's referendum has a chance , even though statistics suggest the contrary .
of the 200 or so petitions for referenda that have come from the swiss populace , only 15 have gone through , he said . once the 100,000 required signatures have been collected , the parliament has to put it to a public vote within three years , according to swiss law .
milic warned , though , that the government tends to water down the laws before they are voted on and present them side-by-side with counter-proposals . however , minder has the politicians on his side , too .
the social democrats , the green party and a leftist splinter party are behind his initiative ; only the right-wing swiss people 's party has n't yet taken a position . stockholders to take charge if minder 's demands are taken on by the electorate , companies listed on swiss stock exchange would have to make some changes .
the initiative calls for banning termination pay , advances and bonuses for selling or buying a company . what 's more , stockholders would determine executives ' salaries , not executives themselves .
minder aims to protect the company owners from the " boundless greed " of its executives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the chances are good for minder 's initiative still , he does n't see himself as a socialist crusader .

a small-business owner in switzerland -lrb- known for being pro-business -rrb- is pushing through a referendum that would lop off the superfluous zeros . thomas minder gets a bit angry when he talks about severance packages and bonuses for managers . " those things come from the us and they 're not normal here in switzerland , " he said .

furthermore , he said , france 's influence over the deby regime is waning . " the reality is that the french have less real influence in central africa than ever before , " said glaser . glaser added that france would have evacuated deby when the rebels stormed the presidential palace 10 days ago , but the chadian president refused the offer and drove the opposition out with government troops .
deby 's intransigency and the strength of the resistance took the french leadership by surprise , said glaser . no political middle ground in chad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france underestimated the deby regime 's resistance to rebel and opposition groups " the french completely underestimated the backing for deby and thought the rebels would overrun the palace , " he said .
" once deby won , france had to decide either to fully support him or not at all .
in chad , there is no middle ground .
you are either in or you are out . " only days before the rebel attack , french defense minister herve morin said that france would maintain " neutrality " in the central african country , which borders the sudanese crisis region of darfur , where refugees have been fleeing ethnic wars . france was even ready to see deby go but was surprised by his tenacity at holding on to power , said alex de waal , a program director specializing in african issues at the social science research council in new york . " now the french government sees no alternative to supporting a despotic dictator , since the opposition is viewed as destabilizing , " said de waal . a european union force , made up largely of french troops and intended to stabilize chad 's eastern border with darfur , however , has been delayed due to rebel violence .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on sunday , feb .
10 , that deployment would be resumed in the next few days . eu allies question french motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france evacuated foreign nationals from chad 's capital at the beginning of february but now that paris has taken deby 's side , france 's european partners , who had already been lukewarm about the operation , are getting cold feet . " the eu would have no choice but to support france , which supports deby , " said de waal .
" peacekeeping is a wonderful principle to protect african civilians , but it only works if the eu commits troops who are willing to fight and get killed . " analysts say that neither the germans nor the british are committing troops to the eu operation , partly because they suspect that france is using the eu umbrella to promote french national interests . the appointment of irishman pat nash as the mission 's commander-in-chief was not enough to convince germany to participate in a conflict dominated by the french , said dirk kohnert , an africa expert at the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg . " the french have an altruistic side , but also a very egotistical side , " said kohnert .
" france wants to be a global player outside of the eu context . " better uses of declining influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say deby offer to pardon french aid workers is tied to france 's political support france also wants to protect its export market in luxury consumer goods targeted at an extravagant african elite and french commercial interests in trading commodities , he added . chad is rich in gold , uranium and in recent years has also tapped reserves that make it an oil-exporting nation , but the french , unlike the american exxonmobil consortium , currently have virtually no oil interests in the region . marielle debos , a chad specialist at france 's elite university sciences po , however , played down the importance of economic ties . " france wants to maintain strategic and military influence in central africa , but there are no truly good reasons for french interventionist policies in central africa , " said debos . she said france could have used its influence to play a more constructive role in chad by promoting national dialogue and addressing the root causes of the current conflict . olivier thimonier , who is a spokesman for survie , a ngo that is lobbying for more democracy and human rights in africa , added that civil opposition leaders , who were unarmed and arrested during the rebellion , should be released . " if france can intervene on behalf of deby , it can also intervene to promote a more open political system , " he said .
" things are quiet in chad at the moment , but there is still unrest and anti-french sentiment below the surface .
over the long term , the solution to conflict must be political engagement , not military suppression . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 12.02.2008 french support for chad dictator makes eu uneasy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french defense minister morin supported chad 's president after a rebel crackdown after rebels were driven out of chad in a bloody battle , france , which had been seeking a neutral role in the volatile region , reverted to its traditional post-colonial policy of supporting an african dictator . since he was elected in may last year , french president nicolas sarkozy pledged to break away from the embarrassing old habit of propping up autocratic and corrupt ex-colonial regimes in africa . but sarkozy broke his promise last week after a brutal rebel attack in n 'djamena that left scores of civilians dead and forced tens of thousands to flee the chadian capital . the french government came down on the side of chad 's strongman idriss deby , who rose to power in a 1990 coup that had the blessing of sarkozy 's predecessors , leading observers to concluded that the more things change in france 's traditional africa policy , the more they remain the same . france ruled by national interests bildunterschrift : france has been pushing for an eu mission to stabilize chad 's border with darfur that policy , called francafrique , meant serving france 's strategic and commercial interests by continuing to exercise post-colonial influence through african rulers . although francafrique policy also meant supporting development in chad , togo and other french-speaking african nations , aid money often disappeared into the coffers of repressive dictators and their military backers , supporting one of the world 's most corrupt regimes and bleeding their impoverished countries dry . antoine glaser , the african affairs editor of the french newsletter " la lettre du continent " said that france 's africa policy is a huge battleship of bad habits that can be neither turned around nor torpedoed overnight .
furthermore , he said , france 's influence over the deby regime is waning . " the reality is that the french have less real influence in central africa than ever before , " said glaser . glaser added that france would have evacuated deby when the rebels stormed the presidential palace 10 days ago , but the chadian president refused the offer and drove the opposition out with government troops .
deby 's intransigency and the strength of the resistance took the french leadership by surprise , said glaser . no political middle ground in chad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france underestimated the deby regime 's resistance to rebel and opposition groups " the french completely underestimated the backing for deby and thought the rebels would overrun the palace , " he said .
" once deby won , france had to decide either to fully support him or not at all .
in chad , there is no middle ground .
you are either in or you are out . " only days before the rebel attack , french defense minister herve morin said that france would maintain " neutrality " in the central african country , which borders the sudanese crisis region of darfur , where refugees have been fleeing ethnic wars . france was even ready to see deby go but was surprised by his tenacity at holding on to power , said alex de waal , a program director specializing in african issues at the social science research council in new york . " now the french government sees no alternative to supporting a despotic dictator , since the opposition is viewed as destabilizing , " said de waal . a european union force , made up largely of french troops and intended to stabilize chad 's eastern border with darfur , however , has been delayed due to rebel violence .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on sunday , feb .
10 , that deployment would be resumed in the next few days . eu allies question french motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france evacuated foreign nationals from chad 's capital at the beginning of february but now that paris has taken deby 's side , france 's european partners , who had already been lukewarm about the operation , are getting cold feet . " the eu would have no choice but to support france , which supports deby , " said de waal .
" peacekeeping is a wonderful principle to protect african civilians , but it only works if the eu commits troops who are willing to fight and get killed . " analysts say that neither the germans nor the british are committing troops to the eu operation , partly because they suspect that france is using the eu umbrella to promote french national interests . the appointment of irishman pat nash as the mission 's commander-in-chief was not enough to convince germany to participate in a conflict dominated by the french , said dirk kohnert , an africa expert at the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg . " the french have an altruistic side , but also a very egotistical side , " said kohnert .
" france wants to be a global player outside of the eu context . " better uses of declining influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say deby offer to pardon french aid workers is tied to france 's political support france also wants to protect its export market in luxury consumer goods targeted at an extravagant african elite and french commercial interests in trading commodities , he added . chad is rich in gold , uranium and in recent years has also tapped reserves that make it an oil-exporting nation , but the french , unlike the american exxonmobil consortium , currently have virtually no oil interests in the region . marielle debos , a chad specialist at france 's elite university sciences po , however , played down the importance of economic ties . " france wants to maintain strategic and military influence in central africa , but there are no truly good reasons for french interventionist policies in central africa , " said debos . she said france could have used its influence to play a more constructive role in chad by promoting national dialogue and addressing the root causes of the current conflict . olivier thimonier , who is a spokesman for survie , a ngo that is lobbying for more democracy and human rights in africa , added that civil opposition leaders , who were unarmed and arrested during the rebellion , should be released . " if france can intervene on behalf of deby , it can also intervene to promote a more open political system , " he said .
" things are quiet in chad at the moment , but there is still unrest and anti-french sentiment below the surface .
over the long term , the solution to conflict must be political engagement , not military suppression . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would not affect me that much .
i can tell that things have become more expensive overall , but not too much ; it 's just the normal kind of inflation process for most products . it 's hard for me to tell because i often have the impression that they randomly make some products more expensive in small shops , the kind of shops where i go .
if a product sells well , for example , and that 's because they know that the people who live here are tied to them so they can afford to lift prices sometimes .
i buy sardines very often and i can see they are popular in this particular shop because they have more and more kinds , and they 're more expensive in a very obvious way .
so we 're talking about a store that can afford to manipulate prices because they 're the only one around here - and it 's difficult to set up a shop in the old town . how easy is it for you to get by ? i earn a rather high wage so i certainly do n't struggle .
but i 'm also lucky because i own an apartment and do n't have to pay a mortgage .
i think most people who are in my income bracket with a steady job will very often be burdened by a mortgage , which might mean they sometimes have problems .
i 'm lucky enough to have this apartment that was given to me by my dad .
i earn well and i have a rather wealthy family .
i might not be the most representative consumer . what about for most people in poland is it easy for them to get by financially ? it depends .
people i know from work who are journalists will probably earn around 6,000 zloty -lrb- 1,658 euros , $ 2,447 -rrb- per month before taxes , and if they have a mortgage , like most of them do , then sometimes they will struggle .
but they do n't struggle to the extent where they ca n't afford to go out and have something to eat in town once a month or have a few drinks .
generally i do n't see them as being handicapped in their leisure time or social life .
of course , they can not afford to go out every night and have meals in restaurants all the time . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? i 'm worried that the finance market crash in the united states will somehow affect the european economy , especially the british economy since it 's a bit more tied up and similar to the american economy .
i 'm afraid that england might take a hit and if england takes a hit then other countries are just as likely to be somehow affected by that . i 'm not sure how poland would react , but the interdependence is so complex that that 's my main worry . for the european economy in general , whatever happens , we will always suffer from everything else that happens in the world .
that 's not big news .
but for me one of the key problems is the lack of workers ' mobility between countries .
that 's really something that puts us behind emerging economies like india and china and the united states , obviously , the fact that we do n't move enough . in saying that , i know how many poles have moved to england recently and i know what kind of effect it has on the british and the polish economies , how positive overall this is .
i 'm sure that there will be people in britain who might not be happy about having this flood of immigrants going there , but i think that it gave a boost to the british economy . it gave a boost to the polish economy , because , first of all , the unemployment rate fell and , secondly , because people often send money back home .
when they come back those people would have benefitted enormously , because just being in another culture , to see the know-how , they would have learnt the language , they might have established economic ties with britain .
i think that if there were more movements like that within europe it would certainly benefit everybody . nb .

but the debate over whether scientology is a sect or a genuine religion is sure to continue . an administrative appellate court in muenster handed down the verdict in the case , brought by the scientology organization , which challenged an early decision allowing government surveillance . the muenster judges found that the federal office for the protection of the constitution was within its authority to keep scientologists under observation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of a new scientology center in berlin last year stirred controversy in the statement announcing the verdict , the court said that there were " numerous indications " that the scientology organization promoted a form of society " in which central constitutional values such as the dignity of mankind and the right to equal treatment would be suspended or restricted . " " in particular , there is the suspicion that in a scientological society only scientologists would enjoy civil rights , " the court decided . the office for the protection of the constitution , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , has had scientology under surveillance since 1997 . misunderstood faith or public hazard ? the organization itself argued that it is a religious association that does not pursue political goals in the sense of the laws established to protect germany 's constitution . but the court rejected the argument , deeming it irrelevant to a case for or against surveillance . germany officially considers scientology a business rather than a religion .
no charges have ever been brought as a result of government surveillance . nonetheless , the court said the scientology movement was " trying to expand personally and to spread scientological principles more and more within government , the economy and society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor tom cruise is one of the movement 's most prominent members scientology was set up by author l. ron hubbard in 1954 in the united states .
the organization 's official web site describes its aims as seeking " only evolution to higher states of being for the individual and for society . " the german court also heard testimony concerning a number of anti-democratic remarks made by hubbard .
the court found that no evidence of the movement distancing itself from those opinions . the church of scientology says it will appeal the ruling and called for an end to the surveillance . " the german federal office for the protection of the constitution should finally end this farce and turn its attention to real enemies of the constitution and real danger so as to do what it is there for : to protect the german constitution and the basic rights of the people , " the organization said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 12.02.2008 french support for chad dictator makes eu uneasy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french defense minister morin supported chad 's president after a rebel crackdown after rebels were driven out of chad in a bloody battle , france , which had been seeking a neutral role in the volatile region , reverted to its traditional post-colonial policy of supporting an african dictator . since he was elected in may last year , french president nicolas sarkozy pledged to break away from the embarrassing old habit of propping up autocratic and corrupt ex-colonial regimes in africa . but sarkozy broke his promise last week after a brutal rebel attack in n 'djamena that left scores of civilians dead and forced tens of thousands to flee the chadian capital . the french government came down on the side of chad 's strongman idriss deby , who rose to power in a 1990 coup that had the blessing of sarkozy 's predecessors , leading observers to concluded that the more things change in france 's traditional africa policy , the more they remain the same . france ruled by national interests bildunterschrift : france has been pushing for an eu mission to stabilize chad 's border with darfur that policy , called francafrique , meant serving france 's strategic and commercial interests by continuing to exercise post-colonial influence through african rulers . although francafrique policy also meant supporting development in chad , togo and other french-speaking african nations , aid money often disappeared into the coffers of repressive dictators and their military backers , supporting one of the world 's most corrupt regimes and bleeding their impoverished countries dry . antoine glaser , the african affairs editor of the french newsletter " la lettre du continent " said that france 's africa policy is a huge battleship of bad habits that can be neither turned around nor torpedoed overnight .
furthermore , he said , france 's influence over the deby regime is waning . " the reality is that the french have less real influence in central africa than ever before , " said glaser . glaser added that france would have evacuated deby when the rebels stormed the presidential palace 10 days ago , but the chadian president refused the offer and drove the opposition out with government troops .
deby 's intransigency and the strength of the resistance took the french leadership by surprise , said glaser . no political middle ground in chad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france underestimated the deby regime 's resistance to rebel and opposition groups " the french completely underestimated the backing for deby and thought the rebels would overrun the palace , " he said .
" once deby won , france had to decide either to fully support him or not at all .
in chad , there is no middle ground .
you are either in or you are out . " only days before the rebel attack , french defense minister herve morin said that france would maintain " neutrality " in the central african country , which borders the sudanese crisis region of darfur , where refugees have been fleeing ethnic wars . france was even ready to see deby go but was surprised by his tenacity at holding on to power , said alex de waal , a program director specializing in african issues at the social science research council in new york . " now the french government sees no alternative to supporting a despotic dictator , since the opposition is viewed as destabilizing , " said de waal . a european union force , made up largely of french troops and intended to stabilize chad 's eastern border with darfur , however , has been delayed due to rebel violence .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on sunday , feb .
10 , that deployment would be resumed in the next few days . eu allies question french motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france evacuated foreign nationals from chad 's capital at the beginning of february but now that paris has taken deby 's side , france 's european partners , who had already been lukewarm about the operation , are getting cold feet . " the eu would have no choice but to support france , which supports deby , " said de waal .
" peacekeeping is a wonderful principle to protect african civilians , but it only works if the eu commits troops who are willing to fight and get killed . " analysts say that neither the germans nor the british are committing troops to the eu operation , partly because they suspect that france is using the eu umbrella to promote french national interests . the appointment of irishman pat nash as the mission 's commander-in-chief was not enough to convince germany to participate in a conflict dominated by the french , said dirk kohnert , an africa expert at the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg . " the french have an altruistic side , but also a very egotistical side , " said kohnert .
" france wants to be a global player outside of the eu context . " better uses of declining influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say deby offer to pardon french aid workers is tied to france 's political support france also wants to protect its export market in luxury consumer goods targeted at an extravagant african elite and french commercial interests in trading commodities , he added . chad is rich in gold , uranium and in recent years has also tapped reserves that make it an oil-exporting nation , but the french , unlike the american exxonmobil consortium , currently have virtually no oil interests in the region . marielle debos , a chad specialist at france 's elite university sciences po , however , played down the importance of economic ties . " france wants to maintain strategic and military influence in central africa , but there are no truly good reasons for french interventionist policies in central africa , " said debos . she said france could have used its influence to play a more constructive role in chad by promoting national dialogue and addressing the root causes of the current conflict . olivier thimonier , who is a spokesman for survie , a ngo that is lobbying for more democracy and human rights in africa , added that civil opposition leaders , who were unarmed and arrested during the rebellion , should be released . " if france can intervene on behalf of deby , it can also intervene to promote a more open political system , " he said .
" things are quiet in chad at the moment , but there is still unrest and anti-french sentiment below the surface .
over the long term , the solution to conflict must be political engagement , not military suppression . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

furthermore , he said , france 's influence over the deby regime is waning .

in chad , there is no middle ground .
you are either in or you are out .

" now the french government sees no alternative to supporting a despotic dictator , since the opposition is viewed as destabilizing , " said de waal . a european union force , made up largely of french troops and intended to stabilize chad 's eastern border with darfur , however , has been delayed due to rebel violence .

furthermore , he said , france 's influence over the deby regime is waning . " the reality is that the french have less real influence in central africa than ever before , " said glaser . glaser added that france would have evacuated deby when the rebels stormed the presidential palace 10 days ago , but the chadian president refused the offer and drove the opposition out with government troops .
deby 's intransigency and the strength of the resistance took the french leadership by surprise , said glaser . no political middle ground in chad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france underestimated the deby regime 's resistance to rebel and opposition groups " the french completely underestimated the backing for deby and thought the rebels would overrun the palace , " he said .

in chad , there is no middle ground .
you are either in or you are out . " only days before the rebel attack , french defense minister herve morin said that france would maintain " neutrality " in the central african country , which borders the sudanese crisis region of darfur , where refugees have been fleeing ethnic wars . france was even ready to see deby go but was surprised by his tenacity at holding on to power , said alex de waal , a program director specializing in african issues at the social science research council in new york . " now the french government sees no alternative to supporting a despotic dictator , since the opposition is viewed as destabilizing , " said de waal . a european union force , made up largely of french troops and intended to stabilize chad 's eastern border with darfur , however , has been delayed due to rebel violence .

are executives ' earnings obscene excess or legitimate incentive ?
a small-business owner in switzerland -lrb- known for being pro-business -rrb- is pushing through a referendum that would lop off the superfluous zeros . thomas minder gets a bit angry when he talks about severance packages and bonuses for managers . " those things come from the us and they 're not normal here in switzerland , " he said .
" this kind of corporate policy is sick and has to be changed . " minder , a small business owner from neuhausen am rheinfall in switzerland , has launched an initiative against exorbitant salaries for managers .
he says it 's unjust that some executives earn 600 times more than an average worker - and are even rewarded with seven-digit severance payments when they do a poor job and are dismissed . after a year and a half of campaigning , minder has nearly collected the 100,000 signatures that are necessary in switzerland for a referendum .
he and the signatories want the government to put an end to disproportionate executive salaries . salt in the wound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minder was hit hard when swiss air went bankrupt the reason behind minder 's efforts is personal .
about six years ago , swiss air placed a large order for hand lotion , lip balm and tooth paste with his small cosmetic company .
when the airline declared bankruptcy shortly thereafter , minder 's firm was stuck with a pile of toiletries and an unpaid bill . " when it came out a few months later that the ceo had gotten a settlement worth 12.5 million francs -lrb- 7.8 million euros , $ 11.4 million -rrb- , the world collapsed for us , " said minder . his campaign has hit a nerve with the swiss .
manager salaries in switzerland continue to rise disproportionately to workers ' wages - just like in germany , where the debate heated up several weeks ago . according to the investment management fund ethos , executive earnings at switzerland 's 20 largest companies rose 17 percent from 2005 to 2006 .
workers ' wages , on the other hand , only increased by 2.5 percent at most . unusual , but not unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is a direct democracy the discrepancy upsets a lot of people , said political scientist thomas milic from the university of zurich . milic , whose research focuses on public referenda , said that milic 's referendum has a chance , even though statistics suggest the contrary .
of the 200 or so petitions for referenda that have come from the swiss populace , only 15 have gone through , he said . once the 100,000 required signatures have been collected , the parliament has to put it to a public vote within three years , according to swiss law .
milic warned , though , that the government tends to water down the laws before they are voted on and present them side-by-side with counter-proposals . however , minder has the politicians on his side , too .
the social democrats , the green party and a leftist splinter party are behind his initiative ; only the right-wing swiss people 's party has n't yet taken a position . stockholders to take charge if minder 's demands are taken on by the electorate , companies listed on swiss stock exchange would have to make some changes .
the initiative calls for banning termination pay , advances and bonuses for selling or buying a company . what 's more , stockholders would determine executives ' salaries , not executives themselves .
minder aims to protect the company owners from the " boundless greed " of its executives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the chances are good for minder 's initiative still , he does n't see himself as a socialist crusader .
" i think civically and very liberally , " he said .
" the proposal is quite business friendly . " pressure from market-minded swiss wolf linder , a political scientist at the university of berne , said he did n't think minder 's proposal was business-friendly enough . " the swiss think in a much more economically liberal way than the germans , " he said .
even if it comes to a referendum , the people wo n't approve the bill , he added . still , the swiss are clearly concerned about the issue .

a small-business owner in switzerland -lrb- known for being pro-business -rrb- is pushing through a referendum that would lop off the superfluous zeros . thomas minder gets a bit angry when he talks about severance packages and bonuses for managers . " those things come from the us and they 're not normal here in switzerland , " he said .

the world bank hopes the country would be able to support itself through its coal deposits .
some economists are not convinced it will be that easy . it could all happen on february 17 .
observers are expecting kosovo to declare its independence on sunday .
independence will give the albanian majority what it has been dreaming of : secession from serbia .
however , behind all the hope and optimism which stirs in the province ahead of the declaration there is still some uncertainty over whether kosovo - known during the cold war as " yugoslavia 's poorhouse " - will be able to support itself economically as a new nation state .
even today , kosovo rates as one of the poorest regions in europe .
according to the world bank , the average annual salary for the population is 1,243 euros -lrb- $ 1,803 -rrb- .
it reports that 37 percent of the population lives in poverty and survives on less than 1.42 euros a day .
those who suffer the most are the most vulnerable : the children , old people , families without male breadwinners , the disabled , the unemployed , and the non-serbian ethnic minorities like the roma .
poverty-stricken province ignoring realities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the optimism is tempered by skepticism how can such a country survive economically ?
the skepticism increases in relation to the anticipation of imminent independence .
" the secessionists ignore the economic realities , " ruth wedgwood , a professor for international law and diplomacy at john hopkins university in baltimore , wrote in a commentary in the wall street journal on feb .
9 .
wedgwood is one of those who see kosovo as having little to gain from independence .
" kosovo has coal , lead and a workforce , but it lies in a corner of europe where only a few tourists ever go , " she wrote .
politically , she added , there is no need for kosovo to pursue independence now that slobodan milosevic is no longer in power .
franz kaps , the world bank 's special envoy to southern europe until may last year , sees things in less pessimistic terms .
now an independent advisor to the bank , kaps believes that it is kosovo 's coal reserves which will help support it through its transition to an independent state and beyond .
electricity demand a lifeline for kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's coal industry could be its economic savior southern europe , the world bank predicts , will need additional electricity of up to 4.5 gigawatts by 2012 .
kosovo sits on an estimated 15 billion tons of coal .
the potential for supply and demand is evident in these forecasted figures , but the state of kosovo 's coal industry will have to improve radically if the new state is to be the main provider of that extra power .
" if this succeeds , kosovo could even become an exporter of electricity , " kaps said .
however , the development of kosovo 's industry can only happen after political and juridical relations are made stable .
" the most important stabilization factor would be that kosovo and serbia are brought into the eu , " he added .
until kosovo gets on its feet , the country would have to rely on help from outside its new borders .
the money which flows in from kosovars in other countries is a main source of income to the province .
according to estimates , about 450 million euros per year comes in from the kosovar diaspora .
" this is the source of kosovo 's traditional economic aid , " said karl kaser , a professor for southeast-european history at the university of graz in austria .
donations and eu support could be key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo : cash donations accepted kaser can remember a time when this flow of money was even greater .
in the early 1980s , he visited the region and reported on a flow of cash coming from the north of yugoslavia to the south .
" at that time , one had the feeling that everything was improving , " said kaser .
“ everywhere there were new houses and hotels being built .
but then , in 1989 , the political problems began . "
kaser believes it will be impossible for kosovo to remain part of serbia .
a large part of kosovo 's population wants independence .
but with independence , the new country can forget about any help from belgrade .
" serbia has made it clear that it will not invest in an independent kosovo , " said kaser .
kosovo 's economic future lies with the eu and the creation of a stable government , he added .
for kosovo to develop a coal industry capable of sustaining the new country , it would need to attract foreign investors .
however , kaser fears that any investors would be in it for a fast buck and that any profits would soon be taken out of the country .
despite the uncertainty and obvious hard times ahead , kaser looks forward with optimism , and with no small amount of gallows humor , to an independent kosovo .

12 , that he believed iran was continuing to work on acquiring a nuclear weapon . " nothing that we know has changed our attitudes , " olmert told a joint press conference with german chancellor angela merkel .
" we are certain the iranians are engaged in serious clandestine operations to build an unconventional weapon , " he said .
olmert also brushed aside suggestions that iran was no longer a danger after a us intelligence report in december found that tehran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
the israeli prime minister referred to iran 's continued pursuit of uranium enrichment as justification for his country 's belief that iran was receiving nuclear fuel from russia for something other than a civilian nuclear program .
olmert said there could be no other reason for iran 's activities .
" the iranians are moving forward with their plans to create a capacity for non-conventional weapons .
there is evidence that the plan of the iranians is not that naive and innocent , " olmert said .
" this is a main challenge .
we ca n't afford to make one mistake on that issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is highly suspicious of president ahmadinejad " this is mainly the challenge of the big powers ; israel inevitably is ... very interested in these efforts and we will join forces and cooperate with our senior friends in order to help a possible solution that will deter the iranians from continuing their program , " the prime minister added .
asked whether a military response was still an option , olmert cited us president george w. bush as saying that " no option is ruled out . "
support for diplomacy merkel said germany would continue its dual strategy of pressing iran to comply with the demands of the international community on halting enrichment and of offering economic incentives if it did .
" i have said over and over again that i firmly believe in a solution by diplomatic means and that i am banking on a diplomatic solution , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel reiterated her diplomatic stance to olmert germany , along with the five permanent members of the un security council , was currently working on the text of a third resolution on iran , she noted .
olmert also spoke of the palestinian situation , saying that israel faced a " very unusual situation " in attempting to conduct negotiations while at the same time coming under attack , not only from gaza but from other parts of the palestinian territories .
the prime minister did , however , vow to fight terrorism from hamas-controlled gaza " in every possible manner " but refused to directly comment on statements made by israeli defense minister ehud barak , who indicated monday that israel might try to overthrow the hamas regime .
gaza-based terrorism " the israeli government under my leadership is absolutely determined to respond to the challenge of terrorism from gaza in every possible manner which will be effective , " olmert said at the press conference .
" we will not hesitate , we will not stop and we will do what 's necessary to be done . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could israel be preparing an offensive against hamas ?
in a veiled reference to barak 's statements , olmert said : " i know that there are lots of speculations ... discussions ... suggestions and propositions everywhere of what we can do exactly , " he added .
" that , i 'm afraid , i will not share with you . "
at the same time , he said israel " will continue our negotiations with the palestinian authority " under west bank-based president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad .
chancellor passes merkel refused to criticize israel 's current blockade of gaza and the restriction of electricity supplies .
" i know that the humanitarian situation in gaza strip is difficult , and we are trying to help in this regard where we can , " she said .
" but the simplest answer is that the targeting of the israeli state , the terrorist activities must be ended , " merkel added .
no one wanted to abuse the humanitarian situation in gaza , but it was a fact that terrorist acts were being carried out " on the backs " of the people there , she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 12.02.2008 readers oppose turkish schools in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turks in germany not to give up their ethnicity when turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan visited germany this week , he sparked discussion on integration and took heat for his proposal to start turkish schools in germany .
here 's what some dw readers had to say . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as an american who grew up in a small town with many first generation italian and greek immigrants , i am familiar with the issue of integration .
it was my experience that my contemporaries whose parents came from the " old country " spoke italian or greek at home .
they learned english from the radio , tv , playmates and school .
notwithstanding that they spoke their parents ' language at home and carried on many of the parents ' traditions , their parents encouraged them to learn american culture and to " fit in . "
they did fit in ; no one cared what they spoke at home , and today you would n't know that their parents did n't come over on the mayflower .
integration does not mean you forget where you family came from , it is adapting to where you are . - james fraser , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2.4 million turks make up the largest minority group in germany i think the turkish authorities have to understand what the german authorities are saying because every country has the way they do things .
having schools with a mother tongue in another country is far from the game .
globally , they say when in rome , do like romans , so i think if you are in germany , do like the germans . - victor c. okeke , nigeria erdogan is very much correct .
turkish people should not give up their culture and identity .
he should work to integrate as many back into turkish society as possible . - ed mueller , us the germans are out of their mind if they would allow such schools .
can you imagine germans immigrating to the us and demanding german-speaking schools ?
turks in germany must accept that they are becoming germans and if they do n't want to become germans , let them go to turkey . - peter , new zealand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before erdogan 's visit , nine turks were killed in a fire in ludwigshafen on feb .
3 the turks in germany should learn german .
they chose to live there .
if they get their own schools , they will soon want their own government , their own land , their own country within germany . - andrea weidner , us erdogan 's proposal is not only counterproductive to the goals of integration but it is an obvious indication of the goals of turkey .
turkey is unwilling to create common ground with europe .
they expect europeans to change so as to accommodate turkish demands , culture language , and laws .
it should become obvious that turkey , a nation that will not allow a greek orthodox seminary to reopen , a nation which is based on the tenant " turkey for the turks " and has systematically persecuted its minorities with discriminatory laws , can not be allowed to have a say in the lives of the people of europe . - m. g. ikossi , us i was born turkey but have lived in the us for 48 years .
here , americans complain that spanish-speaking immigrants do not know english .
when you are in the us , you should learn english right away .
if parents do not know the new language and want their children to know their mother language , this is understandable , but these kids are going to live in us -lrb- or germany -rrb- .
they have to compete with germans or americans .
today i see turkish kids in germany who can not speak decent german .
when turks complain that their children can not go to high school and college , what do they expect ?
now erdogan wants germany to have turkish middle schools .
if german does that , i really do not know what to say . - engin sor , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as an american who grew up in a small town with many first generation italian and greek immigrants , i am familiar with the issue of integration .
it was my experience that my contemporaries whose parents came from the " old country " spoke italian or greek at home .
they learned english from the radio , tv , playmates and school .
notwithstanding that they spoke their parents ' language at home and carried on many of the parents ' traditions , their parents encouraged them to learn american culture and to " fit in . "
they did fit in ; no one cared what they spoke at home , and today you would n't know that their parents did n't come over on the mayflower .
integration does not mean you forget where you family came from , it is adapting to where you are . - james fraser , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2.4 million turks make up the largest minority group in germany i think the turkish authorities have to understand what the german authorities are saying because every country has the way they do things .
having schools with a mother tongue in another country is far from the game .
globally , they say when in rome , do like romans , so i think if you are in germany , do like the germans . - victor c. okeke , nigeria erdogan is very much correct .
turkish people should not give up their culture and identity .
he should work to integrate as many back into turkish society as possible . - ed mueller , us the germans are out of their mind if they would allow such schools .
can you imagine germans immigrating to the us and demanding german-speaking schools ?
turks in germany must accept that they are becoming germans and if they do n't want to become germans , let them go to turkey . - peter , new zealand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before erdogan 's visit , nine turks were killed in a fire in ludwigshafen on feb .
3 the turks in germany should learn german .
they chose to live there .
if they get their own schools , they will soon want their own government , their own land , their own country within germany . - andrea weidner , us erdogan 's proposal is not only counterproductive to the goals of integration but it is an obvious indication of the goals of turkey .
turkey is unwilling to create common ground with europe .
they expect europeans to change so as to accommodate turkish demands , culture language , and laws .
it should become obvious that turkey , a nation that will not allow a greek orthodox seminary to reopen , a nation which is based on the tenant " turkey for the turks " and has systematically persecuted its minorities with discriminatory laws , can not be allowed to have a say in the lives of the people of europe . - m. g. ikossi , us i was born turkey but have lived in the us for 48 years .
here , americans complain that spanish-speaking immigrants do not know english .
when you are in the us , you should learn english right away .
if parents do not know the new language and want their children to know their mother language , this is understandable , but these kids are going to live in us -lrb- or germany -rrb- .
they have to compete with germans or americans .
today i see turkish kids in germany who can not speak decent german .
when turks complain that their children can not go to high school and college , what do they expect ?

massive numbers of germany fans have been clamoring for euro 2008 tickets since the lottery process started in earnest .
unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far . the swiss and austrian organizers of euro 2008 may be taking a page out of germany 's book when it comes to trying to emulate the success of the world cup two years ago , but it seems that the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- itself has forgotten one of its main mistakes from 2006 . while the world cup in germany has been lauded as one of the most successfully organized global soccer events in modern history , one of the few aspects to cause chaos and consternation was the allocation of tickets . the complicated online lottery process , the exorbitant prices , the credit card monopolies and the minute numbers of tickets actually available to the everyday fan were just some of the complaints that dogged the almost-perfect tournament .
two years on , the dfb looks to have forgotten the stress and strain german fans went through to see their team play international soccer . a staggering 1.5 million tickets were requested by germany fans for the 14,400 available for their country 's three euro 2008 pool games in austria , the dfb said on wednesday , feb .
13 .
applications , whcih the dfb called " overwhelming , " closed at midnight on tuesday , leaving fans of joachim loew 's boys were again facing heartbreak . german fans destined for ticket disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niersbach had to try and rob goleo to get a world cup ticket " it seems to be german fans ' mission impossible to get tickets for euro 2008 , " dfb secretary-general wolfgang niersbuch said .
" unfortunately , there will be only a few joyful winners and it is a pity we have so few tickets to give away in a drawing which will take place at the end of the month . " the dfb , he admitted , was only handing over 14,400 of the 21,765 tickets it has to fans . " we also have to give tickets to our committees , the bundesliga clubs , the regional organizations , our sponsors and the players ' families get an allocation too , " niersbuch said . after the success of the 2006 world cup , the demand for germany 's first round matches against poland -lrb- june 8 -rrb- and croatia -lrb- june 12 -rrb- in the southern austrian city of klagenfurt , plus the clash with hosts austria in vienna -lrb- june 16 -rrb- , has gone through the roof . but the dfb can not be held fully responsible for the imminent distress .
some of the venues for the european championships are less than equipped for dealing with fans ' demands than the ticket allocation process itself . for example , germany 's potential group deciding clash against croatia in klagenfurt takes place in the 32,000-capacity hypo group arena , a stadium much smaller than many bundesliga venues . black market preparing for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rival fans may end up together with black market tickets for the two games in klagenfurt , the dfb gets 5,722 tickets per game with 10,321 available for the game against austria at the ernst happel stadium , which has a capacity of 50,000 . the result could see huge numbers of fans descending on the venues ahead of the games willing to part company with large sums of cash for tickets in various areas of the arenas , leading to security issues . with games against bitter rivals poland , notoriously volatile croatia and neighbors austria , placing germany fans in opposition blocks is something the authorities will want to avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far . the swiss and austrian organizers of euro 2008 may be taking a page out of germany 's book when it comes to trying to emulate the success of the world cup two years ago , but it seems that the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- itself has forgotten one of its main mistakes from 2006 . while the world cup in germany has been lauded as one of the most successfully organized global soccer events in modern history , one of the few aspects to cause chaos and consternation was the allocation of tickets . the complicated online lottery process , the exorbitant prices , the credit card monopolies and the minute numbers of tickets actually available to the everyday fan were just some of the complaints that dogged the almost-perfect tournament .
two years on , the dfb looks to have forgotten the stress and strain german fans went through to see their team play international soccer . a staggering 1.5 million tickets were requested by germany fans for the 14,400 available for their country 's three euro 2008 pool games in austria , the dfb said on wednesday , feb .
13 .
applications , whcih the dfb called " overwhelming , " closed at midnight on tuesday , leaving fans of joachim loew 's boys were again facing heartbreak . german fans destined for ticket disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niersbach had to try and rob goleo to get a world cup ticket " it seems to be german fans ' mission impossible to get tickets for euro 2008 , " dfb secretary-general wolfgang niersbuch said .
" unfortunately , there will be only a few joyful winners and it is a pity we have so few tickets to give away in a drawing which will take place at the end of the month . " the dfb , he admitted , was only handing over 14,400 of the 21,765 tickets it has to fans . " we also have to give tickets to our committees , the bundesliga clubs , the regional organizations , our sponsors and the players ' families get an allocation too , " niersbuch said . after the success of the 2006 world cup , the demand for germany 's first round matches against poland -lrb- june 8 -rrb- and croatia -lrb- june 12 -rrb- in the southern austrian city of klagenfurt , plus the clash with hosts austria in vienna -lrb- june 16 -rrb- , has gone through the roof . but the dfb can not be held fully responsible for the imminent distress .
some of the venues for the european championships are less than equipped for dealing with fans ' demands than the ticket allocation process itself . for example , germany 's potential group deciding clash against croatia in klagenfurt takes place in the 32,000-capacity hypo group arena , a stadium much smaller than many bundesliga venues . black market preparing for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rival fans may end up together with black market tickets for the two games in klagenfurt , the dfb gets 5,722 tickets per game with 10,321 available for the game against austria at the ernst happel stadium , which has a capacity of 50,000 . the result could see huge numbers of fans descending on the venues ahead of the games willing to part company with large sums of cash for tickets in various areas of the arenas , leading to security issues . with games against bitter rivals poland , notoriously volatile croatia and neighbors austria , placing germany fans in opposition blocks is something the authorities will want to avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs made in germany video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / dw-tv arabia : made in germany question of the week -pipe- 12.02.2008 on the subject of investment strategy - how do you make your money work for you ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors are worried and confidence in banks has been shaken .
what do you think ?
are stock markets still a safe place to invest or is it better to put cash in an equity fund ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : arthur k. age : 33 occupation : accountant city / country : kampala , uganda i invest my money in unit trusts which has several portfolios like the money fund , balanaced investment scheme and high yield fund .
this ensures that i get a high return of say between 7-9 % as compared to the bank rates of 6 % p.a.
the unit trust caters for small investors like myself as you do n't need alot of money to make an investment .
besides since unit trust involve alot of many small investors pooling funds together , the impact of the chargers is not felt greatly by one individual as compared to bank accounts were the chargers are borne by the account holder .
in uganda some of the chargers include 15 % withholding tax and the bank service chargers .
incase of unit trusts these charges are shared equally among the investors thus increasing the value of return on investment .
i am also charged about 2.5 % on initial investment but that compared to the many hidden costs bank charged is a fair deal .
the 6 % interest or return banks offer is way below the 9-10 % inflation rate experienced annually in our economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : juan pablo cardona r. age : 32 occupation : production engineer city / country : medellin , colombia regardless if you are a risk-averse investor or a risk lover , i think the best strategy is : - use diversification , mix risk-free with risky investments . - read economical and political news . - use hedging vehicles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohammed a. age : 23 occupation : financial analyst city / country : riyhad , saudi arabia i would put my money on realestate .
in my country it is a very low risk investment as the demand is booming and it gives very good returns .
my other alternative is to invest in a small business like a resturant or so .
investing in shares is very risky and most people loose money because it is difficult to know when to stop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : carolina v. age : 21 occupation : college graduate city / country : bulacan , philippines people are usually invest their savings on several insurance esp. educational , pension , accident , etc .
however , it may be risky and i could never tell whether it is secured and safe or not due to bankruptcy and corruption ...
as my mom told us ever before when my sister planned to have an educational plan for my younger brother who was born 6 years ago .
so , our family decided to keep our savings and incomes deposited in our several bank accounts and one of those accounts is for my brother 's future tuition fees because he will be nearly grade 1 student this june after finishing his kindergarten course .
and for myself ... as long as i 'm still single and family-dependent , if i have already got my very first salary from my very first job -lrb- hoping ... -rrb- , i 'd rather contribute to our family income to support ourselves and the remaining part is for my own personal debts and savings ... even my future use ...
i was planning to study again as i want to pursue a master 's degree ...
now , in my general opinion , money can do anything .
once we have it , we can use it ... we can spend and invest everything such as " paluwagan " -lrb- filipino term for ... some kinda ... investment between friends or relatives -rrb- and having business as my former college professors did 1 1/2 years ago as they sell dimsums and drinks .
it 's better to do it ... but , the most important is to make it sure that this kind of investment should be in a right time and place . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit wirtschaft we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

but the debate over whether scientology is a sect or a genuine religion is sure to continue . an administrative appellate court in muenster handed down the verdict in the case , brought by the scientology organization , which challenged an early decision allowing government surveillance . the muenster judges found that the federal office for the protection of the constitution was within its authority to keep scientologists under observation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of a new scientology center in berlin last year stirred controversy in the statement announcing the verdict , the court said that there were " numerous indications " that the scientology organization promoted a form of society " in which central constitutional values such as the dignity of mankind and the right to equal treatment would be suspended or restricted . " " in particular , there is the suspicion that in a scientological society only scientologists would enjoy civil rights , " the court decided . the office for the protection of the constitution , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , has had scientology under surveillance since 1997 . misunderstood faith or public hazard ? the organization itself argued that it is a religious association that does not pursue political goals in the sense of the laws established to protect germany 's constitution . but the court rejected the argument , deeming it irrelevant to a case for or against surveillance . germany officially considers scientology a business rather than a religion .
no charges have ever been brought as a result of government surveillance . nonetheless , the court said the scientology movement was " trying to expand personally and to spread scientological principles more and more within government , the economy and society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor tom cruise is one of the movement 's most prominent members scientology was set up by author l. ron hubbard in 1954 in the united states .
the organization 's official web site describes its aims as seeking " only evolution to higher states of being for the individual and for society . " the german court also heard testimony concerning a number of anti-democratic remarks made by hubbard .
the court found that no evidence of the movement distancing itself from those opinions . the church of scientology says it will appeal the ruling and called for an end to the surveillance . " the german federal office for the protection of the constitution should finally end this farce and turn its attention to real enemies of the constitution and real danger so as to do what it is there for : to protect the german constitution and the basic rights of the people , " the organization said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i can tell that things have become more expensive overall , but not too much ; it 's just the normal kind of inflation process for most products . it 's hard for me to tell because i often have the impression that they randomly make some products more expensive in small shops , the kind of shops where i go .
if a product sells well , for example , and that 's because they know that the people who live here are tied to them so they can afford to lift prices sometimes .
i buy sardines very often and i can see they are popular in this particular shop because they have more and more kinds , and they 're more expensive in a very obvious way .
so we 're talking about a store that can afford to manipulate prices because they 're the only one around here - and it 's difficult to set up a shop in the old town . how easy is it for you to get by ? i earn a rather high wage so i certainly do n't struggle .
but i 'm also lucky because i own an apartment and do n't have to pay a mortgage .
i think most people who are in my income bracket with a steady job will very often be burdened by a mortgage , which might mean they sometimes have problems .
i 'm lucky enough to have this apartment that was given to me by my dad .
i earn well and i have a rather wealthy family .
i might not be the most representative consumer . what about for most people in poland is it easy for them to get by financially ? it depends .

but the debate over whether scientology is a sect or a genuine religion is sure to continue . an administrative appellate court in muenster handed down the verdict in the case , brought by the scientology organization , which challenged an early decision allowing government surveillance . the muenster judges found that the federal office for the protection of the constitution was within its authority to keep scientologists under observation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of a new scientology center in berlin last year stirred controversy in the statement announcing the verdict , the court said that there were " numerous indications " that the scientology organization promoted a form of society " in which central constitutional values such as the dignity of mankind and the right to equal treatment would be suspended or restricted . " " in particular , there is the suspicion that in a scientological society only scientologists would enjoy civil rights , " the court decided . the office for the protection of the constitution , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , has had scientology under surveillance since 1997 . misunderstood faith or public hazard ? the organization itself argued that it is a religious association that does not pursue political goals in the sense of the laws established to protect germany 's constitution . but the court rejected the argument , deeming it irrelevant to a case for or against surveillance . germany officially considers scientology a business rather than a religion .
no charges have ever been brought as a result of government surveillance . nonetheless , the court said the scientology movement was " trying to expand personally and to spread scientological principles more and more within government , the economy and society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor tom cruise is one of the movement 's most prominent members scientology was set up by author l. ron hubbard in 1954 in the united states .
the organization 's official web site describes its aims as seeking " only evolution to higher states of being for the individual and for society . " the german court also heard testimony concerning a number of anti-democratic remarks made by hubbard .
the court found that no evidence of the movement distancing itself from those opinions . the church of scientology says it will appeal the ruling and called for an end to the surveillance . " the german federal office for the protection of the constitution should finally end this farce and turn its attention to real enemies of the constitution and real danger so as to do what it is there for : to protect the german constitution and the basic rights of the people , " the organization said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

massive numbers of germany fans have been clamoring for euro 2008 tickets since the lottery process started in earnest .
unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far . the swiss and austrian organizers of euro 2008 may be taking a page out of germany 's book when it comes to trying to emulate the success of the world cup two years ago , but it seems that the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- itself has forgotten one of its main mistakes from 2006 . while the world cup in germany has been lauded as one of the most successfully organized global soccer events in modern history , one of the few aspects to cause chaos and consternation was the allocation of tickets . the complicated online lottery process , the exorbitant prices , the credit card monopolies and the minute numbers of tickets actually available to the everyday fan were just some of the complaints that dogged the almost-perfect tournament .
two years on , the dfb looks to have forgotten the stress and strain german fans went through to see their team play international soccer . a staggering 1.5 million tickets were requested by germany fans for the 14,400 available for their country 's three euro 2008 pool games in austria , the dfb said on wednesday , feb .
13 .
applications , whcih the dfb called " overwhelming , " closed at midnight on tuesday , leaving fans of joachim loew 's boys were again facing heartbreak . german fans destined for ticket disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niersbach had to try and rob goleo to get a world cup ticket " it seems to be german fans ' mission impossible to get tickets for euro 2008 , " dfb secretary-general wolfgang niersbuch said .
" unfortunately , there will be only a few joyful winners and it is a pity we have so few tickets to give away in a drawing which will take place at the end of the month . " the dfb , he admitted , was only handing over 14,400 of the 21,765 tickets it has to fans . " we also have to give tickets to our committees , the bundesliga clubs , the regional organizations , our sponsors and the players ' families get an allocation too , " niersbuch said . after the success of the 2006 world cup , the demand for germany 's first round matches against poland -lrb- june 8 -rrb- and croatia -lrb- june 12 -rrb- in the southern austrian city of klagenfurt , plus the clash with hosts austria in vienna -lrb- june 16 -rrb- , has gone through the roof . but the dfb can not be held fully responsible for the imminent distress .
some of the venues for the european championships are less than equipped for dealing with fans ' demands than the ticket allocation process itself . for example , germany 's potential group deciding clash against croatia in klagenfurt takes place in the 32,000-capacity hypo group arena , a stadium much smaller than many bundesliga venues . black market preparing for euro 2008 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rival fans may end up together with black market tickets for the two games in klagenfurt , the dfb gets 5,722 tickets per game with 10,321 available for the game against austria at the ernst happel stadium , which has a capacity of 50,000 . the result could see huge numbers of fans descending on the venues ahead of the games willing to part company with large sums of cash for tickets in various areas of the arenas , leading to security issues . with games against bitter rivals poland , notoriously volatile croatia and neighbors austria , placing germany fans in opposition blocks is something the authorities will want to avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 12.02.2008 readers oppose turkish schools in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turks in germany not to give up their ethnicity when turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan visited germany this week , he sparked discussion on integration and took heat for his proposal to start turkish schools in germany .
here 's what some dw readers had to say . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as an american who grew up in a small town with many first generation italian and greek immigrants , i am familiar with the issue of integration .
it was my experience that my contemporaries whose parents came from the " old country " spoke italian or greek at home .
they learned english from the radio , tv , playmates and school .
notwithstanding that they spoke their parents ' language at home and carried on many of the parents ' traditions , their parents encouraged them to learn american culture and to " fit in . "
they did fit in ; no one cared what they spoke at home , and today you would n't know that their parents did n't come over on the mayflower .
integration does not mean you forget where you family came from , it is adapting to where you are . - james fraser , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2.4 million turks make up the largest minority group in germany i think the turkish authorities have to understand what the german authorities are saying because every country has the way they do things .
having schools with a mother tongue in another country is far from the game .
globally , they say when in rome , do like romans , so i think if you are in germany , do like the germans . - victor c. okeke , nigeria erdogan is very much correct .
turkish people should not give up their culture and identity .
he should work to integrate as many back into turkish society as possible . - ed mueller , us the germans are out of their mind if they would allow such schools .
can you imagine germans immigrating to the us and demanding german-speaking schools ?
turks in germany must accept that they are becoming germans and if they do n't want to become germans , let them go to turkey . - peter , new zealand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before erdogan 's visit , nine turks were killed in a fire in ludwigshafen on feb .
3 the turks in germany should learn german .
they chose to live there .
if they get their own schools , they will soon want their own government , their own land , their own country within germany . - andrea weidner , us erdogan 's proposal is not only counterproductive to the goals of integration but it is an obvious indication of the goals of turkey .
turkey is unwilling to create common ground with europe .
they expect europeans to change so as to accommodate turkish demands , culture language , and laws .
it should become obvious that turkey , a nation that will not allow a greek orthodox seminary to reopen , a nation which is based on the tenant " turkey for the turks " and has systematically persecuted its minorities with discriminatory laws , can not be allowed to have a say in the lives of the people of europe . - m. g. ikossi , us i was born turkey but have lived in the us for 48 years .
here , americans complain that spanish-speaking immigrants do not know english .
when you are in the us , you should learn english right away .
if parents do not know the new language and want their children to know their mother language , this is understandable , but these kids are going to live in us -lrb- or germany -rrb- .
they have to compete with germans or americans .
today i see turkish kids in germany who can not speak decent german .
when turks complain that their children can not go to high school and college , what do they expect ?
now erdogan wants germany to have turkish middle schools .
if german does that , i really do not know what to say . - engin sor , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for just £ 15 a month minimum donation , members receive a newsletter and a free ticket to its annual dinner .
men get a tie with " england expects " - the first two words of nelson 's rallying signal at the battle - emblazoned on it while women receive a personal organiser .
the club could be a gathering of naval historical enthusiasts - the reality is different .
those who attend the annual dinner are addressed by nick griffin , chairman and leading light of the british national party .
' elite fund-raisers ' billed on the party 's website as its " elite fund raising group " , the club is a channel for well-heeled bnp supporters to give financial aid to the party without having to be listed as an official donor .
the website tells would-be members : " you do not need to be a member of the british national party to join the trafalgar club .
" the government currently bans many civil servants from joining the bnp so the trafalgar club is a great way of demonstrating your patriotism and making sure you keep your job . "
it adds : " after many years of running on shoe-string budgets , the bnp has learned how to stretch a pound as far as it will go ! "
however , a bbc file on 4 investigation has heard other claims about the party 's finances .
the bnp denies it has broken party funding rules former party treasurer john brayshaw refused to sign off the party 's accounts because he claims he was not given the access to all the records he needed to see .
in 2005 he wrote to the electoral commission , the body which oversees political party finances , saying that he resigned as bnp treasurer .
he alleged a number of irregularities had come to light including missing invoices and receipts from the trafalgar club .
in his letter , mr brayshaw said current party treasurer john walker and his deputy david hannam visited his home for a week to complete the accounts .
he said he did not help them but claimed he witnessed some unusual activities , namely the shredding of a large number of documents and invoices .
mr brayshaw said he was told to burn the shredded documents , but kept them because he felt something improper had taken place .
a black bin bag containing the documents has been handed to file on 4 .
it contains fragments of cheques , train tickets , receipts and invoices .
some of the fragments carry the names of nick griffin , his parents and even the trafalgar club .
what you 've got in front of me here is clearly very weak evidence and the bbc is clutching at straws john walker , bnp treasurer one unshredded item is a petrol receipt with the name excalibur - the title of the party 's merchandising arm .
under tax regulations all financial records should be kept for six years .
the electoral commission said it had no reason to believe a breach of the party funding law had taken place .
current bnp treasurer john walker dismissed mr brayshaw 's allegations as pure fantasy .
he said mr brayshaw had failed to make the books balance and had left the party 's accounts in a mess .
mr walker said the shredded material included material such as " draft accounts that may have errors in dates and things like that .
because you are trying to reconcile the accounts , of course you shred documents . "
documents john brayshaw claims he was ordered to shred have been handed to file on 4 confronted by the bbc with some of the shredded material , mr walker said they contained working copies of printouts of the bnp accounts and bounced cheques .
he added : " what you 've got in front of me here is clearly very weak evidence and the bbc is clutching at straws . "
among other questions raised by file on 4 are whether the bnp breached party funding rules by not declaring the name of a donor who gave £ 20,000 to the party .
the rules say all donors who give more than £ 5,000 should be identified .
when leader nick griffin was cleared of race hate charges in november 2006 , he claimed the party had just received its largest ever donation .
bnp member sharon ebanks told the bbc she was personally thanked by a party official for collecting the £ 20,000 donation via her internet fund-raising .
what this investigation for file on 4 is identifying is much more significant that any of the charges i was laying before the parliament , namely a systematic series of financial irregularities jon cruddas , mp ms ebanks told file on 4 that the party informed her the donor 's cheque was genuine and he should be made an honorary life member .
the bnp strenuously denies that it has broken any rules .
it claims that the cheque in fact bounced and therefore did not need to be declared .
labour mp for dagenham jon cruddas has already raised the issue of bnp finances in parliament , and presented the electoral commission with a 20-page dossier just before christmas .
he said : " what this investigation for file on 4 is identifying is much more significant than any of the charges i was laying before the parliament - namely a systematic series of financial irregularities .
" and this can not be laid to rest without the most thorough of investigations by the electoral commission . "

current bnp treasurer john walker dismissed mr brayshaw 's allegations as pure fantasy .
he said mr brayshaw had failed to make the books balance and had left the party 's accounts in a mess .
mr walker said the shredded material included material such as " draft accounts that may have errors in dates and things like that .
because you are trying to reconcile the accounts , of course you shred documents . "
documents john brayshaw claims he was ordered to shred have been handed to file on 4 confronted by the bbc with some of the shredded material , mr walker said they contained working copies of printouts of the bnp accounts and bounced cheques .
he added : " what you 've got in front of me here is clearly very weak evidence and the bbc is clutching at straws . "
among other questions raised by file on 4 are whether the bnp breached party funding rules by not declaring the name of a donor who gave £ 20,000 to the party .
the rules say all donors who give more than £ 5,000 should be identified .
when leader nick griffin was cleared of race hate charges in november 2006 , he claimed the party had just received its largest ever donation .
bnp member sharon ebanks told the bbc she was personally thanked by a party official for collecting the £ 20,000 donation via her internet fund-raising .
what this investigation for file on 4 is identifying is much more significant that any of the charges i was laying before the parliament , namely a systematic series of financial irregularities jon cruddas , mp ms ebanks told file on 4 that the party informed her the donor 's cheque was genuine and he should be made an honorary life member .
the bnp strenuously denies that it has broken any rules .
it claims that the cheque in fact bounced and therefore did not need to be declared .
labour mp for dagenham jon cruddas has already raised the issue of bnp finances in parliament , and presented the electoral commission with a 20-page dossier just before christmas .
he said : " what this investigation for file on 4 is identifying is much more significant than any of the charges i was laying before the parliament - namely a systematic series of financial irregularities .
" and this can not be laid to rest without the most thorough of investigations by the electoral commission . "

double oscar winner hilary swank will reportedly play legendary aviator amelia earhart in the biopic .
in 1928 she touched down in burry port in carmarthenshire after a 21-hour flight from newfoundland .
earhart enthusiast and local councillor les george said he was sure filmmakers " would be welcomed with open arms " if they chose to shoot in the town .
hollywood trade paper variety says swank , who won best actress oscars for 2004 's million dollar baby , directed by clint eastwood , and 1999 's boys do n't cry , will play earhart in the formative stages of her career .
the film , amelia , which according to the paper will get off the ground in april , is being directed by mira nair and produced by avalon pictures .
mr george said : " i would be delighted to see a film because it 's a lovely story and it would be a wonderful thing for burry port . "
they thought they were flying up the english channel when in fact hey were on the loughor estuary " les george " we are very very proud of the fact she landed here and if they were to film here i 'm sure they would be welcomed with open arms . "
earhart , pilot wilbur stultz and mechanic louis gordon were greeted as heroes after their sea plane , the friendship , touched down on 18 june , 1928 .
but mr george said it came as a surprise to them as their intended destination was southampton .
" although it was a long summer night there was a lot of low cloud .
they thought they were flying up the english channel when in fact they were on the loughor estuary .
they had one hell of a shock . "
news of the flight was reported around the world , with journalists sent from london to the small town .
" people came from everywhere .
she stayed the night in the ashburnham hotel and then carried on to southampton the following day , " he added .
but mr george said it was not the first time there had been talk of making a hollywood film about the flight .
" going back some time ago a lady came to see me because annette bening and her husband warren beatty were thinking of filming the story . "
he said while the harbour where the plane was moored had been developed there was a nearby dock that still looked as it did 80 years ago .
" i 'm sure they could make it look as it did back then , and i 'm sure there would be no shortage of people willing to turn out dressed as they did in the 1920s as extras . "
carmarthenshire council said it would be more than happy to help accommodate filming .
executive board member clive scourfield said : " it would be fabulous if her association with the town is marked in the proposed film because it made world-wide history .
" the council would be delighted to help even if it meant allowing part of the inner dock or sections of the harbour to be used in the re-enactment of that historic day . "

carmarthenshire council said it would be more than happy to help accommodate filming .
executive board member clive scourfield said : " it would be fabulous if her association with the town is marked in the proposed film because it made world-wide history .
" the council would be delighted to help even if it meant allowing part of the inner dock or sections of the harbour to be used in the re-enactment of that historic day . "

double oscar winner hilary swank will reportedly play legendary aviator amelia earhart in the biopic .
in 1928 she touched down in burry port in carmarthenshire after a 21-hour flight from newfoundland .
earhart enthusiast and local councillor les george said he was sure filmmakers " would be welcomed with open arms " if they chose to shoot in the town .
hollywood trade paper variety says swank , who won best actress oscars for 2004 's million dollar baby , directed by clint eastwood , and 1999 's boys do n't cry , will play earhart in the formative stages of her career .
the film , amelia , which according to the paper will get off the ground in april , is being directed by mira nair and produced by avalon pictures .
mr george said : " i would be delighted to see a film because it 's a lovely story and it would be a wonderful thing for burry port .
they thought they were flying up the english channel when in fact hey were on the loughor estuary les george " we are very very proud of the fact she landed here and if they were to film here i 'm sure they would be welcomed with open arms . "
earhart , pilot wilbur stultz and mechanic louis gordon were greeted as heroes after their sea plane , the friendship , touched down on 18 june , 1928 .
but mr george said it came as a surprise to them as their intended destination was southampton .
" although it was a long summer night there was a lot of low cloud .
they thought they were flying up the english channel when in fact they were on the loughor estuary .
they had one hell of a shock . "
news of the flight was reported around the world , with journalists sent from london to the small town .
" people came from everywhere .
she stayed the night in the ashburnham hotel and then carried on to southampton the following day , " he added .
but mr george said it was not the first time there had been talk of making a hollywood film about the flight .
" going back some time ago a lady came to see me because annette bening and her husband warren beatty were thinking of filming the story . "
he said while the harbour where the plane was moored had been developed there was a nearby dock that still looked as it did 80 years ago .
" i 'm sure they could make it look as it did back then , and i 'm sure there would be no shortage of people willing to turn out dressed as they did in the 1920s as extras . "
carmarthenshire council said it would be more than happy to help accommodate filming .
executive board member clive scourfield said : " it would be fabulous if her association with the town is marked in the proposed film because it made world-wide history .
" the council would be delighted to help even if it meant allowing part of the inner dock or sections of the harbour to be used in the re-enactment of that historic day . "

the bbc 's gabriel gatehouse reports from ukraine 's southern region on how kiev 's ambition to join nato is affecting the two neighbours .
uneasy neighbours : russian and ukrainian ships docked together take a trip across sevastopol harbour , and you will see ukrainian battleships at anchor side-by-side with those of the russian black sea fleet : two navies next to each other , like long-time but somewhat uneasy neighbours .
the prospect of ukraine joining nato may still be a decade or more away , but it worries the russian defence ministry .
since the end of the cold war , nato has expanded right up to russia 's borders , taking in countries such as the baltic states that were formerly part of the soviet union .
but for russia , ukraine is a special case , not least because of the presence of the black sea fleet in ukrainian waters .
on board the ukrainian navy 's flagship , the hetman sahaidachnyi , vice admiral ihor tenyukh talks a lot about the bond all sailors feel , regardless of the country they serve .
but when it comes to russia 's fears about nato , he is unmoved .
vice admiral tenyukh looks to the west , like many ukrainians " it 's not my job to reassure or persuade , that 's the job of other government departments , " he says .
" i think every country must decide on its own direction .
ukraine decided long ago to integrate with europe .
these decisions are perfectly logical , and nato is an important step on the way to membership of the european union . "
in the aftermath of the collapse of the ussr , moscow struck a deal with kiev : the russian black sea fleet could stay in a port that now belonged to ukraine .
that deal , though , came at a price - some $ 100m a year , and the political uncertainty of having to rely on the goodwill of a foreign government .
and for many ukrainians , like local mp volodymyr arabadzhy , the presence of the russian fleet creates a stark dilemma .
" if we go towards nato , the russian fleet will have to leave sevastopol .
if the russian fleet is in sevastopol , ukraine can not be in nato , " he says .
like many crimeans , he feels a strong attachment to the black sea fleet .
" our people in sevastopol have many traditions - mostly close to the navy fleet , because sevastopol was born as a naval base 225 years ago . "
strategic hotspot the russian navy 's presence in sevastopol goes far beyond ships and submarines .
they have a whole infrastructure , with their own doctors in their own hospitals .
even their own schools .
and that infrastructure creates employment .
local officials estimate that some 20,000 ukrainians rely on the black sea fleet for their jobs .
the local economy relies on the russian fleet " if the russian armed forces left , this town would be finished , " says natalia , a local shopkeeper .
" there are so many areas like this one where everyone , all the shops , survive on the russian military .
if they left , that would be the end of us .
we 'd be left out on the streets , without work . "
it is hardly surprising then that many in sevastopol see russia as a friend , and nato as a threat .
not far from sevastopol is the small town of balaclava .
like many places in the region , it has a long history of conflict between russia and the west .
during the crimean war , the british based their fleet in balaclava .
then around 100 years later , the soviets built an underground submarine bunker here .
until the end of the cold war , it was classified as top secret .
ukrainians face a dilemma over the future of sevastopol these days , it is a museum .
but , says director oleh kharievsky , when it comes to nato , many people 's attitudes remain unchanged .
" many people here have seen the enemy , not just through the lens of a camera , but down the barrel of a gun .
so it 's pretty obvious that those people 's view of nato has n't changed in 30 or 40 years . "
after the upheavals of the 1990s , russia is reasserting itself on the international stage , and it sees the military as an important part of that resurgence .
in january , the flagship of the black sea fleet was sent to lead the country 's first large-scale exercises in the atlantic for 15 years .
russia 's lease in sevastopol runs out in 2017 , and the current ukrainian government has made it clear it is not keen to renew .
the russians , though , will not want to give up the southern port without a fight .
ukraine may be hoping that closer integration with nato might persuade them to change their minds .

that deal , though , came at a price - some $ 100m a year , and the political uncertainty of having to rely on the goodwill of a foreign government .
and for many ukrainians , like local mp volodymyr arabadzhy , the presence of the russian fleet creates a stark dilemma .
" if we go towards nato , the russian fleet will have to leave sevastopol .
if the russian fleet is in sevastopol , ukraine can not be in nato , " he says .
like many crimeans , he feels a strong attachment to the black sea fleet .
" our people in sevastopol have many traditions - mostly close to the navy fleet , because sevastopol was born as a naval base 225 years ago . "
strategic hotspot the russian navy 's presence in sevastopol goes far beyond ships and submarines .
they have a whole infrastructure , with their own doctors in their own hospitals .
even their own schools .
and that infrastructure creates employment .
local officials estimate that some 20,000 ukrainians rely on the black sea fleet for their jobs .
the local economy relies on the russian fleet " if the russian armed forces left , this town would be finished , " says natalia , a local shopkeeper .
" there are so many areas like this one where everyone , all the shops , survive on the russian military .
if they left , that would be the end of us .
we 'd be left out on the streets , without work . "
it is hardly surprising then that many in sevastopol see russia as a friend , and nato as a threat .
not far from sevastopol is the small town of balaclava .
like many places in the region , it has a long history of conflict between russia and the west .
during the crimean war , the british based their fleet in balaclava .
then around 100 years later , the soviets built an underground submarine bunker here .
until the end of the cold war , it was classified as top secret .
ukrainians face a dilemma over the future of sevastopol these days , it is a museum .
but , says director oleh kharievsky , when it comes to nato , many people 's attitudes remain unchanged .
" many people here have seen the enemy , not just through the lens of a camera , but down the barrel of a gun .
so it 's pretty obvious that those people 's view of nato has n't changed in 30 or 40 years . "
after the upheavals of the 1990s , russia is reasserting itself on the international stage , and it sees the military as an important part of that resurgence .
in january , the flagship of the black sea fleet was sent to lead the country 's first large-scale exercises in the atlantic for 15 years .
russia 's lease in sevastopol runs out in 2017 , and the current ukrainian government has made it clear it is not keen to renew .
the russians , though , will not want to give up the southern port without a fight .
ukraine may be hoping that closer integration with nato might persuade them to change their minds .

a save the children report found that for more than a quarter of children , poverty is a short-term issue - but for 21 % , it is a long-term experience .
researcher marina monteith said living in poverty for years was likely to be much more serious than experiencing poverty on a more temporary basis .
she said there were " high levels of stress " in such households .
" persistent poverty impacts adversely on the experience of childhood and life chances are reduced - in terms of educational opportunities as well as health and well-being , " she said .
" in addition , children living in persistent poverty are living in households where parents are clearly experiencing high levels of stress and struggling to cope . "
the research - persistent child poverty in northern ireland - was carried out by save the children in partnership with ark , the northern ireland social and political archive .
the introduction of the northern ireland household panel -lrb- nihps -rrb- survey in 2001 has allowed analysts to study the duration of child poverty .
research director at ark katrina lloyd said the same people are followed up each year .
" this enables researchers to study how their circumstances change over the four year period for which data is available -lrb- 2001-2004 -rrb- .
" using this information , we are able to study whether child poverty is short-term or persistent - that is , being poor for at least three of the four years .
she said those most affected by persistent poverty were children living in families dependent mainly on benefits , children living with a lone parent and children living in families with a disabled or elderly adult or a disabled child .
" furthermore , the analysis showed that parents of children living in poverty had poorer mental health and that mental health and well-being was worst for mothers of children living in persistent poverty , " she said .

" using this information , we are able to study whether child poverty is short-term or persistent - that is , being poor for at least three of the four years .
she said those most affected by persistent poverty were children living in families dependent mainly on benefits , children living with a lone parent and children living in families with a disabled or elderly adult or a disabled child .
" furthermore , the analysis showed that parents of children living in poverty had poorer mental health and that mental health and well-being was worst for mothers of children living in persistent poverty , " she said .

at a meeting on monday night , canterbury city councillors voted unanimously in favour of the new 1,200-seat marlowe theatre .
the refurbishment includes a new , three-tier auditorium that will provide a better view and acoustics , allowing for bigger shows to be staged .
there will also be a second , smaller , more flexible performance space to provide education and training .
the scheduled opening for the revamped marlowe theatre , which is housed in a 1920s cinema building in canterbury , is december 2010 .
it is hoped the new marlowe theatre will become a centre of excellence for performing arts within the region .
last month it was announced that prince edward had become its royal patron .
the earl of wessex will be fully involved in the project until the venue opens , the council said .

members of the bristol no borders group chained themselves to a car parked across the entrance to the centre .
they said the aim was to prevent agency staff leaving in vehicles to carry out " inhumane " dawn raids to remove families living in the uk unlawfully .
an agency spokeswoman said officers were trained to treat families as sensitively as possible .
" we only seek to remove families who are in the uk unlawfully when all appeal rights are exhausted and they have no further claim to remain in the uk , " she said .
" throughout the removal process , we take the welfare of children extremely seriously .
" officers involved in family removals receive thorough training in procedures to minimise the distress caused to a removable family .
" all officers involved are trained to treat all members of the family as sensitively as possible . "
but jo freeman from the no borders group said : " doors are kicked in and families are snatched from their beds and taken to detention centres , where they are punished for seeking refuge in this country , and taken away from their houses , jobs , schools and communities . "

members of the bristol no borders group chained themselves to a car parked across the entrance to the centre .
they said the aim was to prevent agency staff leaving in vehicles to carry out " inhumane " dawn raids to remove families living in the uk unlawfully .
an agency spokeswoman said officers were trained to treat families as sensitively as possible .
" we only seek to remove families who are in the uk unlawfully when all appeal rights are exhausted and they have no further claim to remain in the uk , " she said .
" throughout the removal process , we take the welfare of children extremely seriously .
" officers involved in family removals receive thorough training in procedures to minimise the distress caused to a removable family .
" all officers involved are trained to treat all members of the family as sensitively as possible . "

the payout will be made in instalments over three years and will add 10 % to policy values , parent firm aviva said .
the deal follows earlier disputes on how the money , part of a £ 5.5bn " surplus " in aviva 's investment funds , should be divided .
negotiations are continuing on how the rest of the money should be split .
mark hodges , chief executive of norwich union life , said : " this special bonus is a major boost to policy values . "
windfall the company announced that with-profits policyholders in its cgnu life and culac with-profits funds - typically people holding endowment policies , pension policies and with-profits bonds - would be in line for the bonus .
those funds underlie the policies sold by the former commercial union and general accident insurance companies , both of which have subsequently become part of aviva .
the payout will come in three annual instalments from this year , paid in the form of bonuses added to the value of policies .
under the bonus scheme , a policyholder with a typical with-profit bond - based on a £ 30,000 investment in 2001 - would have £ 4,500 added to their policy over three years .
a 25-year endowment policy taken out in 1985 with a £ 50 monthly premium should get a bonus of £ 3,735 over three years , the company said .
those who are eligible will receive letters in the next few weeks giving detailed information .
clare spottiswoode represents more than a million aviva policyholders policyholder advocate claire spottiswoode , an independent expert appointed to represent policyholder interests , said she was pleased that policyholders would get the bulk of the initial surplus payout .
" i am disappointed , however , that the payment is to be made over a three-year period .
the surplus funds are available now yet policyholders whose policies mature before the end of the three years will not be paid the full amount , " she said .
negotiations continue negotiations are continuing on how the remainder of the £ 5.5bn surplus should be divided up .
aviva has made an offer to ms spottiswoode and has asked for a response by the end of february .
consumer group which ? said the company should no longer hold on to the surplus .
" while this may seem like a generous gesture by norwich union , the fact remains that this is n't even half of the inherited estate , " said the consumer group 's personal finance campaigner dominic lindley .
the " inherited estate " is the term used to describe the surplus assets in a with-profits fund which have built up over many years .
which ? said some of the return from the investments in the fund is kept back in good years and added back to top-up returns during periods of poor performance .
inherited estates largely build up because companies hold back too much money .
an aviva spokesman explained that a similar number of policy holders in with-profits funds under the norwich union name would not be offered any bonus as their inherited estate had already been distributed to them .
that took place at the time of the company 's conversion from a mutually owned society when it floated on the stock market flotation in 1997 .

the payout will be made in instalments over three years and will add 10 % to policy values , parent firm aviva said .
the deal follows earlier disputes on how the money , part of a £ 5.5bn " surplus " in aviva 's investment funds , should be divided .
negotiations are continuing on how the rest of the money should be split .
mark hodges , chief executive of norwich union life , said : " this special bonus is a major boost to policy values . "
windfall the company announced that with-profits policyholders in its cgnu life and culac with-profits funds - typically people holding endowment policies , pension policies and with-profits bonds - would be in line for the bonus .
those funds underlie the policies sold by the former commercial union and general accident insurance companies , both of which have subsequently become part of aviva .
the payout will come in three annual instalments from this year , paid in the form of bonuses added to the value of policies .
under the bonus scheme , a policyholder with a typical with-profit bond - based on a £ 30,000 investment in 2001 - would have £ 4,500 added to their policy over three years .
a 25-year endowment policy taken out in 1985 with a £ 50 monthly premium should get a bonus of £ 3,735 over three years , the company said .
those who are eligible will receive letters in the next few weeks giving detailed information .
policyholder advocate claire spottiswoode , an independent expert appointed to represent policyholder interests , said she was pleased that policyholders would get the bulk of the initial surplus payout .
" i am disappointed , however , that the payment is to be made over a three-year period .
the surplus funds are available now yet policyholders whose policies mature before the end of the three years will not be paid the full amount , " she said .
negotiations continue negotiations are continuing on how the remainder of the £ 5.5bn surplus should be divided up .
aviva has made an offer to ms spottiswoode and has asked for a response by the end of february .
consumer group which ? said the company should no longer hold on to the surplus .
" while this may seem like a generous gesture by norwich union , the fact remains that this is n't even half of the inherited estate , " said the consumer group 's personal finance campaigner dominic lindley .
the " inherited estate " is the term used to describe the surplus assets in a with-profits fund which have built up over many years .
which ? said some of the return from the investments in the fund is kept back in good years and added back to top-up returns during periods of poor performance .
inherited estates largely build up because companies hold back too much money .
an aviva spokesman explained that a similar number of policy holders in with-profits funds under the norwich union name would not be offered any bonus as their inherited estate had already been distributed to them .
that took place at the time of the company 's conversion from a mutually owned society when it floated on the stock market flotation in 1997 .

the meeting came after ministers said they were " minded " to turn down the application from lewis wind power .
it wants to site 181 massive wind turbines on barvas moor .
almost 10,000 objections went to ministers , many from local people , but the scheme has been backed by the local council .
last month , ministers indicated that they were minded to turn down the development because of european nature designations .
lewis wind power , which is a joint venture between international engineering project company amec and british energy , has been given 21 days to change ministers ' minds .
bird life the company wants to find out if there is any more that can be done to argue the case before friday 's deadline .
supporters of the turbines have pointed to potential economic benefits , claiming more than 400 jobs would be created during construction , most of them at a fabrication yard at arnish on lewis .
however , rspb scotland has warned that the development threatens the habitats of rare wild birds .
the islands council 's convener and vice convener have accused the environmental agencies who opposed the plan of " the most miserable form of environmental colonialism , sitting in the central belt lecturing the natives " .
but bodies like the rspb say bird life must be protected and many insist their way of life would be damaged by a development on this scale .
the isles ' local authority , comhairle nan eilean siar , has taken its campaign backing the wind farm on barvas moor to the european union .
comhairle leaders also met enterprise minister jim mather , calling on the first minister to step into the row .
it wants alex salmond to intervene because it believes the project will bring jobs and other economic and social benefits .
the scottish government described the discussions as " useful and wide-ranging " .
the final decision on the planning application rests with the scottish government .
