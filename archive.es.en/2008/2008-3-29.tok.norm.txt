the organizer told dw-world.de how the game works and why he wants it to take off it germany . the tournament on march 29-30 in berlin and stuttgart marks the start of the first season for germany 's brand new blind soccer league .
manuel neukirchner is the director of the sepp herberger foundation , a co-sponsor of the project .
the foundation was originally created in 1976 to advance the social and socio-political role of soccer in germany . dw-world.de : the german blind soccer leagues opens its first season with a tournament .
tell us a bit about it . manuel neukirchner : blind soccer is completely new in germany .
it 's more or less a pilot project . but blind soccer is an established sport in 21 countries and our goal , together with our partners , is to establish the sport here in germany .
an organized tournament is very important for this , and we 've planned one on march 29 and 30 in stuttgart and berlin with eight teams .
we hope that this will help launch this very exciting sport . does blind soccer have the same rules as soccer for seeing players ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger was the national coach from 1938-1942 and again from 1950-1964 of course blind soccer differs from soccer for seeing people .
the teams are smaller - there are four players on the field and one goalie .
much of the game functions via acoustic signals .
the ball is designed with rattles inside of it .
the players kick by ear , you could say . guides stand along the outer boundaries ; these are people that guide the blind and visually impaired players and warn them if a collision is about to occur .
they control the game from the outside .
the goalies also help guide their fellow players on the field . -lsb- editor 's note : the four field players are generally fully blind , while the goalie is visually impaired . -rsb- your foundation is a co-sponsor of the tournament .
what does it hope to achieve ? the sepp herberger foundation , which was founded 30 years ago , is the oldest soccer foundation in germany .
former national trainer sepp herberger initiated it together with the german soccer association . sepp herberger 's wish was always to use the integrative power of soccer for the good of the society .
and that 's what we want to achieve with this project as well - to better integrate blind and visually impaired people into society . soccer is an element that joins people together , especially for people with impairments and handicaps . hicham driouich interviewed manuel neukirchn -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the troops were there to protect the civilians . now the swedish military is saying that french soldiers tortured congolese civilians during the operation .
the german government , which did n't send troops on the mission but provided logistical assistance , could n't confirm the accusations . " the foreign ministry is not aware of the report , " a ministry spokeswoman told dw-world.de.
" we will examine the issue . " swedish soldiers witnessed torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have said the eu should have joined forces with the un according to an internet notice posted by the swedish military , a claim was filed in late may 2007 .
results from an ensuing investigation indicate that it is highly probable that the torture allegations are valid . in the notice , a lawyer representing the swedish military said that " torture-like methods " had been implemented during the artemis mission .
the other eu countries that participated in the operation have been informed of the scandal , claimed the military . france led the artemis operation in 2003 and sent the largest contingent of soldiers .
other european countries , including sweden , also sent troops . according to the swedish television news magazine uppdrag granskning , swedish soldiers observed their french compatriots as they tortured a congolese man in civilian clothes for hours , allegedly beating and strangling him .
according to the report , the episode did n't end until the swedish soldiers went to the french commander . doubt cast on the necessity of mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sent troops to dr congo in 2006 operation artemis is considered today to mark the beginning of europe 's security policy , which makes the accusations all the more explosive .
it was the first mission that the eu carried out without relying on resources from nato . the german military , the bundeswehr , sent supplies via transall cargo aircraft stationed in neighboring uganda and provided an airbus for medical purposes .
in addition , two german soldiers were sent to work at the artemis headquarters in france . the operation lasted just a few months and officially ended on sept .
1 , 2003 .
tens of thousands of refugees returned to the city of bunia and the eu troops succeeded in disarming the militias , the german government reported . critics of the operation have said that the eu could have backed up the un peacekeeping force in dr congo instead of sending their own troops . " it was a field test for joint military operations , " said german eu parliamentarian frithjof schmidt from the greens .
he added that he thought france just wanted to have its own troops on the scene , independent of the un . dirk eckert -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbian fm wants eu membership , but only with kosovo serbia is committed to joining the eu , but also adamant about not recognizing kosovo 's independence , said the balkan country 's foreign minister on saturday after an informal meeting with his eu counterparts . " despite all the challenges and despite all the difficulties that we are going through , we remain committed to the path of european integration , " vuk jeremic told journalists on saturday , march 29 , after meeting with eu 's foreign ministers over breakfast in brdo , slovenia .
" it was a very friendly , constructive discussion , " dimitrij rupel , foreign minister of eu president slovenia , told reporters afterwards .

" despite all the challenges and despite all the difficulties that we are going through , we remain committed to the path of european integration , " vuk jeremic told journalists on saturday , march 29 , after meeting with eu 's foreign ministers over breakfast in brdo , slovenia .
" it was a very friendly , constructive discussion , " dimitrij rupel , foreign minister of eu president slovenia , told reporters afterwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was complaining on both sides , slovenia 's foreign minister said " mr. jeremic of course complained a little bit , the europeans complained a little bit , but in the end i think we said whatever we wanted to say , " rupel said .
the serbian foreign minister gave no sign of giving ground on the most divisive issue in the relationship between serbia and the eu - the support of almost all eu member states for the independence of kosovo - which serbia insists is an indivisible part of its territory .
" we continue fighting for what we believe is rightfully ours , " jeremic said .
" serbia is not going to use force , but serbia will not go away , diplomatically and politically , in the fight to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
jeremic , an ally of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , left for belgrade before european foreign ministers met with other western balkans leaders , including kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
a slovenian presidency official said the kosovo delegation was officially attending under the aegis of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and its german head , joachim ruecker .
a major diplomatic breach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci -lrb- right -rrb- shook hands with croatia 's foreign minister gordan jandrokovic following the row over kosovo 's independence bid , serbia withdrew its ambassadors from the eu states which recognized kosovo , a move which has not yet been repealed .
jeremic indicated that that line was not likely to soften until at least after a un general assembly meeting in september .
" we 're going to work hard to make it obvious that a majority of un members are for our point of view , " he said , adding that eu nations ' recognition of kosovo played into the hands of nationalists running in serbia 's may 11 parliamentary elections .
while the majority of eu countries recognized kosovo , the issue of its unilateral declaration of independence remains divisive within the 27-member block with romania , spain , greece and cyprus so far refraining from recognizing the province 's secession .
portuguese president anibal cavaco silva on saturday said kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence was " abnormal " and called on his country 's government to consider any recognition carefully .
" the unilateral declaration of independence is something very abnormal and there are no provisions for it in international law , " he told antena 1 radio station .

" with all the attention on serbia and kosovo , bosnia must not become a secondary issue , " miroslav lajcak said .
bosnia is not yet a candidate for eu membership but has been offered a pre-candidacy stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , which offers substantial trade and economic support in return for legal and economic reforms in line with eu rules .
the eu initialled the saa in december 2007 , but has refused to sign it until a key reform of the police service is implemented .
bosnia 's parliament is to vote on the reform on wednesday .
eu attempts to stabilize the western balkans by broadly backing kosovo 's independence while offering serbia an saa had caused deep concern in the bosniak -lrb- muslim -rrb- community , lajcak said .
this is because serbia has not yet managed to arrest bosnian serb wartime leaders ratko mladic and radovan karadzic , who have been indicted on war crimes charges by international prosecutors in the hague .

the troops were there to protect the civilians . now the swedish military is saying that french soldiers tortured congolese civilians during the operation .
the german government , which did n't send troops on the mission but provided logistical assistance , could n't confirm the accusations . " the foreign ministry is not aware of the report , " a ministry spokeswoman told dw-world.de.
" we will examine the issue . " swedish soldiers witnessed torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have said the eu should have joined forces with the un according to an internet notice posted by the swedish military , a claim was filed in late may 2007 .
results from an ensuing investigation indicate that it is highly probable that the torture allegations are valid . in the notice , a lawyer representing the swedish military said that " torture-like methods " had been implemented during the artemis mission .
the other eu countries that participated in the operation have been informed of the scandal , claimed the military . france led the artemis operation in 2003 and sent the largest contingent of soldiers .
other european countries , including sweden , also sent troops . according to the swedish television news magazine uppdrag granskning , swedish soldiers observed their french compatriots as they tortured a congolese man in civilian clothes for hours , allegedly beating and strangling him .
according to the report , the episode did n't end until the swedish soldiers went to the french commander . doubt cast on the necessity of mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sent troops to dr congo in 2006 operation artemis is considered today to mark the beginning of europe 's security policy , which makes the accusations all the more explosive .
it was the first mission that the eu carried out without relying on resources from nato . the german military , the bundeswehr , sent supplies via transall cargo aircraft stationed in neighboring uganda and provided an airbus for medical purposes .
in addition , two german soldiers were sent to work at the artemis headquarters in france . the operation lasted just a few months and officially ended on sept .
1 , 2003 .
tens of thousands of refugees returned to the city of bunia and the eu troops succeeded in disarming the militias , the german government reported . critics of the operation have said that the eu could have backed up the un peacekeeping force in dr congo instead of sending their own troops . " it was a field test for joint military operations , " said german eu parliamentarian frithjof schmidt from the greens .
he added that he thought france just wanted to have its own troops on the scene , independent of the un . dirk eckert -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organizer told dw-world.de how the game works and why he wants it to take off it germany . the tournament on march 29-30 in berlin and stuttgart marks the start of the first season for germany 's brand new blind soccer league .
manuel neukirchner is the director of the sepp herberger foundation , a co-sponsor of the project .
the foundation was originally created in 1976 to advance the social and socio-political role of soccer in germany . dw-world.de : the german blind soccer leagues opens its first season with a tournament .
tell us a bit about it . manuel neukirchner : blind soccer is completely new in germany .
it 's more or less a pilot project . but blind soccer is an established sport in 21 countries and our goal , together with our partners , is to establish the sport here in germany .
an organized tournament is very important for this , and we 've planned one on march 29 and 30 in stuttgart and berlin with eight teams .
we hope that this will help launch this very exciting sport . does blind soccer have the same rules as soccer for seeing players ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger was the national coach from 1938-1942 and again from 1950-1964 of course blind soccer differs from soccer for seeing people .
the teams are smaller - there are four players on the field and one goalie .
much of the game functions via acoustic signals .
the ball is designed with rattles inside of it .
the players kick by ear , you could say . guides stand along the outer boundaries ; these are people that guide the blind and visually impaired players and warn them if a collision is about to occur .
they control the game from the outside .
the goalies also help guide their fellow players on the field . -lsb- editor 's note : the four field players are generally fully blind , while the goalie is visually impaired . -rsb- your foundation is a co-sponsor of the tournament .
what does it hope to achieve ? the sepp herberger foundation , which was founded 30 years ago , is the oldest soccer foundation in germany .
former national trainer sepp herberger initiated it together with the german soccer association . sepp herberger 's wish was always to use the integrative power of soccer for the good of the society .
and that 's what we want to achieve with this project as well - to better integrate blind and visually impaired people into society . soccer is an element that joins people together , especially for people with impairments and handicaps . hicham driouich interviewed manuel neukirchn -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 29.03.2008 serbia remains steady in opposition to kosovo independence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which path will serbia take ?
serbian fm wants eu membership , but only with kosovo serbia is committed to joining the eu , but also adamant about not recognizing kosovo 's independence , said the balkan country 's foreign minister on saturday after an informal meeting with his eu counterparts . " despite all the challenges and despite all the difficulties that we are going through , we remain committed to the path of european integration , " vuk jeremic told journalists on saturday , march 29 , after meeting with eu 's foreign ministers over breakfast in brdo , slovenia .
" it was a very friendly , constructive discussion , " dimitrij rupel , foreign minister of eu president slovenia , told reporters afterwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was complaining on both sides , slovenia 's foreign minister said " mr. jeremic of course complained a little bit , the europeans complained a little bit , but in the end i think we said whatever we wanted to say , " rupel said .
the serbian foreign minister gave no sign of giving ground on the most divisive issue in the relationship between serbia and the eu - the support of almost all eu member states for the independence of kosovo - which serbia insists is an indivisible part of its territory .
" we continue fighting for what we believe is rightfully ours , " jeremic said .
" serbia is not going to use force , but serbia will not go away , diplomatically and politically , in the fight to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
jeremic , an ally of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , left for belgrade before european foreign ministers met with other western balkans leaders , including kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
a slovenian presidency official said the kosovo delegation was officially attending under the aegis of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and its german head , joachim ruecker .
a major diplomatic breach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci -lrb- right -rrb- shook hands with croatia 's foreign minister gordan jandrokovic following the row over kosovo 's independence bid , serbia withdrew its ambassadors from the eu states which recognized kosovo , a move which has not yet been repealed .
jeremic indicated that that line was not likely to soften until at least after a un general assembly meeting in september .
" we 're going to work hard to make it obvious that a majority of un members are for our point of view , " he said , adding that eu nations ' recognition of kosovo played into the hands of nationalists running in serbia 's may 11 parliamentary elections .
while the majority of eu countries recognized kosovo , the issue of its unilateral declaration of independence remains divisive within the 27-member block with romania , spain , greece and cyprus so far refraining from recognizing the province 's secession .
portuguese president anibal cavaco silva on saturday said kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence was " abnormal " and called on his country 's government to consider any recognition carefully .
" the unilateral declaration of independence is something very abnormal and there are no provisions for it in international law , " he told antena 1 radio station .
do n't forget bosnia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu took over the peacekeeping duties in bosnia from the un in 2003 meanwhile , the eu 's envy to bosnia-herzegovina said that the 27-member bloc risked losing sight of what was happening in the rest of the volatile region by focusing solely on events in serbia and kosovo .
" with all the attention on serbia and kosovo , bosnia must not become a secondary issue , " miroslav lajcak said .
bosnia is not yet a candidate for eu membership but has been offered a pre-candidacy stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , which offers substantial trade and economic support in return for legal and economic reforms in line with eu rules .
the eu initialled the saa in december 2007 , but has refused to sign it until a key reform of the police service is implemented .
bosnia 's parliament is to vote on the reform on wednesday .
eu attempts to stabilize the western balkans by broadly backing kosovo 's independence while offering serbia an saa had caused deep concern in the bosniak -lrb- muslim -rrb- community , lajcak said .
this is because serbia has not yet managed to arrest bosnian serb wartime leaders ratko mladic and radovan karadzic , who have been indicted on war crimes charges by international prosecutors in the hague .
" as long as they 're at large , the war is not over and bosniaks ca n't see our moves as fair and just , " lajcak warned . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbian fm wants eu membership , but only with kosovo serbia is committed to joining the eu , but also adamant about not recognizing kosovo 's independence , said the balkan country 's foreign minister on saturday after an informal meeting with his eu counterparts . " despite all the challenges and despite all the difficulties that we are going through , we remain committed to the path of european integration , " vuk jeremic told journalists on saturday , march 29 , after meeting with eu 's foreign ministers over breakfast in brdo , slovenia .
" it was a very friendly , constructive discussion , " dimitrij rupel , foreign minister of eu president slovenia , told reporters afterwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was complaining on both sides , slovenia 's foreign minister said " mr. jeremic of course complained a little bit , the europeans complained a little bit , but in the end i think we said whatever we wanted to say , " rupel said .
the serbian foreign minister gave no sign of giving ground on the most divisive issue in the relationship between serbia and the eu - the support of almost all eu member states for the independence of kosovo - which serbia insists is an indivisible part of its territory .
" we continue fighting for what we believe is rightfully ours , " jeremic said .
" serbia is not going to use force , but serbia will not go away , diplomatically and politically , in the fight to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
jeremic , an ally of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , left for belgrade before european foreign ministers met with other western balkans leaders , including kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
a slovenian presidency official said the kosovo delegation was officially attending under the aegis of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and its german head , joachim ruecker .
a major diplomatic breach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci -lrb- right -rrb- shook hands with croatia 's foreign minister gordan jandrokovic following the row over kosovo 's independence bid , serbia withdrew its ambassadors from the eu states which recognized kosovo , a move which has not yet been repealed .
jeremic indicated that that line was not likely to soften until at least after a un general assembly meeting in september .
" we 're going to work hard to make it obvious that a majority of un members are for our point of view , " he said , adding that eu nations ' recognition of kosovo played into the hands of nationalists running in serbia 's may 11 parliamentary elections .
while the majority of eu countries recognized kosovo , the issue of its unilateral declaration of independence remains divisive within the 27-member block with romania , spain , greece and cyprus so far refraining from recognizing the province 's secession .
portuguese president anibal cavaco silva on saturday said kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence was " abnormal " and called on his country 's government to consider any recognition carefully .
" the unilateral declaration of independence is something very abnormal and there are no provisions for it in international law , " he told antena 1 radio station .
do n't forget bosnia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu took over the peacekeeping duties in bosnia from the un in 2003 meanwhile , the eu 's envy to bosnia-herzegovina said that the 27-member bloc risked losing sight of what was happening in the rest of the volatile region by focusing solely on events in serbia and kosovo .
" with all the attention on serbia and kosovo , bosnia must not become a secondary issue , " miroslav lajcak said .
bosnia is not yet a candidate for eu membership but has been offered a pre-candidacy stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , which offers substantial trade and economic support in return for legal and economic reforms in line with eu rules .
the eu initialled the saa in december 2007 , but has refused to sign it until a key reform of the police service is implemented .
bosnia 's parliament is to vote on the reform on wednesday .
eu attempts to stabilize the western balkans by broadly backing kosovo 's independence while offering serbia an saa had caused deep concern in the bosniak -lrb- muslim -rrb- community , lajcak said .
this is because serbia has not yet managed to arrest bosnian serb wartime leaders ratko mladic and radovan karadzic , who have been indicted on war crimes charges by international prosecutors in the hague .
" as long as they 're at large , the war is not over and bosniaks ca n't see our moves as fair and just , " lajcak warned . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbian fm wants eu membership , but only with kosovo serbia is committed to joining the eu , but also adamant about not recognizing kosovo 's independence , said the balkan country 's foreign minister on saturday after an informal meeting with his eu counterparts . " despite all the challenges and despite all the difficulties that we are going through , we remain committed to the path of european integration , " vuk jeremic told journalists on saturday , march 29 , after meeting with eu 's foreign ministers over breakfast in brdo , slovenia .
" it was a very friendly , constructive discussion , " dimitrij rupel , foreign minister of eu president slovenia , told reporters afterwards .

the serbian foreign minister gave no sign of giving ground on the most divisive issue in the relationship between serbia and the eu - the support of almost all eu member states for the independence of kosovo - which serbia insists is an indivisible part of its territory .
" we continue fighting for what we believe is rightfully ours , " jeremic said .
" serbia is not going to use force , but serbia will not go away , diplomatically and politically , in the fight to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity . "

jeremic indicated that that line was not likely to soften until at least after a un general assembly meeting in september .

portuguese president anibal cavaco silva on saturday said kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence was " abnormal " and called on his country 's government to consider any recognition carefully .

and the eu is the world 's foremost producer , consumer , exporter and importer of the drink .
but a new environmemental study leaves a decidedly nasty taste . the pesticide action network pan europe tested 40 different red wines - from countries that included germany , france and italy - and found that 35 of them contained traces of pesticide .
price is no guarantee of purity , the pan study indicated .
pesticides were found in two bottles of french wine that cost more than 200 euros -lrb- $ 315 -rrb- .
the findings also showed that the conventionally produced wines were considerably more contaminated than their organic counterparts .
five of the six organic wines contained no pesticides , while all 34 from normal production were tainted to some extent .
the french organic wine appeared to have been affected by pesticides sprayed in neighboring fields .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winegrowers appear to use a disproportionate amount of pesticides among wines tested from france , italy , chile and south africa , four included substances that are categorized in the european union as causing cancer or birth defects , according to the study unveiled in brussels .
ten of the german wines analyzed and the austrian wines contained chemicals that are categorized as " possibly carcinogenic " in the united states .
this category does not exist in the eu .
none of the wines tested , however , exceeded maximum limits for these substances .
varied reaction to study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do you know what you 're drinking ?
the study drew mixed reactions from members of the european parliament .
green mep hiltrud beyer described the results as " alarming and shocking " and called for legislation banning the use of dangerous pesticides .
by contrast , christian democrat mep christa klass warned against panic-mongering .
" according to existing law , the wines are completely harmless , " she said , adding that if there were any health risks that the eu should consider tightening up licensing procedures .
pan spokesman elliott cannell said the group was not calling on anyone to stop drinking wine .
but he said winegrowers should restrict their use of pesticides .
according to the network , winegrowing accounts for some 20 percent of all pesticides used in the eu , while only 3 percent of the bloc 's arable land is given over to growing vines . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

results from an ensuing investigation indicate that it is highly probable that the torture allegations are valid . in the notice , a lawyer representing the swedish military said that " torture-like methods " had been implemented during the artemis mission .
the other eu countries that participated in the operation have been informed of the scandal , claimed the military . france led the artemis operation in 2003 and sent the largest contingent of soldiers .
other european countries , including sweden , also sent troops . according to the swedish television news magazine uppdrag granskning , swedish soldiers observed their french compatriots as they tortured a congolese man in civilian clothes for hours , allegedly beating and strangling him .

it was the first mission that the eu carried out without relying on resources from nato . the german military , the bundeswehr , sent supplies via transall cargo aircraft stationed in neighboring uganda and provided an airbus for medical purposes .
in addition , two german soldiers were sent to work at the artemis headquarters in france . the operation lasted just a few months and officially ended on sept .
1 , 2003 .
tens of thousands of refugees returned to the city of bunia and the eu troops succeeded in disarming the militias , the german government reported . critics of the operation have said that the eu could have backed up the un peacekeeping force in dr congo instead of sending their own troops . " it was a field test for joint military operations , " said german eu parliamentarian frithjof schmidt from the greens .
he added that he thought france just wanted to have its own troops on the scene , independent of the un . dirk eckert -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbian fm wants eu membership , but only with kosovo serbia is committed to joining the eu , but also adamant about not recognizing kosovo 's independence , said the balkan country 's foreign minister on saturday after an informal meeting with his eu counterparts . " despite all the challenges and despite all the difficulties that we are going through , we remain committed to the path of european integration , " vuk jeremic told journalists on saturday , march 29 , after meeting with eu 's foreign ministers over breakfast in brdo , slovenia .
" it was a very friendly , constructive discussion , " dimitrij rupel , foreign minister of eu president slovenia , told reporters afterwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was complaining on both sides , slovenia 's foreign minister said " mr. jeremic of course complained a little bit , the europeans complained a little bit , but in the end i think we said whatever we wanted to say , " rupel said .
the serbian foreign minister gave no sign of giving ground on the most divisive issue in the relationship between serbia and the eu - the support of almost all eu member states for the independence of kosovo - which serbia insists is an indivisible part of its territory .
" we continue fighting for what we believe is rightfully ours , " jeremic said .
" serbia is not going to use force , but serbia will not go away , diplomatically and politically , in the fight to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
jeremic , an ally of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , left for belgrade before european foreign ministers met with other western balkans leaders , including kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
a slovenian presidency official said the kosovo delegation was officially attending under the aegis of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and its german head , joachim ruecker .
a major diplomatic breach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci -lrb- right -rrb- shook hands with croatia 's foreign minister gordan jandrokovic following the row over kosovo 's independence bid , serbia withdrew its ambassadors from the eu states which recognized kosovo , a move which has not yet been repealed .
jeremic indicated that that line was not likely to soften until at least after a un general assembly meeting in september .
" we 're going to work hard to make it obvious that a majority of un members are for our point of view , " he said , adding that eu nations ' recognition of kosovo played into the hands of nationalists running in serbia 's may 11 parliamentary elections .
while the majority of eu countries recognized kosovo , the issue of its unilateral declaration of independence remains divisive within the 27-member block with romania , spain , greece and cyprus so far refraining from recognizing the province 's secession .
portuguese president anibal cavaco silva on saturday said kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence was " abnormal " and called on his country 's government to consider any recognition carefully .
" the unilateral declaration of independence is something very abnormal and there are no provisions for it in international law , " he told antena 1 radio station .

" with all the attention on serbia and kosovo , bosnia must not become a secondary issue , " miroslav lajcak said .
bosnia is not yet a candidate for eu membership but has been offered a pre-candidacy stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , which offers substantial trade and economic support in return for legal and economic reforms in line with eu rules .
the eu initialled the saa in december 2007 , but has refused to sign it until a key reform of the police service is implemented .

eu attempts to stabilize the western balkans by broadly backing kosovo 's independence while offering serbia an saa had caused deep concern in the bosniak -lrb- muslim -rrb- community , lajcak said .
this is because serbia has not yet managed to arrest bosnian serb wartime leaders ratko mladic and radovan karadzic , who have been indicted on war crimes charges by international prosecutors in the hague .

serbian fm wants eu membership , but only with kosovo serbia is committed to joining the eu , but also adamant about not recognizing kosovo 's independence , said the balkan country 's foreign minister on saturday after an informal meeting with his eu counterparts . " despite all the challenges and despite all the difficulties that we are going through , we remain committed to the path of european integration , " vuk jeremic told journalists on saturday , march 29 , after meeting with eu 's foreign ministers over breakfast in brdo , slovenia .
" it was a very friendly , constructive discussion , " dimitrij rupel , foreign minister of eu president slovenia , told reporters afterwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was complaining on both sides , slovenia 's foreign minister said " mr. jeremic of course complained a little bit , the europeans complained a little bit , but in the end i think we said whatever we wanted to say , " rupel said .
the serbian foreign minister gave no sign of giving ground on the most divisive issue in the relationship between serbia and the eu - the support of almost all eu member states for the independence of kosovo - which serbia insists is an indivisible part of its territory .
" we continue fighting for what we believe is rightfully ours , " jeremic said .
" serbia is not going to use force , but serbia will not go away , diplomatically and politically , in the fight to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
jeremic , an ally of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , left for belgrade before european foreign ministers met with other western balkans leaders , including kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
a slovenian presidency official said the kosovo delegation was officially attending under the aegis of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and its german head , joachim ruecker .
a major diplomatic breach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci -lrb- right -rrb- shook hands with croatia 's foreign minister gordan jandrokovic following the row over kosovo 's independence bid , serbia withdrew its ambassadors from the eu states which recognized kosovo , a move which has not yet been repealed .
jeremic indicated that that line was not likely to soften until at least after a un general assembly meeting in september .
" we 're going to work hard to make it obvious that a majority of un members are for our point of view , " he said , adding that eu nations ' recognition of kosovo played into the hands of nationalists running in serbia 's may 11 parliamentary elections .
while the majority of eu countries recognized kosovo , the issue of its unilateral declaration of independence remains divisive within the 27-member block with romania , spain , greece and cyprus so far refraining from recognizing the province 's secession .
portuguese president anibal cavaco silva on saturday said kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence was " abnormal " and called on his country 's government to consider any recognition carefully .
" the unilateral declaration of independence is something very abnormal and there are no provisions for it in international law , " he told antena 1 radio station .

" with all the attention on serbia and kosovo , bosnia must not become a secondary issue , " miroslav lajcak said .
bosnia is not yet a candidate for eu membership but has been offered a pre-candidacy stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , which offers substantial trade and economic support in return for legal and economic reforms in line with eu rules .
the eu initialled the saa in december 2007 , but has refused to sign it until a key reform of the police service is implemented .

eu attempts to stabilize the western balkans by broadly backing kosovo 's independence while offering serbia an saa had caused deep concern in the bosniak -lrb- muslim -rrb- community , lajcak said .
this is because serbia has not yet managed to arrest bosnian serb wartime leaders ratko mladic and radovan karadzic , who have been indicted on war crimes charges by international prosecutors in the hague .

serbian fm wants eu membership , but only with kosovo serbia is committed to joining the eu , but also adamant about not recognizing kosovo 's independence , said the balkan country 's foreign minister on saturday after an informal meeting with his eu counterparts . " despite all the challenges and despite all the difficulties that we are going through , we remain committed to the path of european integration , " vuk jeremic told journalists on saturday , march 29 , after meeting with eu 's foreign ministers over breakfast in brdo , slovenia .
" it was a very friendly , constructive discussion , " dimitrij rupel , foreign minister of eu president slovenia , told reporters afterwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was complaining on both sides , slovenia 's foreign minister said " mr. jeremic of course complained a little bit , the europeans complained a little bit , but in the end i think we said whatever we wanted to say , " rupel said .
the serbian foreign minister gave no sign of giving ground on the most divisive issue in the relationship between serbia and the eu - the support of almost all eu member states for the independence of kosovo - which serbia insists is an indivisible part of its territory .
" we continue fighting for what we believe is rightfully ours , " jeremic said .
" serbia is not going to use force , but serbia will not go away , diplomatically and politically , in the fight to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
jeremic , an ally of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , left for belgrade before european foreign ministers met with other western balkans leaders , including kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
a slovenian presidency official said the kosovo delegation was officially attending under the aegis of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and its german head , joachim ruecker .
a major diplomatic breach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci -lrb- right -rrb- shook hands with croatia 's foreign minister gordan jandrokovic following the row over kosovo 's independence bid , serbia withdrew its ambassadors from the eu states which recognized kosovo , a move which has not yet been repealed .
jeremic indicated that that line was not likely to soften until at least after a un general assembly meeting in september .
" we 're going to work hard to make it obvious that a majority of un members are for our point of view , " he said , adding that eu nations ' recognition of kosovo played into the hands of nationalists running in serbia 's may 11 parliamentary elections .
while the majority of eu countries recognized kosovo , the issue of its unilateral declaration of independence remains divisive within the 27-member block with romania , spain , greece and cyprus so far refraining from recognizing the province 's secession .
portuguese president anibal cavaco silva on saturday said kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence was " abnormal " and called on his country 's government to consider any recognition carefully .
" the unilateral declaration of independence is something very abnormal and there are no provisions for it in international law , " he told antena 1 radio station .
do n't forget bosnia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu took over the peacekeeping duties in bosnia from the un in 2003 meanwhile , the eu 's envy to bosnia-herzegovina said that the 27-member bloc risked losing sight of what was happening in the rest of the volatile region by focusing solely on events in serbia and kosovo .
" with all the attention on serbia and kosovo , bosnia must not become a secondary issue , " miroslav lajcak said .
bosnia is not yet a candidate for eu membership but has been offered a pre-candidacy stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , which offers substantial trade and economic support in return for legal and economic reforms in line with eu rules .
the eu initialled the saa in december 2007 , but has refused to sign it until a key reform of the police service is implemented .
bosnia 's parliament is to vote on the reform on wednesday .
eu attempts to stabilize the western balkans by broadly backing kosovo 's independence while offering serbia an saa had caused deep concern in the bosniak -lrb- muslim -rrb- community , lajcak said .
this is because serbia has not yet managed to arrest bosnian serb wartime leaders ratko mladic and radovan karadzic , who have been indicted on war crimes charges by international prosecutors in the hague .
" as long as they 're at large , the war is not over and bosniaks ca n't see our moves as fair and just , " lajcak warned . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 29.03.2008 serbia remains steady in opposition to kosovo independence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which path will serbia take ?
serbian fm wants eu membership , but only with kosovo serbia is committed to joining the eu , but also adamant about not recognizing kosovo 's independence , said the balkan country 's foreign minister on saturday after an informal meeting with his eu counterparts . " despite all the challenges and despite all the difficulties that we are going through , we remain committed to the path of european integration , " vuk jeremic told journalists on saturday , march 29 , after meeting with eu 's foreign ministers over breakfast in brdo , slovenia .
" it was a very friendly , constructive discussion , " dimitrij rupel , foreign minister of eu president slovenia , told reporters afterwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was complaining on both sides , slovenia 's foreign minister said " mr. jeremic of course complained a little bit , the europeans complained a little bit , but in the end i think we said whatever we wanted to say , " rupel said .
the serbian foreign minister gave no sign of giving ground on the most divisive issue in the relationship between serbia and the eu - the support of almost all eu member states for the independence of kosovo - which serbia insists is an indivisible part of its territory .
" we continue fighting for what we believe is rightfully ours , " jeremic said .
" serbia is not going to use force , but serbia will not go away , diplomatically and politically , in the fight to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
jeremic , an ally of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , left for belgrade before european foreign ministers met with other western balkans leaders , including kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
a slovenian presidency official said the kosovo delegation was officially attending under the aegis of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and its german head , joachim ruecker .
a major diplomatic breach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci -lrb- right -rrb- shook hands with croatia 's foreign minister gordan jandrokovic following the row over kosovo 's independence bid , serbia withdrew its ambassadors from the eu states which recognized kosovo , a move which has not yet been repealed .
jeremic indicated that that line was not likely to soften until at least after a un general assembly meeting in september .
" we 're going to work hard to make it obvious that a majority of un members are for our point of view , " he said , adding that eu nations ' recognition of kosovo played into the hands of nationalists running in serbia 's may 11 parliamentary elections .
while the majority of eu countries recognized kosovo , the issue of its unilateral declaration of independence remains divisive within the 27-member block with romania , spain , greece and cyprus so far refraining from recognizing the province 's secession .
portuguese president anibal cavaco silva on saturday said kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence was " abnormal " and called on his country 's government to consider any recognition carefully .
" the unilateral declaration of independence is something very abnormal and there are no provisions for it in international law , " he told antena 1 radio station .
do n't forget bosnia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu took over the peacekeeping duties in bosnia from the un in 2003 meanwhile , the eu 's envy to bosnia-herzegovina said that the 27-member bloc risked losing sight of what was happening in the rest of the volatile region by focusing solely on events in serbia and kosovo .
" with all the attention on serbia and kosovo , bosnia must not become a secondary issue , " miroslav lajcak said .
bosnia is not yet a candidate for eu membership but has been offered a pre-candidacy stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , which offers substantial trade and economic support in return for legal and economic reforms in line with eu rules .
the eu initialled the saa in december 2007 , but has refused to sign it until a key reform of the police service is implemented .
bosnia 's parliament is to vote on the reform on wednesday .
eu attempts to stabilize the western balkans by broadly backing kosovo 's independence while offering serbia an saa had caused deep concern in the bosniak -lrb- muslim -rrb- community , lajcak said .
this is because serbia has not yet managed to arrest bosnian serb wartime leaders ratko mladic and radovan karadzic , who have been indicted on war crimes charges by international prosecutors in the hague .
" as long as they 're at large , the war is not over and bosniaks ca n't see our moves as fair and just , " lajcak warned . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbian fm wants eu membership , but only with kosovo serbia is committed to joining the eu , but also adamant about not recognizing kosovo 's independence , said the balkan country 's foreign minister on saturday after an informal meeting with his eu counterparts . " despite all the challenges and despite all the difficulties that we are going through , we remain committed to the path of european integration , " vuk jeremic told journalists on saturday , march 29 , after meeting with eu 's foreign ministers over breakfast in brdo , slovenia .
" it was a very friendly , constructive discussion , " dimitrij rupel , foreign minister of eu president slovenia , told reporters afterwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was complaining on both sides , slovenia 's foreign minister said " mr. jeremic of course complained a little bit , the europeans complained a little bit , but in the end i think we said whatever we wanted to say , " rupel said .
the serbian foreign minister gave no sign of giving ground on the most divisive issue in the relationship between serbia and the eu - the support of almost all eu member states for the independence of kosovo - which serbia insists is an indivisible part of its territory .
" we continue fighting for what we believe is rightfully ours , " jeremic said .
" serbia is not going to use force , but serbia will not go away , diplomatically and politically , in the fight to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
jeremic , an ally of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , left for belgrade before european foreign ministers met with other western balkans leaders , including kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
a slovenian presidency official said the kosovo delegation was officially attending under the aegis of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and its german head , joachim ruecker .
a major diplomatic breach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci -lrb- right -rrb- shook hands with croatia 's foreign minister gordan jandrokovic following the row over kosovo 's independence bid , serbia withdrew its ambassadors from the eu states which recognized kosovo , a move which has not yet been repealed .
jeremic indicated that that line was not likely to soften until at least after a un general assembly meeting in september .
" we 're going to work hard to make it obvious that a majority of un members are for our point of view , " he said , adding that eu nations ' recognition of kosovo played into the hands of nationalists running in serbia 's may 11 parliamentary elections .
while the majority of eu countries recognized kosovo , the issue of its unilateral declaration of independence remains divisive within the 27-member block with romania , spain , greece and cyprus so far refraining from recognizing the province 's secession .
portuguese president anibal cavaco silva on saturday said kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence was " abnormal " and called on his country 's government to consider any recognition carefully .
" the unilateral declaration of independence is something very abnormal and there are no provisions for it in international law , " he told antena 1 radio station .

" with all the attention on serbia and kosovo , bosnia must not become a secondary issue , " miroslav lajcak said .
bosnia is not yet a candidate for eu membership but has been offered a pre-candidacy stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , which offers substantial trade and economic support in return for legal and economic reforms in line with eu rules .
the eu initialled the saa in december 2007 , but has refused to sign it until a key reform of the police service is implemented .

eu attempts to stabilize the western balkans by broadly backing kosovo 's independence while offering serbia an saa had caused deep concern in the bosniak -lrb- muslim -rrb- community , lajcak said .
this is because serbia has not yet managed to arrest bosnian serb wartime leaders ratko mladic and radovan karadzic , who have been indicted on war crimes charges by international prosecutors in the hague .

the troops were there to protect the civilians . now the swedish military is saying that french soldiers tortured congolese civilians during the operation .
the german government , which did n't send troops on the mission but provided logistical assistance , could n't confirm the accusations . " the foreign ministry is not aware of the report , " a ministry spokeswoman told dw-world.de.
" we will examine the issue . " swedish soldiers witnessed torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have said the eu should have joined forces with the un according to an internet notice posted by the swedish military , a claim was filed in late may 2007 .
results from an ensuing investigation indicate that it is highly probable that the torture allegations are valid . in the notice , a lawyer representing the swedish military said that " torture-like methods " had been implemented during the artemis mission .
the other eu countries that participated in the operation have been informed of the scandal , claimed the military . france led the artemis operation in 2003 and sent the largest contingent of soldiers .
other european countries , including sweden , also sent troops . according to the swedish television news magazine uppdrag granskning , swedish soldiers observed their french compatriots as they tortured a congolese man in civilian clothes for hours , allegedly beating and strangling him .
according to the report , the episode did n't end until the swedish soldiers went to the french commander . doubt cast on the necessity of mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sent troops to dr congo in 2006 operation artemis is considered today to mark the beginning of europe 's security policy , which makes the accusations all the more explosive .
it was the first mission that the eu carried out without relying on resources from nato . the german military , the bundeswehr , sent supplies via transall cargo aircraft stationed in neighboring uganda and provided an airbus for medical purposes .
in addition , two german soldiers were sent to work at the artemis headquarters in france . the operation lasted just a few months and officially ended on sept .
1 , 2003 .
tens of thousands of refugees returned to the city of bunia and the eu troops succeeded in disarming the militias , the german government reported . critics of the operation have said that the eu could have backed up the un peacekeeping force in dr congo instead of sending their own troops . " it was a field test for joint military operations , " said german eu parliamentarian frithjof schmidt from the greens .
he added that he thought france just wanted to have its own troops on the scene , independent of the un . dirk eckert -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 29.03.2008 serbia remains steady in opposition to kosovo independence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which path will serbia take ?
serbian fm wants eu membership , but only with kosovo serbia is committed to joining the eu , but also adamant about not recognizing kosovo 's independence , said the balkan country 's foreign minister on saturday after an informal meeting with his eu counterparts . " despite all the challenges and despite all the difficulties that we are going through , we remain committed to the path of european integration , " vuk jeremic told journalists on saturday , march 29 , after meeting with eu 's foreign ministers over breakfast in brdo , slovenia .
" it was a very friendly , constructive discussion , " dimitrij rupel , foreign minister of eu president slovenia , told reporters afterwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was complaining on both sides , slovenia 's foreign minister said " mr. jeremic of course complained a little bit , the europeans complained a little bit , but in the end i think we said whatever we wanted to say , " rupel said .
the serbian foreign minister gave no sign of giving ground on the most divisive issue in the relationship between serbia and the eu - the support of almost all eu member states for the independence of kosovo - which serbia insists is an indivisible part of its territory .
" we continue fighting for what we believe is rightfully ours , " jeremic said .
" serbia is not going to use force , but serbia will not go away , diplomatically and politically , in the fight to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
jeremic , an ally of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , left for belgrade before european foreign ministers met with other western balkans leaders , including kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
a slovenian presidency official said the kosovo delegation was officially attending under the aegis of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and its german head , joachim ruecker .
a major diplomatic breach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci -lrb- right -rrb- shook hands with croatia 's foreign minister gordan jandrokovic following the row over kosovo 's independence bid , serbia withdrew its ambassadors from the eu states which recognized kosovo , a move which has not yet been repealed .
jeremic indicated that that line was not likely to soften until at least after a un general assembly meeting in september .
" we 're going to work hard to make it obvious that a majority of un members are for our point of view , " he said , adding that eu nations ' recognition of kosovo played into the hands of nationalists running in serbia 's may 11 parliamentary elections .
while the majority of eu countries recognized kosovo , the issue of its unilateral declaration of independence remains divisive within the 27-member block with romania , spain , greece and cyprus so far refraining from recognizing the province 's secession .
portuguese president anibal cavaco silva on saturday said kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence was " abnormal " and called on his country 's government to consider any recognition carefully .
" the unilateral declaration of independence is something very abnormal and there are no provisions for it in international law , " he told antena 1 radio station .
do n't forget bosnia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu took over the peacekeeping duties in bosnia from the un in 2003 meanwhile , the eu 's envy to bosnia-herzegovina said that the 27-member bloc risked losing sight of what was happening in the rest of the volatile region by focusing solely on events in serbia and kosovo .
" with all the attention on serbia and kosovo , bosnia must not become a secondary issue , " miroslav lajcak said .
bosnia is not yet a candidate for eu membership but has been offered a pre-candidacy stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , which offers substantial trade and economic support in return for legal and economic reforms in line with eu rules .
the eu initialled the saa in december 2007 , but has refused to sign it until a key reform of the police service is implemented .
bosnia 's parliament is to vote on the reform on wednesday .
eu attempts to stabilize the western balkans by broadly backing kosovo 's independence while offering serbia an saa had caused deep concern in the bosniak -lrb- muslim -rrb- community , lajcak said .
this is because serbia has not yet managed to arrest bosnian serb wartime leaders ratko mladic and radovan karadzic , who have been indicted on war crimes charges by international prosecutors in the hague .
" as long as they 're at large , the war is not over and bosniaks ca n't see our moves as fair and just , " lajcak warned . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the troops were there to protect the civilians . now the swedish military is saying that french soldiers tortured congolese civilians during the operation .
the german government , which did n't send troops on the mission but provided logistical assistance , could n't confirm the accusations . " the foreign ministry is not aware of the report , " a ministry spokeswoman told dw-world.de.
" we will examine the issue . " swedish soldiers witnessed torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have said the eu should have joined forces with the un according to an internet notice posted by the swedish military , a claim was filed in late may 2007 .
results from an ensuing investigation indicate that it is highly probable that the torture allegations are valid . in the notice , a lawyer representing the swedish military said that " torture-like methods " had been implemented during the artemis mission .
the other eu countries that participated in the operation have been informed of the scandal , claimed the military . france led the artemis operation in 2003 and sent the largest contingent of soldiers .
other european countries , including sweden , also sent troops . according to the swedish television news magazine uppdrag granskning , swedish soldiers observed their french compatriots as they tortured a congolese man in civilian clothes for hours , allegedly beating and strangling him .
according to the report , the episode did n't end until the swedish soldiers went to the french commander . doubt cast on the necessity of mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sent troops to dr congo in 2006 operation artemis is considered today to mark the beginning of europe 's security policy , which makes the accusations all the more explosive .
it was the first mission that the eu carried out without relying on resources from nato . the german military , the bundeswehr , sent supplies via transall cargo aircraft stationed in neighboring uganda and provided an airbus for medical purposes .
in addition , two german soldiers were sent to work at the artemis headquarters in france . the operation lasted just a few months and officially ended on sept .
1 , 2003 .
tens of thousands of refugees returned to the city of bunia and the eu troops succeeded in disarming the militias , the german government reported . critics of the operation have said that the eu could have backed up the un peacekeeping force in dr congo instead of sending their own troops . " it was a field test for joint military operations , " said german eu parliamentarian frithjof schmidt from the greens .
he added that he thought france just wanted to have its own troops on the scene , independent of the un . dirk eckert -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbian fm wants eu membership , but only with kosovo serbia is committed to joining the eu , but also adamant about not recognizing kosovo 's independence , said the balkan country 's foreign minister on saturday after an informal meeting with his eu counterparts . " despite all the challenges and despite all the difficulties that we are going through , we remain committed to the path of european integration , " vuk jeremic told journalists on saturday , march 29 , after meeting with eu 's foreign ministers over breakfast in brdo , slovenia .
" it was a very friendly , constructive discussion , " dimitrij rupel , foreign minister of eu president slovenia , told reporters afterwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was complaining on both sides , slovenia 's foreign minister said " mr. jeremic of course complained a little bit , the europeans complained a little bit , but in the end i think we said whatever we wanted to say , " rupel said .
the serbian foreign minister gave no sign of giving ground on the most divisive issue in the relationship between serbia and the eu - the support of almost all eu member states for the independence of kosovo - which serbia insists is an indivisible part of its territory .
" we continue fighting for what we believe is rightfully ours , " jeremic said .
" serbia is not going to use force , but serbia will not go away , diplomatically and politically , in the fight to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
jeremic , an ally of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , left for belgrade before european foreign ministers met with other western balkans leaders , including kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
a slovenian presidency official said the kosovo delegation was officially attending under the aegis of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and its german head , joachim ruecker .
a major diplomatic breach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci -lrb- right -rrb- shook hands with croatia 's foreign minister gordan jandrokovic following the row over kosovo 's independence bid , serbia withdrew its ambassadors from the eu states which recognized kosovo , a move which has not yet been repealed .
jeremic indicated that that line was not likely to soften until at least after a un general assembly meeting in september .
" we 're going to work hard to make it obvious that a majority of un members are for our point of view , " he said , adding that eu nations ' recognition of kosovo played into the hands of nationalists running in serbia 's may 11 parliamentary elections .
while the majority of eu countries recognized kosovo , the issue of its unilateral declaration of independence remains divisive within the 27-member block with romania , spain , greece and cyprus so far refraining from recognizing the province 's secession .
portuguese president anibal cavaco silva on saturday said kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence was " abnormal " and called on his country 's government to consider any recognition carefully .
" the unilateral declaration of independence is something very abnormal and there are no provisions for it in international law , " he told antena 1 radio station .
do n't forget bosnia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu took over the peacekeeping duties in bosnia from the un in 2003 meanwhile , the eu 's envy to bosnia-herzegovina said that the 27-member bloc risked losing sight of what was happening in the rest of the volatile region by focusing solely on events in serbia and kosovo .
" with all the attention on serbia and kosovo , bosnia must not become a secondary issue , " miroslav lajcak said .
bosnia is not yet a candidate for eu membership but has been offered a pre-candidacy stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , which offers substantial trade and economic support in return for legal and economic reforms in line with eu rules .
the eu initialled the saa in december 2007 , but has refused to sign it until a key reform of the police service is implemented .
bosnia 's parliament is to vote on the reform on wednesday .
eu attempts to stabilize the western balkans by broadly backing kosovo 's independence while offering serbia an saa had caused deep concern in the bosniak -lrb- muslim -rrb- community , lajcak said .
this is because serbia has not yet managed to arrest bosnian serb wartime leaders ratko mladic and radovan karadzic , who have been indicted on war crimes charges by international prosecutors in the hague .

serbian fm wants eu membership , but only with kosovo serbia is committed to joining the eu , but also adamant about not recognizing kosovo 's independence , said the balkan country 's foreign minister on saturday after an informal meeting with his eu counterparts . " despite all the challenges and despite all the difficulties that we are going through , we remain committed to the path of european integration , " vuk jeremic told journalists on saturday , march 29 , after meeting with eu 's foreign ministers over breakfast in brdo , slovenia .
" it was a very friendly , constructive discussion , " dimitrij rupel , foreign minister of eu president slovenia , told reporters afterwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was complaining on both sides , slovenia 's foreign minister said " mr. jeremic of course complained a little bit , the europeans complained a little bit , but in the end i think we said whatever we wanted to say , " rupel said .
the serbian foreign minister gave no sign of giving ground on the most divisive issue in the relationship between serbia and the eu - the support of almost all eu member states for the independence of kosovo - which serbia insists is an indivisible part of its territory .
" we continue fighting for what we believe is rightfully ours , " jeremic said .
" serbia is not going to use force , but serbia will not go away , diplomatically and politically , in the fight to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
jeremic , an ally of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , left for belgrade before european foreign ministers met with other western balkans leaders , including kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
a slovenian presidency official said the kosovo delegation was officially attending under the aegis of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and its german head , joachim ruecker .
a major diplomatic breach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci -lrb- right -rrb- shook hands with croatia 's foreign minister gordan jandrokovic following the row over kosovo 's independence bid , serbia withdrew its ambassadors from the eu states which recognized kosovo , a move which has not yet been repealed .
jeremic indicated that that line was not likely to soften until at least after a un general assembly meeting in september .
" we 're going to work hard to make it obvious that a majority of un members are for our point of view , " he said , adding that eu nations ' recognition of kosovo played into the hands of nationalists running in serbia 's may 11 parliamentary elections .
while the majority of eu countries recognized kosovo , the issue of its unilateral declaration of independence remains divisive within the 27-member block with romania , spain , greece and cyprus so far refraining from recognizing the province 's secession .
portuguese president anibal cavaco silva on saturday said kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence was " abnormal " and called on his country 's government to consider any recognition carefully .
" the unilateral declaration of independence is something very abnormal and there are no provisions for it in international law , " he told antena 1 radio station .
do n't forget bosnia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu took over the peacekeeping duties in bosnia from the un in 2003 meanwhile , the eu 's envy to bosnia-herzegovina said that the 27-member bloc risked losing sight of what was happening in the rest of the volatile region by focusing solely on events in serbia and kosovo .
" with all the attention on serbia and kosovo , bosnia must not become a secondary issue , " miroslav lajcak said .
bosnia is not yet a candidate for eu membership but has been offered a pre-candidacy stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , which offers substantial trade and economic support in return for legal and economic reforms in line with eu rules .
the eu initialled the saa in december 2007 , but has refused to sign it until a key reform of the police service is implemented .
bosnia 's parliament is to vote on the reform on wednesday .
eu attempts to stabilize the western balkans by broadly backing kosovo 's independence while offering serbia an saa had caused deep concern in the bosniak -lrb- muslim -rrb- community , lajcak said .
this is because serbia has not yet managed to arrest bosnian serb wartime leaders ratko mladic and radovan karadzic , who have been indicted on war crimes charges by international prosecutors in the hague .
" as long as they 're at large , the war is not over and bosniaks ca n't see our moves as fair and just , " lajcak warned . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbian fm wants eu membership , but only with kosovo serbia is committed to joining the eu , but also adamant about not recognizing kosovo 's independence , said the balkan country 's foreign minister on saturday after an informal meeting with his eu counterparts . " despite all the challenges and despite all the difficulties that we are going through , we remain committed to the path of european integration , " vuk jeremic told journalists on saturday , march 29 , after meeting with eu 's foreign ministers over breakfast in brdo , slovenia .
" it was a very friendly , constructive discussion , " dimitrij rupel , foreign minister of eu president slovenia , told reporters afterwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was complaining on both sides , slovenia 's foreign minister said " mr. jeremic of course complained a little bit , the europeans complained a little bit , but in the end i think we said whatever we wanted to say , " rupel said .
the serbian foreign minister gave no sign of giving ground on the most divisive issue in the relationship between serbia and the eu - the support of almost all eu member states for the independence of kosovo - which serbia insists is an indivisible part of its territory .
" we continue fighting for what we believe is rightfully ours , " jeremic said .
" serbia is not going to use force , but serbia will not go away , diplomatically and politically , in the fight to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
jeremic , an ally of serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic , left for belgrade before european foreign ministers met with other western balkans leaders , including kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
a slovenian presidency official said the kosovo delegation was officially attending under the aegis of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and its german head , joachim ruecker .
a major diplomatic breach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci -lrb- right -rrb- shook hands with croatia 's foreign minister gordan jandrokovic following the row over kosovo 's independence bid , serbia withdrew its ambassadors from the eu states which recognized kosovo , a move which has not yet been repealed .
jeremic indicated that that line was not likely to soften until at least after a un general assembly meeting in september .
" we 're going to work hard to make it obvious that a majority of un members are for our point of view , " he said , adding that eu nations ' recognition of kosovo played into the hands of nationalists running in serbia 's may 11 parliamentary elections .
while the majority of eu countries recognized kosovo , the issue of its unilateral declaration of independence remains divisive within the 27-member block with romania , spain , greece and cyprus so far refraining from recognizing the province 's secession .
portuguese president anibal cavaco silva on saturday said kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence was " abnormal " and called on his country 's government to consider any recognition carefully .
" the unilateral declaration of independence is something very abnormal and there are no provisions for it in international law , " he told antena 1 radio station .
do n't forget bosnia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu took over the peacekeeping duties in bosnia from the un in 2003 meanwhile , the eu 's envy to bosnia-herzegovina said that the 27-member bloc risked losing sight of what was happening in the rest of the volatile region by focusing solely on events in serbia and kosovo .
" with all the attention on serbia and kosovo , bosnia must not become a secondary issue , " miroslav lajcak said .
bosnia is not yet a candidate for eu membership but has been offered a pre-candidacy stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , which offers substantial trade and economic support in return for legal and economic reforms in line with eu rules .
the eu initialled the saa in december 2007 , but has refused to sign it until a key reform of the police service is implemented .
bosnia 's parliament is to vote on the reform on wednesday .
eu attempts to stabilize the western balkans by broadly backing kosovo 's independence while offering serbia an saa had caused deep concern in the bosniak -lrb- muslim -rrb- community , lajcak said .
this is because serbia has not yet managed to arrest bosnian serb wartime leaders ratko mladic and radovan karadzic , who have been indicted on war crimes charges by international prosecutors in the hague .
" as long as they 're at large , the war is not over and bosniaks ca n't see our moves as fair and just , " lajcak warned . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the uk and the us are among the 15 nations invited on the one-day trip to tibet 's capital lhasa - the first since anti-china riots began two weeks ago .
the us welcomed the move , but said diplomats and observers should be allowed to see areas surrounding lhasa .
the visit follows a short trip to the city by a group of foreign journalists .
meanwhile , european union foreign ministers meeting in slovenia have rejected a proposed boycott of the opening ceremony of the olympic games in beijing .
european leaders have been among the most vocal in criticising china 's reaction to the protests in tibetan communities .
tibet 's government-in-exile , based in india , says about 140 people were killed in a crackdown by chinese security forces .
beijing disputes this , saying 19 people were killed by rioters .
tightly controlled a group of 17 diplomats from countries including japan and australia arrived in tibet from beijing on saturday .
they are expected to return to the chinese capital later on saturday .
us state department spokesman sean mccormack said the trip was a " step in the right direction " .
" but it 's not a substitute for the ability of our diplomats , as well as others , to travel not only to lhasa , but into the surrounding area specifically , " he said .
the visit follows a short trip by a group of journalists from chinese and international media .
a 30-strong group of monks in lhasa staged a noisy protest as the reporters were shown around one of tibet 's holiest sites , the jokhang temple , on thursday .
the monks shouted " tibet is not free , tibet is not free " .

at least 54 people have died across rio state since the start of the year while the number of people infected is now said to have passed 43,000 .
the judge accused the authorities of neglect and indifference to sufferers of the mosquito-borne fever .
they had failed to act to prevent and contain the epidemic , she said .
for weeks , hospitals in rio have been struggling to cope with the latest outbreak of dengue , a disease which is spread by one type of mosquito and which in extreme cases can be fatal .
agony on friday at just one hospital in the city people said they had been waiting around five hours to receive attention , and a long queue stretched out of the emergency room into the street outside .
a short time afterwards , a woman waiting in the hot sun for attention fainted and had to be carried away .
judge patricia cogliatti de carvalho has now ruled that the state and city have to send patients with dengue to private hospitals and clinics when demand exceeds the capacity of public hospitals .
the state would then have to pay for the treatment within 20 days .
in her ruling , the judge spoke of the " neglect and indifference " shown by the authorities in relation to dengue .
this had meant patients , including old people and children , passing through indescribable agony and embarrassment as they waited hours for treatment , as well as running the risk of losing their lives .

at least 54 people have died across rio state since the start of the year while the number of people infected is now said to have passed 43,000 .
the judge accused the authorities of neglect and indifference to sufferers of the mosquito-borne fever .
they had failed to act to prevent and contain the epidemic , she said .
for weeks , hospitals in rio have been struggling to cope with the latest outbreak of dengue , a disease which is spread by one type of mosquito and which in extreme cases can be fatal .

judge patricia cogliatti de carvalho has now ruled that the state and city have to send patients with dengue to private hospitals and clinics when demand exceeds the capacity of public hospitals .
the state would then have to pay for the treatment within 20 days .
in her ruling , the judge spoke of the " neglect and indifference " shown by the authorities in relation to dengue .
this had meant patients , including old people and children , passing through indescribable agony and embarrassment as they waited hours for treatment , as well as running the risk of losing their lives .

they were rescued in a joint operation by emergency services and moor rescuers , and treated for hypothermia .
helicopter searches the girls were camping in the yelverton area at sheepstor when they got lost and became hypothermic .
