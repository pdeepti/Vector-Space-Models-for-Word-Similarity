through the abandonment of the negotiations over a partnership and cooperation settlement between the eu and russia , a unanimous europe has made it clear that it does not seek partnership with russia at any price .
that is how the eu has succeeded in making russia give in without having to use rhetoric to heat up the dispute .
the europeans ' calm , mediating politics has thus brought them a small symbolic win .
moscow 's clever chess tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel russia 's acceptance was , however , a clever chess tactic by president medvedev , since , in withdrawing its troops from the buffer zones , russia actually does not lose much ground .
the withdrawal plays no part regarding military strategy : russian army units continue to secure the renegade regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
neither has russia lost out from a diplomatic or political perspective : russia continues to disregard the principle of georgia 's territorial integrity by its recognition of abkhazian and south ossetian independence .
russia 's agreement to europe 's demand of withdrawing troops from the buffer zone should therefore not be seen as a political turning point in the caucasus conflict .
it is much more a symbolic gesture to europe .
russia has also made the decision not to heat up the dispute with europe further - but no more than that .
on the same day as the withdrawal agreement , there were further signs that the conflict is simply moving into a second stage as georgia accused russia of ethnic cleansing at the international court in the hague .
conflict continues sarkozy 's visit is a long way from reaching a solution to the caucasus conflict .
the fundamental problem remains : russia has used georgian aggression against the separatist regime in south ossetia to recognize the independence of the pro-russian regions .
in doing so , moscow has violated the principle of the invulnerability of post-soviet territory borders - also legally - for the first time since the fall of the soviet union 17 years ago .
that does not just mean a dangerous situation for georgia , but a threatening development for peace on the eurasian continent .
that is why a caucasus stability pact is necessary - a pact which russia and the eu are hopefully drawing closer to with the arrangement to send over 200 eu observers to oversee the ceasefire .

the device is to be manufactured in germany . the as-yet-unnamed device is the size of a piece of standard printer paper and the screen allows users to annotate documents and will offer the option of embedding video .
the new invention was shown off at an industry event called demofall in san diego .
it is due to go on sale early next year and is expected to be embraced by newspaper publishers eager to cut the costs associated with printing and distributing paper editions .
the device uses technology from e-ink , the company that also powers electronic readers from sony and amazon .
but the screen of the plastic logic gadget is built with transistor arrays on flexible plastic surfaces that are lighter , stronger , less expensive and more environmentally friendly than the silicon-based systems in use until now .
the plastic reader is designed to store dozens or hundreds of business documents on a very thin digital reader .
it can store e-books , magazines , newspapers , pdf files and all kinds of information , the company said .
" even though we have positioned this for business documents , newspapers -lrb- are -rrb- what everyone asks for , " said richard archuleta , plastic logic 's ceo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 09.09.2008 germany boosts afghan aid budget as violence rises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the international security assistance force in afghanistan germany 's cabinet has approved a funding increase to help rebuild afghanistan .
but with violent attacks also on the rise , some question whether the country is ready for reconstruction - or still in a state of war . the plans would increase german aid to afghanistan from 140 million to 170 euros -lrb- $ 198-240 million -rrb- .
the funding boost comes amid a surge of violence in the relatively quiet northern regions of afghanistan .
the german government hopes more aid money will make those areas more secure .
" we have to give the -lsb- reconstruction -rsb- process in afghanistan a recognizable face , " german defense minister franz josef jung said at an international security conference in berlin on tuesday , sept 8 .
" we wo n't be able to win this process militarily , " jung added .
moving targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quick reaction force patrols have been subject to increasing attacks near daily attacks in afghanistan underscore how precarious the situation there is .
on tuesday , three us soldiers were killed in the eastern part of the country , bringing the total number of foreign troop casualties in 2008 to 201 .
and the german defense ministry said one of its bases in the northern afghan city of kunduz had come under rocket attack on sunday .
that followed two other militant attacks on saturday - a suicide bombing and a roadside bomb aimed at a convoy of bundeswehr vehicles near mazar-i-sharif .
no soldiers or bystanders were injured in those incidents .
vocabulary of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defence minister jung says his troops are not at war defence minister jung has acknowledged that there have been “ significantly more attacks ” against german soldiers in recent weeks .
but he has insisted that troops serving in afghanistan are not caught up in a “ war . "
the german armed forces federation disagrees with that assessment .
following the death of a young german paratrooper at the end of august and the first civilian casualties at the hands of german soldiers a few days later , the federation 's chairman colonel bernhard gertz told reporters that the mission in afghanistan was nothing other than a " war against a fanatical enemy willing to do anything " .
in october , politicians in berlin are due to debate plans for a new parliamentary mandate that would increase the number of german troops in afghanistan from 3,500 to 4,500 .
" so many mistakes " as the world remembers the seventh anniversary of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks this week , escalating violence in afghanistan , which was invaded by a us-led coalition force two months after the attacks , has many worried .
the former eu envoy to afghanistan on tuesday slammed nato and us-led operations in the country , saying there is no coherent strategy and progress is unlikely while george w. bush remains us president . in a bbc interview to be aired tuesday , francesc vendrell lamented that " so many mistakes " were made after the us-led invasion in 2001 and warned that mounting civilian casualties were undermining support for the coalition . vandrell said the west had no coherent strategy for victory in afghanistan , adding the bush adminstration did not want to make any changes because they want to present the country as a success story . " we will need to wait , not for very long , for a new administration to be established and at that point we need to reveal our strategy , not only a us strategy but the overall strategy , because clearly what we are doing so far is not going to lead to success , " vandrell said . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the device is to be manufactured in germany . the as-yet-unnamed device is the size of a piece of standard printer paper and the screen allows users to annotate documents and will offer the option of embedding video .
the new invention was shown off at an industry event called demofall in san diego .
it is due to go on sale early next year and is expected to be embraced by newspaper publishers eager to cut the costs associated with printing and distributing paper editions .
the device uses technology from e-ink , the company that also powers electronic readers from sony and amazon .
but the screen of the plastic logic gadget is built with transistor arrays on flexible plastic surfaces that are lighter , stronger , less expensive and more environmentally friendly than the silicon-based systems in use until now .
the plastic reader is designed to store dozens or hundreds of business documents on a very thin digital reader .
it can store e-books , magazines , newspapers , pdf files and all kinds of information , the company said .
" even though we have positioned this for business documents , newspapers -lrb- are -rrb- what everyone asks for , " said richard archuleta , plastic logic 's ceo .
the company is due to open the world 's first commercial-scale plastic electronics manufacturing facility in dresden on sep .

the week after the first break is traditionally when fans begin to get angry and coaches lose their jobs . the first few weeks of the season are like the initial ninety days of a new head of state 's term of office .
voters - or in the case of soccer , supporters - are willing to overlook fumbles and bumbles as part of the settling-in process .
but once the league emerges from its first break , club management and fans expect results .
and that puts serious pressure on the clubs who 've yet to chalk up a win .
hanover , in particular , will be feeling the heat .
touted by many observers in the pre-season as a possible top-five squad , they failed to score a goal in their first three matches and currently occupy the bottom spot in the table .
hanover coach dieter hecking has promised a turn-around this weekend against moenchengladbach .
but should he fail to get three points at home against a newly promoted opponent , his ears will be ringing with the one word all german coaches hate most - fehlstart .
more than just a bad beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus ' season has gotten off with a whimper fehlstart is , on the surface , just the german for bad beginning .
but in the culture of the bundesliga , it 's much more than that , something approaching an existential state of awfulness that can only be remedied with personnel changes .
and since the transfer window is closed , the only big move a club can make is firing the coach .
bojan prasnikar knows the score .
last september , he took over at energie cottbus after the small eastern german club had earned only two points from its first seven games .
now , he 's the one who 's having to answer endless fehlstart questions from baying-for-blood reporters , as cottbus has also failed to score and are tied at the bottom on one point .
but it 's unlikely prasnikar will be able to reverse energie 's fortunes straight away .
he 's going up this weekend against one of the bundesliga 's heavy hitters - and a team that 's fighting a fehlstart of its own .
quo vadis , werder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's schaaf wishes he could turn back time it 's no surprise to find the likes of bochum and bielefeld near the bottom and heading toward another season of merely battling for survival .
but werder bremen 's form has been shocking .
the side that usually plays the bundesliga 's most attractive football is off to its worst start in nine years , earning only a pair of draws and dropping five points to mediocre opposition .
having been at bremen 's helm for a decade , thomas schaaf is probably unfireable unless the bottom totally drops out .
but if they fail to hammer cottbus , expect changes to the squad - with ageing captain frank baumann looking to be a prime candidate for replacement .
werder are five points adrift of a spot in the champions league .
there 's plenty of time left to close that gap , but a disappointing result against massive underdogs cottbus would have fans and management asking some unpleasant existential questions about whether this squad is still truly among the bundesliga 's elite . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is this a case of a state guarding a company against free competition ? the eu is set to try to end a long-running dispute over whether a german law giving the state of lower saxony veto powers in vw 's affairs is in violation of the block competition rules .
the eu has been trying to get germany 's federal government to scrap or revise the so-called " vw law " - which privileges lower saxony despite that state possessing less than the 25 percent of shares normally required for a veto - since 2004 .
the european court of justice ruled the 48-year-old law invalid last october .
it was subsequently revised , but not enough to satisfy the bloc .
" the facts are clear - they 're not changing their positions , " said a spokesman for eu internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy in a statement .
eu legal action would begin " as soon as possible , " added the spokesman .
porsche to benefit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw is one of germany 's most recognizable brands officials for lower saxony in the city of hanover had no comment on the proposed legal action , other than to say that mccreedy 's position was known .
the vw law was enacted in 1960 to allow the state government to protect germany 's largest carmaker from foreign takeover .
but it has come under increasing criticism in recent years , especially from porsche .
despite being smaller than the vw , the profitable , luxury-oriented company would like to take over the giant carmaker .
" this is completely in line with our thinking , " said a spokesman for porsche , which holds over 30 percent of voting rights in vw .
" we are firmly convinced there 's no need for a vw law . "
germany 's economic minister michael glos has also said he believes that the vw law is unnecessary and that the blocking clause favoring lower saxony could be removed .
unions representing vw workers , however , have been vocal in their support for the law , saying it protected the interests of employees . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu has been trying to get germany 's federal government to scrap or revise the so-called " vw law " - which privileges lower saxony despite that state possessing less than the 25 percent of shares normally required for a veto - since 2004 .
the european court of justice ruled the 48-year-old law invalid last october .
it was subsequently revised , but not enough to satisfy the bloc .
" the facts are clear - they 're not changing their positions , " said a spokesman for eu internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy in a statement .

the vw law was enacted in 1960 to allow the state government to protect germany 's largest carmaker from foreign takeover .
but it has come under increasing criticism in recent years , especially from porsche .
despite being smaller than the vw , the profitable , luxury-oriented company would like to take over the giant carmaker .
" this is completely in line with our thinking , " said a spokesman for porsche , which holds over 30 percent of voting rights in vw .
" we are firmly convinced there 's no need for a vw law . "
germany 's economic minister michael glos has also said he believes that the vw law is unnecessary and that the blocking clause favoring lower saxony could be removed .

the device is to be manufactured in germany . the as-yet-unnamed device is the size of a piece of standard printer paper and the screen allows users to annotate documents and will offer the option of embedding video .
the new invention was shown off at an industry event called demofall in san diego .
it is due to go on sale early next year and is expected to be embraced by newspaper publishers eager to cut the costs associated with printing and distributing paper editions .
the device uses technology from e-ink , the company that also powers electronic readers from sony and amazon .
but the screen of the plastic logic gadget is built with transistor arrays on flexible plastic surfaces that are lighter , stronger , less expensive and more environmentally friendly than the silicon-based systems in use until now .
the plastic reader is designed to store dozens or hundreds of business documents on a very thin digital reader .
it can store e-books , magazines , newspapers , pdf files and all kinds of information , the company said .
" even though we have positioned this for business documents , newspapers -lrb- are -rrb- what everyone asks for , " said richard archuleta , plastic logic 's ceo .
the company is due to open the world 's first commercial-scale plastic electronics manufacturing facility in dresden on sep .

but critics are n't convinced . swedish energy utility vattenfall sees carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- as a revolutionary answer to global warming which is largely blamed on carbon dioxide released when fossil fuels burn .
" this technology will become more important than offshore wind farms , " said vattenfall boss lars josefsson .
" our project at schwarze pumpe puts us at the forefront of this technology in the world , " said tuomo hatakka , the chief executive of vattenfall europe , referring to the the 70-million euro plant in eastern germany .
vattenfall , one of europe 's largest energy companies , hopes the project will help provide energy security through plentiful coal supplies while avoiding the co2 emissions that are blamed for global warming .
vattenfall underscores " clean technology " aspect a finnish-born executive who heads the swedish group 's berlin-based subsidiary , hatakka told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the process was viable because companies will have to buy eu allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ccs test plant has drawn prominent visitors including chancellor merkel " in tandem with eu-wide trading in emission rights , ccs will be economic .
at 30 to 35 euros per emission certificate , the technology breaks even , " he said .
the 30-megawatt pilot plant at schwarze pumpe in the lausitz region of eastern germany is very small compared to conventional power stations .
but it 's the first coal-fired power plant in the world ready to capture and store its own carbon dioxide emissions - a so-called ccs plant .
carbon dioxide emitted when lignite coal burns will not be vented up a chimney but piped away , compressed to a liquid and pumped into deep , porous rock .
the concentrated carbon dioxide will then be injected " for permanent storage " in a gas field in northern germany .
vattenfall plans to build two " demonstration plants " 10 times that size in germany and denmark by 2015 at the latest .
hatakka said the company aimed to commission its first " large-scale ccs power station " in 2020 .
the outcome of this new plant will be heat , water vapor , nine tons of co2 per hour and a milestone in clean energy technology , according to markus füller , a spokesman for vattenfall .
“ this process is necessary if we ever hope to continue using soft , lignite coal , he says .
we need to get a handle on the co2 problem , and we think this technology is the way to do it , " füller said .
critics are n't convinced but environmentalists say the technology uses far more energy than existing power generation and warn that there are no secure long-term storage facilities for the gas .
german conservation group bund on monday denounced the project as simply a cover allowing vattenfall to expand its network of conventional coal-fired power stations in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say the focus should be on expanding cheaper renewable energy rather than on polluting coal thorben becker of bund said it was still uncertain if ccs worked on a large scale .
ccs power stations would obtain 10 per cent less power from the coal than conventional plants did , and it was not clear if there were enough suitable sites to dump the co2 .
" instead of concentrating on far cheaper renewable energy , vattenfall is locking itself in for decades to converting climate-damaging brown coal into electricity , " he said .

the deal with india is a key step in sealing the india-us atomic technology accord signed by us president george w. bush and indian premier manmohan singh in 2005 .
the us-india business council , one of the champions of the pact between new delhi and washington , said the nsg 's decision could unlock nuclear energy investment in india worth more than $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- .

a controversial decision the us had been hoping for a quick decision on the embargo , so that the current us congress could ratify the accord before elections in november .
us lawmakers are pushing for a vote by the end of september .
the decision to lift the embargo was controversial , in part because india - which was embargoed in the first place after it developed and tested nuclear weapons test in 1974 - has so far refused to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .

but the bloc did not mention concrete security guarantees or membership prospects . probably the most heartening words from the summit for ukrainian president viktor yushchenko came at the concluding press conference , when summit chairman and french president nicolas sarkozy said that , in the eyes of europe , ukrainian territorial integrity was " non-negotiable . "
the meeting between yushchenko and representatives form the eu 's 27 member states came in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict and amidst ukrainian worries about moscow 's motives .
in a joint statement , eu member states " recognized that ukraine , as a european country , shares a common history and common values with the countries of the eu . "
the " association agreement " that emerged form the summit offers kiev enhanced status in its dealings with the eu .
but it does not say anything about whether ukraine could possibly join the bloc some day .
indeed the agreement , as sarkozy stressed to the press , " neither opens nor closes any route . "
for his part , yushchenko told reporters he was convinced that his country and the eu would sign " a very symbolic document cementing relations . "
" the main thing is that today we qualified as a european country , " yushchenko added .
" this is the first step of this great road that all countries which then became eu members , walked on . "
european divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian-georgian conflict has everyone worried about eastern europe but if the post-summit tone was warm , the statements and the agreement emerging from the meeting reflected the fact that the eu is not at all of a single mind as to where it stands vis-à-vis ukraine and russia .
" there are differing positions within the european council , " sarkozy said .
" and we explained to president yushchenko that this was the maximum we could promise him . "
britain , poland and sweden have been pushing the bloc to deepen ties with kiev to offset pressure from moscow .
but member states like germany , italy and the benelux countries want the eu to be more cautious and take more account of russia 's interests in eastern europe .
there are even questions as to whether the people of ukraine , with its heavy russian-speaking population , would truly welcome a more hard-line course toward moscow . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the bloc did not mention concrete security guarantees or membership prospects . probably the most heartening words from the summit for ukrainian president viktor yushchenko came at the concluding press conference , when summit chairman and french president nicolas sarkozy said that , in the eyes of europe , ukrainian territorial integrity was " non-negotiable . "
the meeting between yushchenko and representatives form the eu 's 27 member states came in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict and amidst ukrainian worries about moscow 's motives .
in a joint statement , eu member states " recognized that ukraine , as a european country , shares a common history and common values with the countries of the eu . "
the " association agreement " that emerged form the summit offers kiev enhanced status in its dealings with the eu .
but it does not say anything about whether ukraine could possibly join the bloc some day .
indeed the agreement , as sarkozy stressed to the press , " neither opens nor closes any route . "
for his part , yushchenko told reporters he was convinced that his country and the eu would sign " a very symbolic document cementing relations . "
" the main thing is that today we qualified as a european country , " yushchenko added .
" this is the first step of this great road that all countries which then became eu members , walked on . "

" there are differing positions within the european council , " sarkozy said .
" and we explained to president yushchenko that this was the maximum we could promise him . "
britain , poland and sweden have been pushing the bloc to deepen ties with kiev to offset pressure from moscow .

a berlin newspaper quoted a spokesman for the federal office of information matthias gaertner at the weekend saying that the chrome browser " should not be used for general use . "
since then there have been reports that the federal office for information security has issued an official warning against using the new google browser .
but on monday sep .
8 gaertner told the ap news agency that his comments had been taken out of context .
security experts are concerned the chrome browser uses a number for each user that is set up during installation and then communicated to a central server every time the product is in use for the purpose of collecting usage statistics such as details of program crashes .
critics are concerned that the number could be used to identify users .
google rejects security concerns but kay oberbeck , speaking for google , told the dpa news agency : " there are no connections made between the installation number and the entries in the search box or address box . "
the system of attributing a number to each user is not particular to this new google product .
mozilla , the browser of the non-commercial firefox brand , also sends a user number the software company 's server .
another concern about the product is that it collects data from users for use in functions such as the " omnibox " which remembers the topics of previous searches and suggests possible search topics .
google confirms that it saves two percent of data , including users ip addresses .
" this data is necessary to generate the completed search suggestions , " oberbeck explained .
oberbeck also stressed that user information is gathered in a way that makes the users anonymous , and he said that the function can be turned off simply .
critics have also said that , in releasing a test version of the product , google has given users a false sense of security .
" google should have clearly told its users that this is a beta version meant for testing , " daniel bachfeld of the german " c 't " computer magazine told dpa news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 09.09.2008 teams try to avoid dreaded bad start when season resumes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker mikael forssell is not yet a hanover helper many players are still with their national sides , but some bundesliga clubs are worrying about the season restart .
the week after the first break is traditionally when fans begin to get angry and coaches lose their jobs . the first few weeks of the season are like the initial ninety days of a new head of state 's term of office .
voters - or in the case of soccer , supporters - are willing to overlook fumbles and bumbles as part of the settling-in process .
but once the league emerges from its first break , club management and fans expect results .
and that puts serious pressure on the clubs who 've yet to chalk up a win .
hanover , in particular , will be feeling the heat .
touted by many observers in the pre-season as a possible top-five squad , they failed to score a goal in their first three matches and currently occupy the bottom spot in the table .
hanover coach dieter hecking has promised a turn-around this weekend against moenchengladbach .
but should he fail to get three points at home against a newly promoted opponent , his ears will be ringing with the one word all german coaches hate most - fehlstart .
more than just a bad beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus ' season has gotten off with a whimper fehlstart is , on the surface , just the german for bad beginning .
but in the culture of the bundesliga , it 's much more than that , something approaching an existential state of awfulness that can only be remedied with personnel changes .
and since the transfer window is closed , the only big move a club can make is firing the coach .
bojan prasnikar knows the score .
last september , he took over at energie cottbus after the small eastern german club had earned only two points from its first seven games .
now , he 's the one who 's having to answer endless fehlstart questions from baying-for-blood reporters , as cottbus has also failed to score and are tied at the bottom on one point .
but it 's unlikely prasnikar will be able to reverse energie 's fortunes straight away .
he 's going up this weekend against one of the bundesliga 's heavy hitters - and a team that 's fighting a fehlstart of its own .
quo vadis , werder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's schaaf wishes he could turn back time it 's no surprise to find the likes of bochum and bielefeld near the bottom and heading toward another season of merely battling for survival .
but werder bremen 's form has been shocking .
the side that usually plays the bundesliga 's most attractive football is off to its worst start in nine years , earning only a pair of draws and dropping five points to mediocre opposition .
having been at bremen 's helm for a decade , thomas schaaf is probably unfireable unless the bottom totally drops out .

the week after the first break is traditionally when fans begin to get angry and coaches lose their jobs . the first few weeks of the season are like the initial ninety days of a new head of state 's term of office .
voters - or in the case of soccer , supporters - are willing to overlook fumbles and bumbles as part of the settling-in process .
but once the league emerges from its first break , club management and fans expect results .
and that puts serious pressure on the clubs who 've yet to chalk up a win .
hanover , in particular , will be feeling the heat .
touted by many observers in the pre-season as a possible top-five squad , they failed to score a goal in their first three matches and currently occupy the bottom spot in the table .
hanover coach dieter hecking has promised a turn-around this weekend against moenchengladbach .
but should he fail to get three points at home against a newly promoted opponent , his ears will be ringing with the one word all german coaches hate most - fehlstart .
more than just a bad beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus ' season has gotten off with a whimper fehlstart is , on the surface , just the german for bad beginning .
but in the culture of the bundesliga , it 's much more than that , something approaching an existential state of awfulness that can only be remedied with personnel changes .
and since the transfer window is closed , the only big move a club can make is firing the coach .
bojan prasnikar knows the score .
last september , he took over at energie cottbus after the small eastern german club had earned only two points from its first seven games .
now , he 's the one who 's having to answer endless fehlstart questions from baying-for-blood reporters , as cottbus has also failed to score and are tied at the bottom on one point .
but it 's unlikely prasnikar will be able to reverse energie 's fortunes straight away .
he 's going up this weekend against one of the bundesliga 's heavy hitters - and a team that 's fighting a fehlstart of its own .
quo vadis , werder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's schaaf wishes he could turn back time it 's no surprise to find the likes of bochum and bielefeld near the bottom and heading toward another season of merely battling for survival .
but werder bremen 's form has been shocking .
the side that usually plays the bundesliga 's most attractive football is off to its worst start in nine years , earning only a pair of draws and dropping five points to mediocre opposition .
having been at bremen 's helm for a decade , thomas schaaf is probably unfireable unless the bottom totally drops out .
but if they fail to hammer cottbus , expect changes to the squad - with ageing captain frank baumann looking to be a prime candidate for replacement .
werder are five points adrift of a spot in the champions league .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 09.09.2008 opinion : eu-russia diplomacy shows signs of a detente großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's agreement to withdraw troops from the buffer zones is a step in the right direction , but a solution to the caucasus conflict is still a long way off , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . the announcement of russian president medvedev to pull back russian troops from the georgian central zone is a small success for the european union and the french president nicholas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu council presidency .
through the abandonment of the negotiations over a partnership and cooperation settlement between the eu and russia , a unanimous europe has made it clear that it does not seek partnership with russia at any price .
that is how the eu has succeeded in making russia give in without having to use rhetoric to heat up the dispute .
the europeans ' calm , mediating politics has thus brought them a small symbolic win .
moscow 's clever chess tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel russia 's acceptance was , however , a clever chess tactic by president medvedev , since , in withdrawing its troops from the buffer zones , russia actually does not lose much ground .
the withdrawal plays no part regarding military strategy : russian army units continue to secure the renegade regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
neither has russia lost out from a diplomatic or political perspective : russia continues to disregard the principle of georgia 's territorial integrity by its recognition of abkhazian and south ossetian independence .
russia 's agreement to europe 's demand of withdrawing troops from the buffer zone should therefore not be seen as a political turning point in the caucasus conflict .
it is much more a symbolic gesture to europe .
russia has also made the decision not to heat up the dispute with europe further - but no more than that .
on the same day as the withdrawal agreement , there were further signs that the conflict is simply moving into a second stage as georgia accused russia of ethnic cleansing at the international court in the hague .
conflict continues sarkozy 's visit is a long way from reaching a solution to the caucasus conflict .
the fundamental problem remains : russia has used georgian aggression against the separatist regime in south ossetia to recognize the independence of the pro-russian regions .
in doing so , moscow has violated the principle of the invulnerability of post-soviet territory borders - also legally - for the first time since the fall of the soviet union 17 years ago .
that does not just mean a dangerous situation for georgia , but a threatening development for peace on the eurasian continent .
that is why a caucasus stability pact is necessary - a pact which russia and the eu are hopefully drawing closer to with the arrangement to send over 200 eu observers to oversee the ceasefire .

ukraine president viktor yushchenko and his foreign minister are due to attend the summit along with president nicolas sarkozy of france , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
kiev 's goal is to become a fully-fledged member of the european union .
before that can happen it must be named an official candidate nation .
but officially at least , the eu sees the country 's political instability as a major sticking-point , as chief foreign policy envoy javier solana made evident in the run-up to the summit in paris , its new location after a last minute change of plans on monday .
" bilateral relations between ukraine and the eu are going in the right direction .
the ukrainian economy is developing well , there is growth , the inflation rate is gradually coming under control .
but we also have our reservations as far as the political situation is concerned .
this needs to stabilize .
parliamentary life has to normalize . "
last week saw the collapse of a shaky coalition between president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , reinforcing the eu 's misgivings about the country 's political situation .
member states also face waning public support for the expansion of the bloc .
fear of antagonizing russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is concerned about political instability in ukraine but ukraine expert amanda akcakoca from the european policy centre , a brussels think-tank , believes that concern about further straining ties with russia is primarily staying the eu 's hand .
" the eu can find a million pretexts , but i think the fear of russia is the main reason .
giving ukraine the prospect of joining the eu , bringing the country closer to the west , does not exactly endear it to moscow .
and that , of course , triggers certain qualms in some eu countries , " she told dw-radio .
at the summit , the eu side is likely to offer to conclude an " association agreement " with ukraine .
a draft declaration prepared by brussels-based diplomats ahead of the eu-ukraine summit says that this would leave open the possibility of further developments between the two sides .
the leaders are also set to announce the launch of a dialogue aimed at eventually achieving a visa-free regime between eu and ukraine . tale of two camps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is a key energy transit route up to now , poland , the czech republic , the nordic states , britain and the baltic states have been broadly positive about embracing ukraine , while germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria have been reluctant to do so .
one sensitive issue is migration .
the benelux countries and spain are fearful of receiving higher numbers of ukrainian workers .
but worries about threatening energy supplies from russia also play a role .
tomas valasek , from the london-based think-tank centre for european reform , told reuters news agency that the european union needed to send a clearer message to ukraine .
he described ukraine as the eu 's most important neighbor given its size , location and its power to influence other countries strategically important in terms of ensuring the security of the eu 's future energy supplies .
" if it can successfully europeanize ... it will clearly demonstrate to the central asian republics , to azerbaijan and to moldova and others that it 's possible to be a former soviet republic and a modern western country , " he said .
" it will show that there is nothing inevitable about former soviet republics always being in the russian orbit .
that 's why it 's important for the eu to get it right . "
akcakoca , of the european policy center , also believes ukrainian accession would be of benefit to the eu .
" it will improve security at the eu 's external borders .
ukraine has a very dynamic economy , a modern army .
ukraine has already taken part in manoeuvres within the auspices of eu security and defense policy on a number of occasions .
i think that up to now the eu has profited more from ukraine than vice versa , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a berlin newspaper quoted a spokesman for the federal office of information matthias gaertner at the weekend saying that the chrome browser " should not be used for general use . "
since then there have been reports that the federal office for information security has issued an official warning against using the new google browser .
but on monday sep .
8 gaertner told the ap news agency that his comments had been taken out of context .
security experts are concerned the chrome browser uses a number for each user that is set up during installation and then communicated to a central server every time the product is in use for the purpose of collecting usage statistics such as details of program crashes .
critics are concerned that the number could be used to identify users .
google rejects security concerns but kay oberbeck , speaking for google , told the dpa news agency : " there are no connections made between the installation number and the entries in the search box or address box . "
the system of attributing a number to each user is not particular to this new google product .
mozilla , the browser of the non-commercial firefox brand , also sends a user number the software company 's server .
another concern about the product is that it collects data from users for use in functions such as the " omnibox " which remembers the topics of previous searches and suggests possible search topics .
google confirms that it saves two percent of data , including users ip addresses .
" this data is necessary to generate the completed search suggestions , " oberbeck explained .
oberbeck also stressed that user information is gathered in a way that makes the users anonymous , and he said that the function can be turned off simply .
critics have also said that , in releasing a test version of the product , google has given users a false sense of security .
" google should have clearly told its users that this is a beta version meant for testing , " daniel bachfeld of the german " c 't " computer magazine told dpa news agency .
spokesman for google germany stefan keuchel said that the beta version was released because it allows for more flexibility in finding bugs , fixing glitches and addressing feedback from users . dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with violent attacks also on the rise , some question whether the country is ready for reconstruction - or still in a state of war . the plans would increase german aid to afghanistan from 140 million to 170 euros -lrb- $ 198-240 million -rrb- .
the funding boost comes amid a surge of violence in the relatively quiet northern regions of afghanistan .
the german government hopes more aid money will make those areas more secure .
" we have to give the -lsb- reconstruction -rsb- process in afghanistan a recognizable face , " german defense minister franz josef jung said at an international security conference in berlin on tuesday , sept 8 .
" we wo n't be able to win this process militarily , " jung added .
moving targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quick reaction force patrols have been subject to increasing attacks near daily attacks in afghanistan underscore how precarious the situation there is .
on tuesday , three us soldiers were killed in the eastern part of the country , bringing the total number of foreign troop casualties in 2008 to 201 .
and the german defense ministry said one of its bases in the northern afghan city of kunduz had come under rocket attack on sunday .
that followed two other militant attacks on saturday - a suicide bombing and a roadside bomb aimed at a convoy of bundeswehr vehicles near mazar-i-sharif .
no soldiers or bystanders were injured in those incidents .
vocabulary of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defence minister jung says his troops are not at war defence minister jung has acknowledged that there have been “ significantly more attacks ” against german soldiers in recent weeks .
but he has insisted that troops serving in afghanistan are not caught up in a “ war . "
the german armed forces federation disagrees with that assessment .
following the death of a young german paratrooper at the end of august and the first civilian casualties at the hands of german soldiers a few days later , the federation 's chairman colonel bernhard gertz told reporters that the mission in afghanistan was nothing other than a " war against a fanatical enemy willing to do anything " .
in october , politicians in berlin are due to debate plans for a new parliamentary mandate that would increase the number of german troops in afghanistan from 3,500 to 4,500 .
" so many mistakes " as the world remembers the seventh anniversary of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks this week , escalating violence in afghanistan , which was invaded by a us-led coalition force two months after the attacks , has many worried .
the former eu envoy to afghanistan on tuesday slammed nato and us-led operations in the country , saying there is no coherent strategy and progress is unlikely while george w. bush remains us president . in a bbc interview to be aired tuesday , francesc vendrell lamented that " so many mistakes " were made after the us-led invasion in 2001 and warned that mounting civilian casualties were undermining support for the coalition . vandrell said the west had no coherent strategy for victory in afghanistan , adding the bush adminstration did not want to make any changes because they want to present the country as a success story . " we will need to wait , not for very long , for a new administration to be established and at that point we need to reveal our strategy , not only a us strategy but the overall strategy , because clearly what we are doing so far is not going to lead to success , " vandrell said . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the device is to be manufactured in germany . the as-yet-unnamed device is the size of a piece of standard printer paper and the screen allows users to annotate documents and will offer the option of embedding video .
the new invention was shown off at an industry event called demofall in san diego .
it is due to go on sale early next year and is expected to be embraced by newspaper publishers eager to cut the costs associated with printing and distributing paper editions .
the device uses technology from e-ink , the company that also powers electronic readers from sony and amazon .
but the screen of the plastic logic gadget is built with transistor arrays on flexible plastic surfaces that are lighter , stronger , less expensive and more environmentally friendly than the silicon-based systems in use until now .
the plastic reader is designed to store dozens or hundreds of business documents on a very thin digital reader .
it can store e-books , magazines , newspapers , pdf files and all kinds of information , the company said .
" even though we have positioned this for business documents , newspapers -lrb- are -rrb- what everyone asks for , " said richard archuleta , plastic logic 's ceo .
the company is due to open the world 's first commercial-scale plastic electronics manufacturing facility in dresden on sep .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 09.09.2008 carbon capture plant opens in germany amid reservations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant in eastern germany , near the polish border is the only one of its kind in the world energy giant vattenfall has launched an emissions-free coal-fired test plant near berlin using a technology touted as a huge potential breakthrough in the fight against global warming .
but critics are n't convinced . swedish energy utility vattenfall sees carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- as a revolutionary answer to global warming which is largely blamed on carbon dioxide released when fossil fuels burn .
" this technology will become more important than offshore wind farms , " said vattenfall boss lars josefsson .
" our project at schwarze pumpe puts us at the forefront of this technology in the world , " said tuomo hatakka , the chief executive of vattenfall europe , referring to the the 70-million euro plant in eastern germany .
vattenfall , one of europe 's largest energy companies , hopes the project will help provide energy security through plentiful coal supplies while avoiding the co2 emissions that are blamed for global warming .
vattenfall underscores " clean technology " aspect a finnish-born executive who heads the swedish group 's berlin-based subsidiary , hatakka told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the process was viable because companies will have to buy eu allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ccs test plant has drawn prominent visitors including chancellor merkel " in tandem with eu-wide trading in emission rights , ccs will be economic .
at 30 to 35 euros per emission certificate , the technology breaks even , " he said .
the 30-megawatt pilot plant at schwarze pumpe in the lausitz region of eastern germany is very small compared to conventional power stations .
but it 's the first coal-fired power plant in the world ready to capture and store its own carbon dioxide emissions - a so-called ccs plant .
carbon dioxide emitted when lignite coal burns will not be vented up a chimney but piped away , compressed to a liquid and pumped into deep , porous rock .
the concentrated carbon dioxide will then be injected " for permanent storage " in a gas field in northern germany .
vattenfall plans to build two " demonstration plants " 10 times that size in germany and denmark by 2015 at the latest .
hatakka said the company aimed to commission its first " large-scale ccs power station " in 2020 .
the outcome of this new plant will be heat , water vapor , nine tons of co2 per hour and a milestone in clean energy technology , according to markus füller , a spokesman for vattenfall .
“ this process is necessary if we ever hope to continue using soft , lignite coal , he says .
we need to get a handle on the co2 problem , and we think this technology is the way to do it , " füller said .
critics are n't convinced but environmentalists say the technology uses far more energy than existing power generation and warn that there are no secure long-term storage facilities for the gas .
german conservation group bund on monday denounced the project as simply a cover allowing vattenfall to expand its network of conventional coal-fired power stations in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say the focus should be on expanding cheaper renewable energy rather than on polluting coal thorben becker of bund said it was still uncertain if ccs worked on a large scale .
ccs power stations would obtain 10 per cent less power from the coal than conventional plants did , and it was not clear if there were enough suitable sites to dump the co2 .
" instead of concentrating on far cheaper renewable energy , vattenfall is locking itself in for decades to converting climate-damaging brown coal into electricity , " he said .
the european union wants to have 10 or 12 full-scale ccs power stations within the next few years , but it is not clear who will pay the high costs of building and running the plants . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is this a case of a state guarding a company against free competition ? the eu is set to try to end a long-running dispute over whether a german law giving the state of lower saxony veto powers in vw 's affairs is in violation of the block competition rules .
the eu has been trying to get germany 's federal government to scrap or revise the so-called " vw law " - which privileges lower saxony despite that state possessing less than the 25 percent of shares normally required for a veto - since 2004 .
the european court of justice ruled the 48-year-old law invalid last october .
it was subsequently revised , but not enough to satisfy the bloc .
" the facts are clear - they 're not changing their positions , " said a spokesman for eu internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy in a statement .
eu legal action would begin " as soon as possible , " added the spokesman .

the vw law was enacted in 1960 to allow the state government to protect germany 's largest carmaker from foreign takeover .
but it has come under increasing criticism in recent years , especially from porsche .
despite being smaller than the vw , the profitable , luxury-oriented company would like to take over the giant carmaker .

through the abandonment of the negotiations over a partnership and cooperation settlement between the eu and russia , a unanimous europe has made it clear that it does not seek partnership with russia at any price .
that is how the eu has succeeded in making russia give in without having to use rhetoric to heat up the dispute .
the europeans ' calm , mediating politics has thus brought them a small symbolic win .
moscow 's clever chess tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel russia 's acceptance was , however , a clever chess tactic by president medvedev , since , in withdrawing its troops from the buffer zones , russia actually does not lose much ground .
the withdrawal plays no part regarding military strategy : russian army units continue to secure the renegade regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
neither has russia lost out from a diplomatic or political perspective : russia continues to disregard the principle of georgia 's territorial integrity by its recognition of abkhazian and south ossetian independence .
russia 's agreement to europe 's demand of withdrawing troops from the buffer zone should therefore not be seen as a political turning point in the caucasus conflict .
it is much more a symbolic gesture to europe .
russia has also made the decision not to heat up the dispute with europe further - but no more than that .
on the same day as the withdrawal agreement , there were further signs that the conflict is simply moving into a second stage as georgia accused russia of ethnic cleansing at the international court in the hague .
conflict continues sarkozy 's visit is a long way from reaching a solution to the caucasus conflict .
the fundamental problem remains : russia has used georgian aggression against the separatist regime in south ossetia to recognize the independence of the pro-russian regions .
in doing so , moscow has violated the principle of the invulnerability of post-soviet territory borders - also legally - for the first time since the fall of the soviet union 17 years ago .
that does not just mean a dangerous situation for georgia , but a threatening development for peace on the eurasian continent .
that is why a caucasus stability pact is necessary - a pact which russia and the eu are hopefully drawing closer to with the arrangement to send over 200 eu observers to oversee the ceasefire .

through the abandonment of the negotiations over a partnership and cooperation settlement between the eu and russia , a unanimous europe has made it clear that it does not seek partnership with russia at any price .
that is how the eu has succeeded in making russia give in without having to use rhetoric to heat up the dispute .

moscow 's clever chess tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel russia 's acceptance was , however , a clever chess tactic by president medvedev , since , in withdrawing its troops from the buffer zones , russia actually does not lose much ground .
the withdrawal plays no part regarding military strategy : russian army units continue to secure the renegade regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
neither has russia lost out from a diplomatic or political perspective : russia continues to disregard the principle of georgia 's territorial integrity by its recognition of abkhazian and south ossetian independence .
russia 's agreement to europe 's demand of withdrawing troops from the buffer zone should therefore not be seen as a political turning point in the caucasus conflict .
it is much more a symbolic gesture to europe .
russia has also made the decision not to heat up the dispute with europe further - but no more than that .
on the same day as the withdrawal agreement , there were further signs that the conflict is simply moving into a second stage as georgia accused russia of ethnic cleansing at the international court in the hague .
conflict continues sarkozy 's visit is a long way from reaching a solution to the caucasus conflict .
the fundamental problem remains : russia has used georgian aggression against the separatist regime in south ossetia to recognize the independence of the pro-russian regions .
in doing so , moscow has violated the principle of the invulnerability of post-soviet territory borders - also legally - for the first time since the fall of the soviet union 17 years ago .
that does not just mean a dangerous situation for georgia , but a threatening development for peace on the eurasian continent .
that is why a caucasus stability pact is necessary - a pact which russia and the eu are hopefully drawing closer to with the arrangement to send over 200 eu observers to oversee the ceasefire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 09.09.2008 teams try to avoid dreaded bad start when season resumes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker mikael forssell is not yet a hanover helper many players are still with their national sides , but some bundesliga clubs are worrying about the season restart .
the week after the first break is traditionally when fans begin to get angry and coaches lose their jobs . the first few weeks of the season are like the initial ninety days of a new head of state 's term of office .
voters - or in the case of soccer , supporters - are willing to overlook fumbles and bumbles as part of the settling-in process .
but once the league emerges from its first break , club management and fans expect results .
and that puts serious pressure on the clubs who 've yet to chalk up a win .
hanover , in particular , will be feeling the heat .
touted by many observers in the pre-season as a possible top-five squad , they failed to score a goal in their first three matches and currently occupy the bottom spot in the table .
hanover coach dieter hecking has promised a turn-around this weekend against moenchengladbach .
but should he fail to get three points at home against a newly promoted opponent , his ears will be ringing with the one word all german coaches hate most - fehlstart .
more than just a bad beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus ' season has gotten off with a whimper fehlstart is , on the surface , just the german for bad beginning .
but in the culture of the bundesliga , it 's much more than that , something approaching an existential state of awfulness that can only be remedied with personnel changes .
and since the transfer window is closed , the only big move a club can make is firing the coach .
bojan prasnikar knows the score .
last september , he took over at energie cottbus after the small eastern german club had earned only two points from its first seven games .
now , he 's the one who 's having to answer endless fehlstart questions from baying-for-blood reporters , as cottbus has also failed to score and are tied at the bottom on one point .
but it 's unlikely prasnikar will be able to reverse energie 's fortunes straight away .
he 's going up this weekend against one of the bundesliga 's heavy hitters - and a team that 's fighting a fehlstart of its own .
quo vadis , werder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's schaaf wishes he could turn back time it 's no surprise to find the likes of bochum and bielefeld near the bottom and heading toward another season of merely battling for survival .
but werder bremen 's form has been shocking .
the side that usually plays the bundesliga 's most attractive football is off to its worst start in nine years , earning only a pair of draws and dropping five points to mediocre opposition .
having been at bremen 's helm for a decade , thomas schaaf is probably unfireable unless the bottom totally drops out .
but if they fail to hammer cottbus , expect changes to the squad - with ageing captain frank baumann looking to be a prime candidate for replacement .
werder are five points adrift of a spot in the champions league .
there 's plenty of time left to close that gap , but a disappointing result against massive underdogs cottbus would have fans and management asking some unpleasant existential questions about whether this squad is still truly among the bundesliga 's elite . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bojan prasnikar knows the score .
last september , he took over at energie cottbus after the small eastern german club had earned only two points from its first seven games .
now , he 's the one who 's having to answer endless fehlstart questions from baying-for-blood reporters , as cottbus has also failed to score and are tied at the bottom on one point .
but it 's unlikely prasnikar will be able to reverse energie 's fortunes straight away .
he 's going up this weekend against one of the bundesliga 's heavy hitters - and a team that 's fighting a fehlstart of its own .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 09.09.2008 german official warns against new google browser großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the introduction of google chrome has been long anticipated in a newspaper interview a spokesman for germany 's federal office for information security spoke of potential risks in using google 's new " chrome " browser in its current beta version , sparking a debate in germany . a debate over data protection has begun in germany just one week after the introduction of google 's new browser .
a berlin newspaper quoted a spokesman for the federal office of information matthias gaertner at the weekend saying that the chrome browser " should not be used for general use . "
since then there have been reports that the federal office for information security has issued an official warning against using the new google browser .
but on monday sep .
8 gaertner told the ap news agency that his comments had been taken out of context .
security experts are concerned the chrome browser uses a number for each user that is set up during installation and then communicated to a central server every time the product is in use for the purpose of collecting usage statistics such as details of program crashes .
critics are concerned that the number could be used to identify users .
google rejects security concerns but kay oberbeck , speaking for google , told the dpa news agency : " there are no connections made between the installation number and the entries in the search box or address box . "

critics are concerned that the number could be used to identify users .
google rejects security concerns but kay oberbeck , speaking for google , told the dpa news agency : " there are no connections made between the installation number and the entries in the search box or address box . "
the system of attributing a number to each user is not particular to this new google product .
mozilla , the browser of the non-commercial firefox brand , also sends a user number the software company 's server .
another concern about the product is that it collects data from users for use in functions such as the " omnibox " which remembers the topics of previous searches and suggests possible search topics .
google confirms that it saves two percent of data , including users ip addresses .
" this data is necessary to generate the completed search suggestions , " oberbeck explained .
oberbeck also stressed that user information is gathered in a way that makes the users anonymous , and he said that the function can be turned off simply .
critics have also said that , in releasing a test version of the product , google has given users a false sense of security .
" google should have clearly told its users that this is a beta version meant for testing , " daniel bachfeld of the german " c 't " computer magazine told dpa news agency .
spokesman for google germany stefan keuchel said that the beta version was released because it allows for more flexibility in finding bugs , fixing glitches and addressing feedback from users . dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there were several countries that put critical questions to india , but also the united states , about how this arrangement is compatible with the common goal of nuclear non-proliferation , " ploetner told a news conference on monday , sept 8 .
" it is not an ideal solution .
the negotiations were very difficult and we can not say that we could not have imagined something better . "
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- is a group of 45 states that control the international sale of nuclear technology .
the deal with india is a key step in sealing the india-us atomic technology accord signed by us president george w. bush and indian premier manmohan singh in 2005 .
the us-india business council , one of the champions of the pact between new delhi and washington , said the nsg 's decision could unlock nuclear energy investment in india worth more than $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- .
the controversial agreement , signed on saturday , sept .
6 , means germany and other states can start jostling for a strong position in the race to sell nuclear know-how and technology to india .
a controversial decision the us had been hoping for a quick decision on the embargo , so that the current us congress could ratify the accord before elections in november .
us lawmakers are pushing for a vote by the end of september .
the decision to lift the embargo was controversial , in part because india - which was embargoed in the first place after it developed and tested nuclear weapons test in 1974 - has so far refused to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and singh signed a nukes deal in 2005 the us exerted the most pressure on the nsg to lift the embargo .
it argues that cooperation in the civilian nuclear sector could bring india closer to signing on to the international nuclear non proliferation treaty , and that an increase in atomic energy sources will help in the fight against global warming .
but critics - such as austria , ireland and new zealand , supported by china - warned that india is being rewarded for its long-time insistence on a right to nuclear technology ; they fear india could use atomic technology for military ends .
moreover , the nsg stance undermines its negotiating power when it comes to dealing with states such as iran and pakistan , opponents argue .
germany shows grudging acceptance the last nsg member state to finally agree to lift the india embargo was austria .
it signed only after india formally decreed it would adhere to a moratorium on further atomic-bomb tests .
germany , which currently chairs the nsg , expressed grudging acceptance of the landmark atomic energy deal .
it , too , denied the accord undermines the west 's efforts to convince iran to stop sensitive nuclear work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's ahmadinejad wants to expand his program asked whether the pact contradicted the west 's united opposition to iran 's controversial nuclear program , ploetner told afp news service that the nuclear suppliers group had underscored the goal of non-proliferation with the agreement .
germany : iaea approval was key " does this agreement send an approving message to iran ?
no , it absolutely does not , " ploetner said , calling india a " special case . "
ploetner added that the approval of the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , the vienna-based international atomic energy agency , had been decisive in winning approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting the iaea to sign on was a key part of the deal germany is among six countries working to convince tehran to abandon uranium enrichment , which the west fears is a pretense for building an iranian nuclear weapon .
iran says its nuclear program is for civilian purposes only .
jostling for contracts has begun meanwhile , the us forecasts that india 's growing energy needs mean it will have to build at least eight new atomic energy plants by 2012 .
britain , france and russia have already joined the us in jostling for lucrative contracts .
and during the celebration of the 50th anniversary of a german-supported technical university earlier this week in chennai , india , german technology minister annette schavan was warmly greeted by her indian counterpart kipal sibal .
" we have to see the next 50 years of cooperation in the light of the events of this past weekend , " sibal said at the celebration .

" there were several countries that put critical questions to india , but also the united states , about how this arrangement is compatible with the common goal of nuclear non-proliferation , " ploetner told a news conference on monday , sept 8 .

the deal with india is a key step in sealing the india-us atomic technology accord signed by us president george w. bush and indian premier manmohan singh in 2005 .
the us-india business council , one of the champions of the pact between new delhi and washington , said the nsg 's decision could unlock nuclear energy investment in india worth more than $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- .

a controversial decision the us had been hoping for a quick decision on the embargo , so that the current us congress could ratify the accord before elections in november .
us lawmakers are pushing for a vote by the end of september .
the decision to lift the embargo was controversial , in part because india - which was embargoed in the first place after it developed and tested nuclear weapons test in 1974 - has so far refused to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .

but critics are n't convinced . swedish energy utility vattenfall sees carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- as a revolutionary answer to global warming which is largely blamed on carbon dioxide released when fossil fuels burn .
" this technology will become more important than offshore wind farms , " said vattenfall boss lars josefsson .
" our project at schwarze pumpe puts us at the forefront of this technology in the world , " said tuomo hatakka , the chief executive of vattenfall europe , referring to the the 70-million euro plant in eastern germany .
vattenfall , one of europe 's largest energy companies , hopes the project will help provide energy security through plentiful coal supplies while avoiding the co2 emissions that are blamed for global warming .
vattenfall underscores " clean technology " aspect a finnish-born executive who heads the swedish group 's berlin-based subsidiary , hatakka told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the process was viable because companies will have to buy eu allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ccs test plant has drawn prominent visitors including chancellor merkel " in tandem with eu-wide trading in emission rights , ccs will be economic .
at 30 to 35 euros per emission certificate , the technology breaks even , " he said .
the 30-megawatt pilot plant at schwarze pumpe in the lausitz region of eastern germany is very small compared to conventional power stations .
but it 's the first coal-fired power plant in the world ready to capture and store its own carbon dioxide emissions - a so-called ccs plant .
carbon dioxide emitted when lignite coal burns will not be vented up a chimney but piped away , compressed to a liquid and pumped into deep , porous rock .
the concentrated carbon dioxide will then be injected " for permanent storage " in a gas field in northern germany .
vattenfall plans to build two " demonstration plants " 10 times that size in germany and denmark by 2015 at the latest .
hatakka said the company aimed to commission its first " large-scale ccs power station " in 2020 .
the outcome of this new plant will be heat , water vapor , nine tons of co2 per hour and a milestone in clean energy technology , according to markus füller , a spokesman for vattenfall .
“ this process is necessary if we ever hope to continue using soft , lignite coal , he says .
we need to get a handle on the co2 problem , and we think this technology is the way to do it , " füller said .
critics are n't convinced but environmentalists say the technology uses far more energy than existing power generation and warn that there are no secure long-term storage facilities for the gas .
german conservation group bund on monday denounced the project as simply a cover allowing vattenfall to expand its network of conventional coal-fired power stations in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say the focus should be on expanding cheaper renewable energy rather than on polluting coal thorben becker of bund said it was still uncertain if ccs worked on a large scale .
ccs power stations would obtain 10 per cent less power from the coal than conventional plants did , and it was not clear if there were enough suitable sites to dump the co2 .
" instead of concentrating on far cheaper renewable energy , vattenfall is locking itself in for decades to converting climate-damaging brown coal into electricity , " he said .
the european union wants to have 10 or 12 full-scale ccs power stations within the next few years , but it is not clear who will pay the high costs of building and running the plants . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics are n't convinced . swedish energy utility vattenfall sees carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- as a revolutionary answer to global warming which is largely blamed on carbon dioxide released when fossil fuels burn .
" this technology will become more important than offshore wind farms , " said vattenfall boss lars josefsson .
" our project at schwarze pumpe puts us at the forefront of this technology in the world , " said tuomo hatakka , the chief executive of vattenfall europe , referring to the the 70-million euro plant in eastern germany .
vattenfall , one of europe 's largest energy companies , hopes the project will help provide energy security through plentiful coal supplies while avoiding the co2 emissions that are blamed for global warming .
vattenfall underscores " clean technology " aspect a finnish-born executive who heads the swedish group 's berlin-based subsidiary , hatakka told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the process was viable because companies will have to buy eu allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ccs test plant has drawn prominent visitors including chancellor merkel " in tandem with eu-wide trading in emission rights , ccs will be economic .
at 30 to 35 euros per emission certificate , the technology breaks even , " he said .
the 30-megawatt pilot plant at schwarze pumpe in the lausitz region of eastern germany is very small compared to conventional power stations .
but it 's the first coal-fired power plant in the world ready to capture and store its own carbon dioxide emissions - a so-called ccs plant .
carbon dioxide emitted when lignite coal burns will not be vented up a chimney but piped away , compressed to a liquid and pumped into deep , porous rock .
the concentrated carbon dioxide will then be injected " for permanent storage " in a gas field in northern germany .
vattenfall plans to build two " demonstration plants " 10 times that size in germany and denmark by 2015 at the latest .
hatakka said the company aimed to commission its first " large-scale ccs power station " in 2020 .
the outcome of this new plant will be heat , water vapor , nine tons of co2 per hour and a milestone in clean energy technology , according to markus füller , a spokesman for vattenfall .
“ this process is necessary if we ever hope to continue using soft , lignite coal , he says .
we need to get a handle on the co2 problem , and we think this technology is the way to do it , " füller said .
critics are n't convinced but environmentalists say the technology uses far more energy than existing power generation and warn that there are no secure long-term storage facilities for the gas .
german conservation group bund on monday denounced the project as simply a cover allowing vattenfall to expand its network of conventional coal-fired power stations in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say the focus should be on expanding cheaper renewable energy rather than on polluting coal thorben becker of bund said it was still uncertain if ccs worked on a large scale .
ccs power stations would obtain 10 per cent less power from the coal than conventional plants did , and it was not clear if there were enough suitable sites to dump the co2 .
" instead of concentrating on far cheaper renewable energy , vattenfall is locking itself in for decades to converting climate-damaging brown coal into electricity , " he said .
the european union wants to have 10 or 12 full-scale ccs power stations within the next few years , but it is not clear who will pay the high costs of building and running the plants . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the device is to be manufactured in germany . the as-yet-unnamed device is the size of a piece of standard printer paper and the screen allows users to annotate documents and will offer the option of embedding video .
the new invention was shown off at an industry event called demofall in san diego .
it is due to go on sale early next year and is expected to be embraced by newspaper publishers eager to cut the costs associated with printing and distributing paper editions .
the device uses technology from e-ink , the company that also powers electronic readers from sony and amazon .
but the screen of the plastic logic gadget is built with transistor arrays on flexible plastic surfaces that are lighter , stronger , less expensive and more environmentally friendly than the silicon-based systems in use until now .
the plastic reader is designed to store dozens or hundreds of business documents on a very thin digital reader .
it can store e-books , magazines , newspapers , pdf files and all kinds of information , the company said .
" even though we have positioned this for business documents , newspapers -lrb- are -rrb- what everyone asks for , " said richard archuleta , plastic logic 's ceo .

" we are a european country , our place is in europe , " konstyantyn gryshchenko said in brussels , on the eve of an eu-ukraine summit in paris on tuesday , sept 9 .
ukraine president viktor yushchenko and his foreign minister are due to attend the summit along with president nicolas sarkozy of france , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
kiev 's goal is to become a fully-fledged member of the european union .

" we are a european country , our place is in europe , " konstyantyn gryshchenko said in brussels , on the eve of an eu-ukraine summit in paris on tuesday , sept 9 .
ukraine president viktor yushchenko and his foreign minister are due to attend the summit along with president nicolas sarkozy of france , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
kiev 's goal is to become a fully-fledged member of the european union .

giving ukraine the prospect of joining the eu , bringing the country closer to the west , does not exactly endear it to moscow .

at the summit , the eu side is likely to offer to conclude an " association agreement " with ukraine .

but the bloc did not mention concrete security guarantees or membership prospects . probably the most heartening words from the summit for ukrainian president viktor yushchenko came at the concluding press conference , when summit chairman and french president nicolas sarkozy said that , in the eyes of europe , ukrainian territorial integrity was " non-negotiable . "
the meeting between yushchenko and representatives form the eu 's 27 member states came in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict and amidst ukrainian worries about moscow 's motives .
in a joint statement , eu member states " recognized that ukraine , as a european country , shares a common history and common values with the countries of the eu . "
the " association agreement " that emerged form the summit offers kiev enhanced status in its dealings with the eu .
but it does not say anything about whether ukraine could possibly join the bloc some day .
indeed the agreement , as sarkozy stressed to the press , " neither opens nor closes any route . "
for his part , yushchenko told reporters he was convinced that his country and the eu would sign " a very symbolic document cementing relations . "
" the main thing is that today we qualified as a european country , " yushchenko added .
" this is the first step of this great road that all countries which then became eu members , walked on . "
european divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian-georgian conflict has everyone worried about eastern europe but if the post-summit tone was warm , the statements and the agreement emerging from the meeting reflected the fact that the eu is not at all of a single mind as to where it stands vis-à-vis ukraine and russia .
" there are differing positions within the european council , " sarkozy said .
" and we explained to president yushchenko that this was the maximum we could promise him . "
britain , poland and sweden have been pushing the bloc to deepen ties with kiev to offset pressure from moscow .
but member states like germany , italy and the benelux countries want the eu to be more cautious and take more account of russia 's interests in eastern europe .
there are even questions as to whether the people of ukraine , with its heavy russian-speaking population , would truly welcome a more hard-line course toward moscow . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is this a case of a state guarding a company against free competition ? the eu is set to try to end a long-running dispute over whether a german law giving the state of lower saxony veto powers in vw 's affairs is in violation of the block competition rules .
the eu has been trying to get germany 's federal government to scrap or revise the so-called " vw law " - which privileges lower saxony despite that state possessing less than the 25 percent of shares normally required for a veto - since 2004 .
the european court of justice ruled the 48-year-old law invalid last october .
it was subsequently revised , but not enough to satisfy the bloc .
" the facts are clear - they 're not changing their positions , " said a spokesman for eu internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy in a statement .
eu legal action would begin " as soon as possible , " added the spokesman .
porsche to benefit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw is one of germany 's most recognizable brands officials for lower saxony in the city of hanover had no comment on the proposed legal action , other than to say that mccreedy 's position was known .
the vw law was enacted in 1960 to allow the state government to protect germany 's largest carmaker from foreign takeover .
but it has come under increasing criticism in recent years , especially from porsche .
despite being smaller than the vw , the profitable , luxury-oriented company would like to take over the giant carmaker .
" this is completely in line with our thinking , " said a spokesman for porsche , which holds over 30 percent of voting rights in vw .
" we are firmly convinced there 's no need for a vw law . "
germany 's economic minister michael glos has also said he believes that the vw law is unnecessary and that the blocking clause favoring lower saxony could be removed .
unions representing vw workers , however , have been vocal in their support for the law , saying it protected the interests of employees . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are a european country , our place is in europe , " konstyantyn gryshchenko said in brussels , on the eve of an eu-ukraine summit in paris on tuesday , sept 9 .
ukraine president viktor yushchenko and his foreign minister are due to attend the summit along with president nicolas sarkozy of france , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
kiev 's goal is to become a fully-fledged member of the european union .
before that can happen it must be named an official candidate nation .
but officially at least , the eu sees the country 's political instability as a major sticking-point , as chief foreign policy envoy javier solana made evident in the run-up to the summit in paris , its new location after a last minute change of plans on monday .
" bilateral relations between ukraine and the eu are going in the right direction .
the ukrainian economy is developing well , there is growth , the inflation rate is gradually coming under control .
but we also have our reservations as far as the political situation is concerned .
this needs to stabilize .
parliamentary life has to normalize . "
last week saw the collapse of a shaky coalition between president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , reinforcing the eu 's misgivings about the country 's political situation .
member states also face waning public support for the expansion of the bloc .
fear of antagonizing russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is concerned about political instability in ukraine but ukraine expert amanda akcakoca from the european policy centre , a brussels think-tank , believes that concern about further straining ties with russia is primarily staying the eu 's hand .
" the eu can find a million pretexts , but i think the fear of russia is the main reason .
giving ukraine the prospect of joining the eu , bringing the country closer to the west , does not exactly endear it to moscow .
and that , of course , triggers certain qualms in some eu countries , " she told dw-radio .
at the summit , the eu side is likely to offer to conclude an " association agreement " with ukraine .
a draft declaration prepared by brussels-based diplomats ahead of the eu-ukraine summit says that this would leave open the possibility of further developments between the two sides .
the leaders are also set to announce the launch of a dialogue aimed at eventually achieving a visa-free regime between eu and ukraine . tale of two camps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is a key energy transit route up to now , poland , the czech republic , the nordic states , britain and the baltic states have been broadly positive about embracing ukraine , while germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria have been reluctant to do so .
one sensitive issue is migration .
the benelux countries and spain are fearful of receiving higher numbers of ukrainian workers .
but worries about threatening energy supplies from russia also play a role .
tomas valasek , from the london-based think-tank centre for european reform , told reuters news agency that the european union needed to send a clearer message to ukraine .
he described ukraine as the eu 's most important neighbor given its size , location and its power to influence other countries strategically important in terms of ensuring the security of the eu 's future energy supplies .
" if it can successfully europeanize ... it will clearly demonstrate to the central asian republics , to azerbaijan and to moldova and others that it 's possible to be a former soviet republic and a modern western country , " he said .
" it will show that there is nothing inevitable about former soviet republics always being in the russian orbit .
that 's why it 's important for the eu to get it right . "
akcakoca , of the european policy center , also believes ukrainian accession would be of benefit to the eu .
" it will improve security at the eu 's external borders .
ukraine has a very dynamic economy , a modern army .
ukraine has already taken part in manoeuvres within the auspices of eu security and defense policy on a number of occasions .
i think that up to now the eu has profited more from ukraine than vice versa , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the device is to be manufactured in germany . the as-yet-unnamed device is the size of a piece of standard printer paper and the screen allows users to annotate documents and will offer the option of embedding video .
the new invention was shown off at an industry event called demofall in san diego .
it is due to go on sale early next year and is expected to be embraced by newspaper publishers eager to cut the costs associated with printing and distributing paper editions .
the device uses technology from e-ink , the company that also powers electronic readers from sony and amazon .

the plastic reader is designed to store dozens or hundreds of business documents on a very thin digital reader .
it can store e-books , magazines , newspapers , pdf files and all kinds of information , the company said .
" even though we have positioned this for business documents , newspapers -lrb- are -rrb- what everyone asks for , " said richard archuleta , plastic logic 's ceo .

but critics are n't convinced . swedish energy utility vattenfall sees carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- as a revolutionary answer to global warming which is largely blamed on carbon dioxide released when fossil fuels burn .
" this technology will become more important than offshore wind farms , " said vattenfall boss lars josefsson .
" our project at schwarze pumpe puts us at the forefront of this technology in the world , " said tuomo hatakka , the chief executive of vattenfall europe , referring to the the 70-million euro plant in eastern germany .
vattenfall , one of europe 's largest energy companies , hopes the project will help provide energy security through plentiful coal supplies while avoiding the co2 emissions that are blamed for global warming .
vattenfall underscores " clean technology " aspect a finnish-born executive who heads the swedish group 's berlin-based subsidiary , hatakka told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the process was viable because companies will have to buy eu allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ccs test plant has drawn prominent visitors including chancellor merkel " in tandem with eu-wide trading in emission rights , ccs will be economic .
at 30 to 35 euros per emission certificate , the technology breaks even , " he said .
the 30-megawatt pilot plant at schwarze pumpe in the lausitz region of eastern germany is very small compared to conventional power stations .
but it 's the first coal-fired power plant in the world ready to capture and store its own carbon dioxide emissions - a so-called ccs plant .
carbon dioxide emitted when lignite coal burns will not be vented up a chimney but piped away , compressed to a liquid and pumped into deep , porous rock .
the concentrated carbon dioxide will then be injected " for permanent storage " in a gas field in northern germany .
vattenfall plans to build two " demonstration plants " 10 times that size in germany and denmark by 2015 at the latest .
hatakka said the company aimed to commission its first " large-scale ccs power station " in 2020 .
the outcome of this new plant will be heat , water vapor , nine tons of co2 per hour and a milestone in clean energy technology , according to markus füller , a spokesman for vattenfall .
“ this process is necessary if we ever hope to continue using soft , lignite coal , he says .
we need to get a handle on the co2 problem , and we think this technology is the way to do it , " füller said .
critics are n't convinced but environmentalists say the technology uses far more energy than existing power generation and warn that there are no secure long-term storage facilities for the gas .
german conservation group bund on monday denounced the project as simply a cover allowing vattenfall to expand its network of conventional coal-fired power stations in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say the focus should be on expanding cheaper renewable energy rather than on polluting coal thorben becker of bund said it was still uncertain if ccs worked on a large scale .
ccs power stations would obtain 10 per cent less power from the coal than conventional plants did , and it was not clear if there were enough suitable sites to dump the co2 .
" instead of concentrating on far cheaper renewable energy , vattenfall is locking itself in for decades to converting climate-damaging brown coal into electricity , " he said .
the european union wants to have 10 or 12 full-scale ccs power stations within the next few years , but it is not clear who will pay the high costs of building and running the plants . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 09.09.2008 eu to offer cautious support for ukraine 's candidacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paris summit is not set to mark a rite of passage for kiev the european union is expected to offer ukraine encouragement about closer ties but will stop short of making any firm commitments on future membership at a summit in paris on tuesday . in the light of the crisis between russia and georgia in the caucasus and fears of a resurgent russia , ukraine has no option but to join the european union eventually , and the bloc should say so to help the country 's leaders continue long-term reforms , kiev 's ambassador to moscow said monday .
" we are a european country , our place is in europe , " konstyantyn gryshchenko said in brussels , on the eve of an eu-ukraine summit in paris on tuesday , sept 9 .
ukraine president viktor yushchenko and his foreign minister are due to attend the summit along with president nicolas sarkozy of france , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
kiev 's goal is to become a fully-fledged member of the european union .
before that can happen it must be named an official candidate nation .
but officially at least , the eu sees the country 's political instability as a major sticking-point , as chief foreign policy envoy javier solana made evident in the run-up to the summit in paris , its new location after a last minute change of plans on monday .
" bilateral relations between ukraine and the eu are going in the right direction .
the ukrainian economy is developing well , there is growth , the inflation rate is gradually coming under control .
but we also have our reservations as far as the political situation is concerned .
this needs to stabilize .
parliamentary life has to normalize . "
last week saw the collapse of a shaky coalition between president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , reinforcing the eu 's misgivings about the country 's political situation .
member states also face waning public support for the expansion of the bloc .
fear of antagonizing russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is concerned about political instability in ukraine but ukraine expert amanda akcakoca from the european policy centre , a brussels think-tank , believes that concern about further straining ties with russia is primarily staying the eu 's hand .
" the eu can find a million pretexts , but i think the fear of russia is the main reason .
giving ukraine the prospect of joining the eu , bringing the country closer to the west , does not exactly endear it to moscow .
and that , of course , triggers certain qualms in some eu countries , " she told dw-radio .
at the summit , the eu side is likely to offer to conclude an " association agreement " with ukraine .
a draft declaration prepared by brussels-based diplomats ahead of the eu-ukraine summit says that this would leave open the possibility of further developments between the two sides .
the leaders are also set to announce the launch of a dialogue aimed at eventually achieving a visa-free regime between eu and ukraine . tale of two camps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is a key energy transit route up to now , poland , the czech republic , the nordic states , britain and the baltic states have been broadly positive about embracing ukraine , while germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria have been reluctant to do so .
one sensitive issue is migration .
the benelux countries and spain are fearful of receiving higher numbers of ukrainian workers .
but worries about threatening energy supplies from russia also play a role .
tomas valasek , from the london-based think-tank centre for european reform , told reuters news agency that the european union needed to send a clearer message to ukraine .
he described ukraine as the eu 's most important neighbor given its size , location and its power to influence other countries strategically important in terms of ensuring the security of the eu 's future energy supplies .
" if it can successfully europeanize ... it will clearly demonstrate to the central asian republics , to azerbaijan and to moldova and others that it 's possible to be a former soviet republic and a modern western country , " he said .
" it will show that there is nothing inevitable about former soviet republics always being in the russian orbit .
that 's why it 's important for the eu to get it right . "
akcakoca , of the european policy center , also believes ukrainian accession would be of benefit to the eu .
" it will improve security at the eu 's external borders .
ukraine has a very dynamic economy , a modern army .
ukraine has already taken part in manoeuvres within the auspices of eu security and defense policy on a number of occasions .
i think that up to now the eu has profited more from ukraine than vice versa , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our project at schwarze pumpe puts us at the forefront of this technology in the world , " said tuomo hatakka , the chief executive of vattenfall europe , referring to the the 70-million euro plant in eastern germany .
vattenfall , one of europe 's largest energy companies , hopes the project will help provide energy security through plentiful coal supplies while avoiding the co2 emissions that are blamed for global warming .
vattenfall underscores " clean technology " aspect a finnish-born executive who heads the swedish group 's berlin-based subsidiary , hatakka told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the process was viable because companies will have to buy eu allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the air .

“ this process is necessary if we ever hope to continue using soft , lignite coal , he says .
we need to get a handle on the co2 problem , and we think this technology is the way to do it , " füller said .
critics are n't convinced but environmentalists say the technology uses far more energy than existing power generation and warn that there are no secure long-term storage facilities for the gas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 09.09.2008 germany grudgingly accepts landmark nuclear deal with india großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the deal with india is a setback for nuclear non-proliferation efforts germany has grudgingly accepted a landmark civilian nuclear trade deal with india which gives the asian giant the green light to buy nuclear fuel and technology on the global market . german foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said this week germany - as chair of the 45-nation nuclear suppliers group , which controls the export and sale of nuclear technology - had tried to balance conflicting interests during tense negotiations that led to the landmark agreement .
" there were several countries that put critical questions to india , but also the united states , about how this arrangement is compatible with the common goal of nuclear non-proliferation , " ploetner told a news conference on monday , sept 8 .
" it is not an ideal solution .
the negotiations were very difficult and we can not say that we could not have imagined something better . "
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- is a group of 45 states that control the international sale of nuclear technology .
the deal with india is a key step in sealing the india-us atomic technology accord signed by us president george w. bush and indian premier manmohan singh in 2005 .
the us-india business council , one of the champions of the pact between new delhi and washington , said the nsg 's decision could unlock nuclear energy investment in india worth more than $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- .
the controversial agreement , signed on saturday , sept .
6 , means germany and other states can start jostling for a strong position in the race to sell nuclear know-how and technology to india .
a controversial decision the us had been hoping for a quick decision on the embargo , so that the current us congress could ratify the accord before elections in november .
us lawmakers are pushing for a vote by the end of september .
the decision to lift the embargo was controversial , in part because india - which was embargoed in the first place after it developed and tested nuclear weapons test in 1974 - has so far refused to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and singh signed a nukes deal in 2005 the us exerted the most pressure on the nsg to lift the embargo .
it argues that cooperation in the civilian nuclear sector could bring india closer to signing on to the international nuclear non proliferation treaty , and that an increase in atomic energy sources will help in the fight against global warming .
but critics - such as austria , ireland and new zealand , supported by china - warned that india is being rewarded for its long-time insistence on a right to nuclear technology ; they fear india could use atomic technology for military ends .
moreover , the nsg stance undermines its negotiating power when it comes to dealing with states such as iran and pakistan , opponents argue .
germany shows grudging acceptance the last nsg member state to finally agree to lift the india embargo was austria .
it signed only after india formally decreed it would adhere to a moratorium on further atomic-bomb tests .
germany , which currently chairs the nsg , expressed grudging acceptance of the landmark atomic energy deal .
it , too , denied the accord undermines the west 's efforts to convince iran to stop sensitive nuclear work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's ahmadinejad wants to expand his program asked whether the pact contradicted the west 's united opposition to iran 's controversial nuclear program , ploetner told afp news service that the nuclear suppliers group had underscored the goal of non-proliferation with the agreement .
germany : iaea approval was key " does this agreement send an approving message to iran ?
no , it absolutely does not , " ploetner said , calling india a " special case . "
ploetner added that the approval of the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , the vienna-based international atomic energy agency , had been decisive in winning approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting the iaea to sign on was a key part of the deal germany is among six countries working to convince tehran to abandon uranium enrichment , which the west fears is a pretense for building an iranian nuclear weapon .
iran says its nuclear program is for civilian purposes only .
jostling for contracts has begun meanwhile , the us forecasts that india 's growing energy needs mean it will have to build at least eight new atomic energy plants by 2012 .
britain , france and russia have already joined the us in jostling for lucrative contracts .
and during the celebration of the 50th anniversary of a german-supported technical university earlier this week in chennai , india , german technology minister annette schavan was warmly greeted by her indian counterpart kipal sibal .
" we have to see the next 50 years of cooperation in the light of the events of this past weekend , " sibal said at the celebration .
in cooperation with germany , india could find out " which components and what know-how is important for us , " he added bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has a strong footing in atomic energy while the nsg decision means india is now technically free to trade on the world market , indian leaders said late monday , sept .

" there were several countries that put critical questions to india , but also the united states , about how this arrangement is compatible with the common goal of nuclear non-proliferation , " ploetner told a news conference on monday , sept 8 .
" it is not an ideal solution .
the negotiations were very difficult and we can not say that we could not have imagined something better . "
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- is a group of 45 states that control the international sale of nuclear technology .
the deal with india is a key step in sealing the india-us atomic technology accord signed by us president george w. bush and indian premier manmohan singh in 2005 .
the us-india business council , one of the champions of the pact between new delhi and washington , said the nsg 's decision could unlock nuclear energy investment in india worth more than $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- .
the controversial agreement , signed on saturday , sept .
6 , means germany and other states can start jostling for a strong position in the race to sell nuclear know-how and technology to india .
a controversial decision the us had been hoping for a quick decision on the embargo , so that the current us congress could ratify the accord before elections in november .
us lawmakers are pushing for a vote by the end of september .
the decision to lift the embargo was controversial , in part because india - which was embargoed in the first place after it developed and tested nuclear weapons test in 1974 - has so far refused to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and singh signed a nukes deal in 2005 the us exerted the most pressure on the nsg to lift the embargo .
it argues that cooperation in the civilian nuclear sector could bring india closer to signing on to the international nuclear non proliferation treaty , and that an increase in atomic energy sources will help in the fight against global warming .
but critics - such as austria , ireland and new zealand , supported by china - warned that india is being rewarded for its long-time insistence on a right to nuclear technology ; they fear india could use atomic technology for military ends .
moreover , the nsg stance undermines its negotiating power when it comes to dealing with states such as iran and pakistan , opponents argue .
germany shows grudging acceptance the last nsg member state to finally agree to lift the india embargo was austria .
it signed only after india formally decreed it would adhere to a moratorium on further atomic-bomb tests .
germany , which currently chairs the nsg , expressed grudging acceptance of the landmark atomic energy deal .
it , too , denied the accord undermines the west 's efforts to convince iran to stop sensitive nuclear work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's ahmadinejad wants to expand his program asked whether the pact contradicted the west 's united opposition to iran 's controversial nuclear program , ploetner told afp news service that the nuclear suppliers group had underscored the goal of non-proliferation with the agreement .
germany : iaea approval was key " does this agreement send an approving message to iran ?
no , it absolutely does not , " ploetner said , calling india a " special case . "
ploetner added that the approval of the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , the vienna-based international atomic energy agency , had been decisive in winning approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting the iaea to sign on was a key part of the deal germany is among six countries working to convince tehran to abandon uranium enrichment , which the west fears is a pretense for building an iranian nuclear weapon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 09.09.2008 eu to offer cautious support for ukraine 's candidacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paris summit is not set to mark a rite of passage for kiev the european union is expected to offer ukraine encouragement about closer ties but will stop short of making any firm commitments on future membership at a summit in paris on tuesday . in the light of the crisis between russia and georgia in the caucasus and fears of a resurgent russia , ukraine has no option but to join the european union eventually , and the bloc should say so to help the country 's leaders continue long-term reforms , kiev 's ambassador to moscow said monday .
" we are a european country , our place is in europe , " konstyantyn gryshchenko said in brussels , on the eve of an eu-ukraine summit in paris on tuesday , sept 9 .
ukraine president viktor yushchenko and his foreign minister are due to attend the summit along with president nicolas sarkozy of france , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
kiev 's goal is to become a fully-fledged member of the european union .
before that can happen it must be named an official candidate nation .
but officially at least , the eu sees the country 's political instability as a major sticking-point , as chief foreign policy envoy javier solana made evident in the run-up to the summit in paris , its new location after a last minute change of plans on monday .
" bilateral relations between ukraine and the eu are going in the right direction .
the ukrainian economy is developing well , there is growth , the inflation rate is gradually coming under control .
but we also have our reservations as far as the political situation is concerned .
this needs to stabilize .
parliamentary life has to normalize . "
last week saw the collapse of a shaky coalition between president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , reinforcing the eu 's misgivings about the country 's political situation .
member states also face waning public support for the expansion of the bloc .
fear of antagonizing russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is concerned about political instability in ukraine but ukraine expert amanda akcakoca from the european policy centre , a brussels think-tank , believes that concern about further straining ties with russia is primarily staying the eu 's hand .
" the eu can find a million pretexts , but i think the fear of russia is the main reason .
giving ukraine the prospect of joining the eu , bringing the country closer to the west , does not exactly endear it to moscow .
and that , of course , triggers certain qualms in some eu countries , " she told dw-radio .
at the summit , the eu side is likely to offer to conclude an " association agreement " with ukraine .
a draft declaration prepared by brussels-based diplomats ahead of the eu-ukraine summit says that this would leave open the possibility of further developments between the two sides .
the leaders are also set to announce the launch of a dialogue aimed at eventually achieving a visa-free regime between eu and ukraine . tale of two camps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is a key energy transit route up to now , poland , the czech republic , the nordic states , britain and the baltic states have been broadly positive about embracing ukraine , while germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria have been reluctant to do so .
one sensitive issue is migration .
the benelux countries and spain are fearful of receiving higher numbers of ukrainian workers .
but worries about threatening energy supplies from russia also play a role .
tomas valasek , from the london-based think-tank centre for european reform , told reuters news agency that the european union needed to send a clearer message to ukraine .
he described ukraine as the eu 's most important neighbor given its size , location and its power to influence other countries strategically important in terms of ensuring the security of the eu 's future energy supplies .
" if it can successfully europeanize ... it will clearly demonstrate to the central asian republics , to azerbaijan and to moldova and others that it 's possible to be a former soviet republic and a modern western country , " he said .

" we are a european country , our place is in europe , " konstyantyn gryshchenko said in brussels , on the eve of an eu-ukraine summit in paris on tuesday , sept 9 .
ukraine president viktor yushchenko and his foreign minister are due to attend the summit along with president nicolas sarkozy of france , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
kiev 's goal is to become a fully-fledged member of the european union .
before that can happen it must be named an official candidate nation .
but officially at least , the eu sees the country 's political instability as a major sticking-point , as chief foreign policy envoy javier solana made evident in the run-up to the summit in paris , its new location after a last minute change of plans on monday .
" bilateral relations between ukraine and the eu are going in the right direction .
the ukrainian economy is developing well , there is growth , the inflation rate is gradually coming under control .
but we also have our reservations as far as the political situation is concerned .
this needs to stabilize .
parliamentary life has to normalize . "
last week saw the collapse of a shaky coalition between president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , reinforcing the eu 's misgivings about the country 's political situation .
member states also face waning public support for the expansion of the bloc .
fear of antagonizing russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is concerned about political instability in ukraine but ukraine expert amanda akcakoca from the european policy centre , a brussels think-tank , believes that concern about further straining ties with russia is primarily staying the eu 's hand .
" the eu can find a million pretexts , but i think the fear of russia is the main reason .
giving ukraine the prospect of joining the eu , bringing the country closer to the west , does not exactly endear it to moscow .
and that , of course , triggers certain qualms in some eu countries , " she told dw-radio .
at the summit , the eu side is likely to offer to conclude an " association agreement " with ukraine .
a draft declaration prepared by brussels-based diplomats ahead of the eu-ukraine summit says that this would leave open the possibility of further developments between the two sides .
the leaders are also set to announce the launch of a dialogue aimed at eventually achieving a visa-free regime between eu and ukraine . tale of two camps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is a key energy transit route up to now , poland , the czech republic , the nordic states , britain and the baltic states have been broadly positive about embracing ukraine , while germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria have been reluctant to do so .
one sensitive issue is migration .
the benelux countries and spain are fearful of receiving higher numbers of ukrainian workers .
but worries about threatening energy supplies from russia also play a role .
tomas valasek , from the london-based think-tank centre for european reform , told reuters news agency that the european union needed to send a clearer message to ukraine .
he described ukraine as the eu 's most important neighbor given its size , location and its power to influence other countries strategically important in terms of ensuring the security of the eu 's future energy supplies .
" if it can successfully europeanize ... it will clearly demonstrate to the central asian republics , to azerbaijan and to moldova and others that it 's possible to be a former soviet republic and a modern western country , " he said .
" it will show that there is nothing inevitable about former soviet republics always being in the russian orbit .
that 's why it 's important for the eu to get it right . "
akcakoca , of the european policy center , also believes ukrainian accession would be of benefit to the eu .

" there were several countries that put critical questions to india , but also the united states , about how this arrangement is compatible with the common goal of nuclear non-proliferation , " ploetner told a news conference on monday , sept 8 .
" it is not an ideal solution .
the negotiations were very difficult and we can not say that we could not have imagined something better . "
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- is a group of 45 states that control the international sale of nuclear technology .
the deal with india is a key step in sealing the india-us atomic technology accord signed by us president george w. bush and indian premier manmohan singh in 2005 .
the us-india business council , one of the champions of the pact between new delhi and washington , said the nsg 's decision could unlock nuclear energy investment in india worth more than $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- .
the controversial agreement , signed on saturday , sept .
6 , means germany and other states can start jostling for a strong position in the race to sell nuclear know-how and technology to india .
a controversial decision the us had been hoping for a quick decision on the embargo , so that the current us congress could ratify the accord before elections in november .
us lawmakers are pushing for a vote by the end of september .
the decision to lift the embargo was controversial , in part because india - which was embargoed in the first place after it developed and tested nuclear weapons test in 1974 - has so far refused to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and singh signed a nukes deal in 2005 the us exerted the most pressure on the nsg to lift the embargo .
it argues that cooperation in the civilian nuclear sector could bring india closer to signing on to the international nuclear non proliferation treaty , and that an increase in atomic energy sources will help in the fight against global warming .
but critics - such as austria , ireland and new zealand , supported by china - warned that india is being rewarded for its long-time insistence on a right to nuclear technology ; they fear india could use atomic technology for military ends .
moreover , the nsg stance undermines its negotiating power when it comes to dealing with states such as iran and pakistan , opponents argue .
germany shows grudging acceptance the last nsg member state to finally agree to lift the india embargo was austria .
it signed only after india formally decreed it would adhere to a moratorium on further atomic-bomb tests .
germany , which currently chairs the nsg , expressed grudging acceptance of the landmark atomic energy deal .
it , too , denied the accord undermines the west 's efforts to convince iran to stop sensitive nuclear work .

germany : iaea approval was key " does this agreement send an approving message to iran ?
no , it absolutely does not , " ploetner said , calling india a " special case . "
ploetner added that the approval of the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , the vienna-based international atomic energy agency , had been decisive in winning approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting the iaea to sign on was a key part of the deal germany is among six countries working to convince tehran to abandon uranium enrichment , which the west fears is a pretense for building an iranian nuclear weapon .
iran says its nuclear program is for civilian purposes only .
jostling for contracts has begun meanwhile , the us forecasts that india 's growing energy needs mean it will have to build at least eight new atomic energy plants by 2012 .
britain , france and russia have already joined the us in jostling for lucrative contracts .

security experts are concerned the chrome browser uses a number for each user that is set up during installation and then communicated to a central server every time the product is in use for the purpose of collecting usage statistics such as details of program crashes .
critics are concerned that the number could be used to identify users .
google rejects security concerns but kay oberbeck , speaking for google , told the dpa news agency : " there are no connections made between the installation number and the entries in the search box or address box . "

another concern about the product is that it collects data from users for use in functions such as the " omnibox " which remembers the topics of previous searches and suggests possible search topics .
google confirms that it saves two percent of data , including users ip addresses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 09.09.2008 eu to offer cautious support for ukraine 's candidacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paris summit is not set to mark a rite of passage for kiev the european union is expected to offer ukraine encouragement about closer ties but will stop short of making any firm commitments on future membership at a summit in paris on tuesday . in the light of the crisis between russia and georgia in the caucasus and fears of a resurgent russia , ukraine has no option but to join the european union eventually , and the bloc should say so to help the country 's leaders continue long-term reforms , kiev 's ambassador to moscow said monday .
" we are a european country , our place is in europe , " konstyantyn gryshchenko said in brussels , on the eve of an eu-ukraine summit in paris on tuesday , sept 9 .
ukraine president viktor yushchenko and his foreign minister are due to attend the summit along with president nicolas sarkozy of france , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
kiev 's goal is to become a fully-fledged member of the european union .
before that can happen it must be named an official candidate nation .
but officially at least , the eu sees the country 's political instability as a major sticking-point , as chief foreign policy envoy javier solana made evident in the run-up to the summit in paris , its new location after a last minute change of plans on monday .
" bilateral relations between ukraine and the eu are going in the right direction .
the ukrainian economy is developing well , there is growth , the inflation rate is gradually coming under control .
but we also have our reservations as far as the political situation is concerned .
this needs to stabilize .
parliamentary life has to normalize . "
last week saw the collapse of a shaky coalition between president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , reinforcing the eu 's misgivings about the country 's political situation .
member states also face waning public support for the expansion of the bloc .
fear of antagonizing russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is concerned about political instability in ukraine but ukraine expert amanda akcakoca from the european policy centre , a brussels think-tank , believes that concern about further straining ties with russia is primarily staying the eu 's hand .
" the eu can find a million pretexts , but i think the fear of russia is the main reason .
giving ukraine the prospect of joining the eu , bringing the country closer to the west , does not exactly endear it to moscow .
and that , of course , triggers certain qualms in some eu countries , " she told dw-radio .
at the summit , the eu side is likely to offer to conclude an " association agreement " with ukraine .
a draft declaration prepared by brussels-based diplomats ahead of the eu-ukraine summit says that this would leave open the possibility of further developments between the two sides .
the leaders are also set to announce the launch of a dialogue aimed at eventually achieving a visa-free regime between eu and ukraine . tale of two camps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is a key energy transit route up to now , poland , the czech republic , the nordic states , britain and the baltic states have been broadly positive about embracing ukraine , while germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria have been reluctant to do so .
one sensitive issue is migration .
the benelux countries and spain are fearful of receiving higher numbers of ukrainian workers .
but worries about threatening energy supplies from russia also play a role .
tomas valasek , from the london-based think-tank centre for european reform , told reuters news agency that the european union needed to send a clearer message to ukraine .
he described ukraine as the eu 's most important neighbor given its size , location and its power to influence other countries strategically important in terms of ensuring the security of the eu 's future energy supplies .
" if it can successfully europeanize ... it will clearly demonstrate to the central asian republics , to azerbaijan and to moldova and others that it 's possible to be a former soviet republic and a modern western country , " he said .
" it will show that there is nothing inevitable about former soviet republics always being in the russian orbit .
that 's why it 's important for the eu to get it right . "
akcakoca , of the european policy center , also believes ukrainian accession would be of benefit to the eu .
" it will improve security at the eu 's external borders .
ukraine has a very dynamic economy , a modern army .
ukraine has already taken part in manoeuvres within the auspices of eu security and defense policy on a number of occasions .
i think that up to now the eu has profited more from ukraine than vice versa , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

security experts are concerned the chrome browser uses a number for each user that is set up during installation and then communicated to a central server every time the product is in use for the purpose of collecting usage statistics such as details of program crashes .
critics are concerned that the number could be used to identify users .

another concern about the product is that it collects data from users for use in functions such as the " omnibox " which remembers the topics of previous searches and suggests possible search topics .
google confirms that it saves two percent of data , including users ip addresses .
" this data is necessary to generate the completed search suggestions , " oberbeck explained .
oberbeck also stressed that user information is gathered in a way that makes the users anonymous , and he said that the function can be turned off simply .
critics have also said that , in releasing a test version of the product , google has given users a false sense of security .
" google should have clearly told its users that this is a beta version meant for testing , " daniel bachfeld of the german " c 't " computer magazine told dpa news agency .

the funding boost comes amid a surge of violence in the relatively quiet northern regions of afghanistan .

the german armed forces federation disagrees with that assessment .
following the death of a young german paratrooper at the end of august and the first civilian casualties at the hands of german soldiers a few days later , the federation 's chairman colonel bernhard gertz told reporters that the mission in afghanistan was nothing other than a " war against a fanatical enemy willing to do anything " .

following the death of a young german paratrooper at the end of august and the first civilian casualties at the hands of german soldiers a few days later , the federation 's chairman colonel bernhard gertz told reporters that the mission in afghanistan was nothing other than a " war against a fanatical enemy willing to do anything " .

" we will need to wait , not for very long , for a new administration to be established and at that point we need to reveal our strategy , not only a us strategy but the overall strategy , because clearly what we are doing so far is not going to lead to success , " vandrell said . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with violent attacks also on the rise , some question whether the country is ready for reconstruction - or still in a state of war . the plans would increase german aid to afghanistan from 140 million to 170 euros -lrb- $ 198-240 million -rrb- .
the funding boost comes amid a surge of violence in the relatively quiet northern regions of afghanistan .
the german government hopes more aid money will make those areas more secure .
" we have to give the -lsb- reconstruction -rsb- process in afghanistan a recognizable face , " german defense minister franz josef jung said at an international security conference in berlin on tuesday , sept 8 .

the german armed forces federation disagrees with that assessment .
following the death of a young german paratrooper at the end of august and the first civilian casualties at the hands of german soldiers a few days later , the federation 's chairman colonel bernhard gertz told reporters that the mission in afghanistan was nothing other than a " war against a fanatical enemy willing to do anything " .

" we will need to wait , not for very long , for a new administration to be established and at that point we need to reveal our strategy , not only a us strategy but the overall strategy , because clearly what we are doing so far is not going to lead to success , " vandrell said . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the week after the first break is traditionally when fans begin to get angry and coaches lose their jobs . the first few weeks of the season are like the initial ninety days of a new head of state 's term of office .
voters - or in the case of soccer , supporters - are willing to overlook fumbles and bumbles as part of the settling-in process .
but once the league emerges from its first break , club management and fans expect results .
and that puts serious pressure on the clubs who 've yet to chalk up a win .
hanover , in particular , will be feeling the heat .
touted by many observers in the pre-season as a possible top-five squad , they failed to score a goal in their first three matches and currently occupy the bottom spot in the table .
hanover coach dieter hecking has promised a turn-around this weekend against moenchengladbach .
but should he fail to get three points at home against a newly promoted opponent , his ears will be ringing with the one word all german coaches hate most - fehlstart .
more than just a bad beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus ' season has gotten off with a whimper fehlstart is , on the surface , just the german for bad beginning .
but in the culture of the bundesliga , it 's much more than that , something approaching an existential state of awfulness that can only be remedied with personnel changes .
and since the transfer window is closed , the only big move a club can make is firing the coach .
bojan prasnikar knows the score .
last september , he took over at energie cottbus after the small eastern german club had earned only two points from its first seven games .
now , he 's the one who 's having to answer endless fehlstart questions from baying-for-blood reporters , as cottbus has also failed to score and are tied at the bottom on one point .
but it 's unlikely prasnikar will be able to reverse energie 's fortunes straight away .
he 's going up this weekend against one of the bundesliga 's heavy hitters - and a team that 's fighting a fehlstart of its own .
quo vadis , werder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's schaaf wishes he could turn back time it 's no surprise to find the likes of bochum and bielefeld near the bottom and heading toward another season of merely battling for survival .
but werder bremen 's form has been shocking .
the side that usually plays the bundesliga 's most attractive football is off to its worst start in nine years , earning only a pair of draws and dropping five points to mediocre opposition .
having been at bremen 's helm for a decade , thomas schaaf is probably unfireable unless the bottom totally drops out .
but if they fail to hammer cottbus , expect changes to the squad - with ageing captain frank baumann looking to be a prime candidate for replacement .
werder are five points adrift of a spot in the champions league .
there 's plenty of time left to close that gap , but a disappointing result against massive underdogs cottbus would have fans and management asking some unpleasant existential questions about whether this squad is still truly among the bundesliga 's elite . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the week after the first break is traditionally when fans begin to get angry and coaches lose their jobs . the first few weeks of the season are like the initial ninety days of a new head of state 's term of office .
voters - or in the case of soccer , supporters - are willing to overlook fumbles and bumbles as part of the settling-in process .
but once the league emerges from its first break , club management and fans expect results .
and that puts serious pressure on the clubs who 've yet to chalk up a win .
hanover , in particular , will be feeling the heat .
touted by many observers in the pre-season as a possible top-five squad , they failed to score a goal in their first three matches and currently occupy the bottom spot in the table .
hanover coach dieter hecking has promised a turn-around this weekend against moenchengladbach .
but should he fail to get three points at home against a newly promoted opponent , his ears will be ringing with the one word all german coaches hate most - fehlstart .
more than just a bad beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus ' season has gotten off with a whimper fehlstart is , on the surface , just the german for bad beginning .
but in the culture of the bundesliga , it 's much more than that , something approaching an existential state of awfulness that can only be remedied with personnel changes .
and since the transfer window is closed , the only big move a club can make is firing the coach .
bojan prasnikar knows the score .
last september , he took over at energie cottbus after the small eastern german club had earned only two points from its first seven games .
now , he 's the one who 's having to answer endless fehlstart questions from baying-for-blood reporters , as cottbus has also failed to score and are tied at the bottom on one point .
but it 's unlikely prasnikar will be able to reverse energie 's fortunes straight away .
he 's going up this weekend against one of the bundesliga 's heavy hitters - and a team that 's fighting a fehlstart of its own .
quo vadis , werder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's schaaf wishes he could turn back time it 's no surprise to find the likes of bochum and bielefeld near the bottom and heading toward another season of merely battling for survival .
but werder bremen 's form has been shocking .
the side that usually plays the bundesliga 's most attractive football is off to its worst start in nine years , earning only a pair of draws and dropping five points to mediocre opposition .
having been at bremen 's helm for a decade , thomas schaaf is probably unfireable unless the bottom totally drops out .
but if they fail to hammer cottbus , expect changes to the squad - with ageing captain frank baumann looking to be a prime candidate for replacement .
werder are five points adrift of a spot in the champions league .
there 's plenty of time left to close that gap , but a disappointing result against massive underdogs cottbus would have fans and management asking some unpleasant existential questions about whether this squad is still truly among the bundesliga 's elite . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

through the abandonment of the negotiations over a partnership and cooperation settlement between the eu and russia , a unanimous europe has made it clear that it does not seek partnership with russia at any price .
that is how the eu has succeeded in making russia give in without having to use rhetoric to heat up the dispute .
the europeans ' calm , mediating politics has thus brought them a small symbolic win .
moscow 's clever chess tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel russia 's acceptance was , however , a clever chess tactic by president medvedev , since , in withdrawing its troops from the buffer zones , russia actually does not lose much ground .
the withdrawal plays no part regarding military strategy : russian army units continue to secure the renegade regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
neither has russia lost out from a diplomatic or political perspective : russia continues to disregard the principle of georgia 's territorial integrity by its recognition of abkhazian and south ossetian independence .
russia 's agreement to europe 's demand of withdrawing troops from the buffer zone should therefore not be seen as a political turning point in the caucasus conflict .
it is much more a symbolic gesture to europe .
russia has also made the decision not to heat up the dispute with europe further - but no more than that .
on the same day as the withdrawal agreement , there were further signs that the conflict is simply moving into a second stage as georgia accused russia of ethnic cleansing at the international court in the hague .
conflict continues sarkozy 's visit is a long way from reaching a solution to the caucasus conflict .
the fundamental problem remains : russia has used georgian aggression against the separatist regime in south ossetia to recognize the independence of the pro-russian regions .
in doing so , moscow has violated the principle of the invulnerability of post-soviet territory borders - also legally - for the first time since the fall of the soviet union 17 years ago .
that does not just mean a dangerous situation for georgia , but a threatening development for peace on the eurasian continent .
that is why a caucasus stability pact is necessary - a pact which russia and the eu are hopefully drawing closer to with the arrangement to send over 200 eu observers to oversee the ceasefire .

through the abandonment of the negotiations over a partnership and cooperation settlement between the eu and russia , a unanimous europe has made it clear that it does not seek partnership with russia at any price .
that is how the eu has succeeded in making russia give in without having to use rhetoric to heat up the dispute .
the europeans ' calm , mediating politics has thus brought them a small symbolic win .
moscow 's clever chess tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel russia 's acceptance was , however , a clever chess tactic by president medvedev , since , in withdrawing its troops from the buffer zones , russia actually does not lose much ground .
the withdrawal plays no part regarding military strategy : russian army units continue to secure the renegade regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
neither has russia lost out from a diplomatic or political perspective : russia continues to disregard the principle of georgia 's territorial integrity by its recognition of abkhazian and south ossetian independence .
russia 's agreement to europe 's demand of withdrawing troops from the buffer zone should therefore not be seen as a political turning point in the caucasus conflict .
it is much more a symbolic gesture to europe .
russia has also made the decision not to heat up the dispute with europe further - but no more than that .
on the same day as the withdrawal agreement , there were further signs that the conflict is simply moving into a second stage as georgia accused russia of ethnic cleansing at the international court in the hague .
conflict continues sarkozy 's visit is a long way from reaching a solution to the caucasus conflict .
the fundamental problem remains : russia has used georgian aggression against the separatist regime in south ossetia to recognize the independence of the pro-russian regions .
in doing so , moscow has violated the principle of the invulnerability of post-soviet territory borders - also legally - for the first time since the fall of the soviet union 17 years ago .
that does not just mean a dangerous situation for georgia , but a threatening development for peace on the eurasian continent .
that is why a caucasus stability pact is necessary - a pact which russia and the eu are hopefully drawing closer to with the arrangement to send over 200 eu observers to oversee the ceasefire .

giving ukraine the prospect of joining the eu , bringing the country closer to the west , does not exactly endear it to moscow .
and that , of course , triggers certain qualms in some eu countries , " she told dw-radio .
at the summit , the eu side is likely to offer to conclude an " association agreement " with ukraine .
a draft declaration prepared by brussels-based diplomats ahead of the eu-ukraine summit says that this would leave open the possibility of further developments between the two sides .
the leaders are also set to announce the launch of a dialogue aimed at eventually achieving a visa-free regime between eu and ukraine . tale of two camps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is a key energy transit route up to now , poland , the czech republic , the nordic states , britain and the baltic states have been broadly positive about embracing ukraine , while germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria have been reluctant to do so .
one sensitive issue is migration .
the benelux countries and spain are fearful of receiving higher numbers of ukrainian workers .
but worries about threatening energy supplies from russia also play a role .
tomas valasek , from the london-based think-tank centre for european reform , told reuters news agency that the european union needed to send a clearer message to ukraine .
he described ukraine as the eu 's most important neighbor given its size , location and its power to influence other countries strategically important in terms of ensuring the security of the eu 's future energy supplies .
" if it can successfully europeanize ... it will clearly demonstrate to the central asian republics , to azerbaijan and to moldova and others that it 's possible to be a former soviet republic and a modern western country , " he said .
" it will show that there is nothing inevitable about former soviet republics always being in the russian orbit .
that 's why it 's important for the eu to get it right . "
akcakoca , of the european policy center , also believes ukrainian accession would be of benefit to the eu .
" it will improve security at the eu 's external borders .
ukraine has a very dynamic economy , a modern army .
ukraine has already taken part in manoeuvres within the auspices of eu security and defense policy on a number of occasions .
i think that up to now the eu has profited more from ukraine than vice versa , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the bloc did not mention concrete security guarantees or membership prospects . probably the most heartening words from the summit for ukrainian president viktor yushchenko came at the concluding press conference , when summit chairman and french president nicolas sarkozy said that , in the eyes of europe , ukrainian territorial integrity was " non-negotiable . "
the meeting between yushchenko and representatives form the eu 's 27 member states came in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict and amidst ukrainian worries about moscow 's motives .
in a joint statement , eu member states " recognized that ukraine , as a european country , shares a common history and common values with the countries of the eu . "
the " association agreement " that emerged form the summit offers kiev enhanced status in its dealings with the eu .
but it does not say anything about whether ukraine could possibly join the bloc some day .
indeed the agreement , as sarkozy stressed to the press , " neither opens nor closes any route . "
for his part , yushchenko told reporters he was convinced that his country and the eu would sign " a very symbolic document cementing relations . "
" the main thing is that today we qualified as a european country , " yushchenko added .
" this is the first step of this great road that all countries which then became eu members , walked on . "
european divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian-georgian conflict has everyone worried about eastern europe but if the post-summit tone was warm , the statements and the agreement emerging from the meeting reflected the fact that the eu is not at all of a single mind as to where it stands vis-à-vis ukraine and russia .
" there are differing positions within the european council , " sarkozy said .
" and we explained to president yushchenko that this was the maximum we could promise him . "
britain , poland and sweden have been pushing the bloc to deepen ties with kiev to offset pressure from moscow .
but member states like germany , italy and the benelux countries want the eu to be more cautious and take more account of russia 's interests in eastern europe .
there are even questions as to whether the people of ukraine , with its heavy russian-speaking population , would truly welcome a more hard-line course toward moscow . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the device is to be manufactured in germany . the as-yet-unnamed device is the size of a piece of standard printer paper and the screen allows users to annotate documents and will offer the option of embedding video .
the new invention was shown off at an industry event called demofall in san diego .
it is due to go on sale early next year and is expected to be embraced by newspaper publishers eager to cut the costs associated with printing and distributing paper editions .
the device uses technology from e-ink , the company that also powers electronic readers from sony and amazon .
but the screen of the plastic logic gadget is built with transistor arrays on flexible plastic surfaces that are lighter , stronger , less expensive and more environmentally friendly than the silicon-based systems in use until now .
the plastic reader is designed to store dozens or hundreds of business documents on a very thin digital reader .
it can store e-books , magazines , newspapers , pdf files and all kinds of information , the company said .
" even though we have positioned this for business documents , newspapers -lrb- are -rrb- what everyone asks for , " said richard archuleta , plastic logic 's ceo .

but the screen of the plastic logic gadget is built with transistor arrays on flexible plastic surfaces that are lighter , stronger , less expensive and more environmentally friendly than the silicon-based systems in use until now .
the plastic reader is designed to store dozens or hundreds of business documents on a very thin digital reader .
it can store e-books , magazines , newspapers , pdf files and all kinds of information , the company said .
" even though we have positioned this for business documents , newspapers -lrb- are -rrb- what everyone asks for , " said richard archuleta , plastic logic 's ceo .

but critics are n't convinced . swedish energy utility vattenfall sees carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- as a revolutionary answer to global warming which is largely blamed on carbon dioxide released when fossil fuels burn .
" this technology will become more important than offshore wind farms , " said vattenfall boss lars josefsson .
" our project at schwarze pumpe puts us at the forefront of this technology in the world , " said tuomo hatakka , the chief executive of vattenfall europe , referring to the the 70-million euro plant in eastern germany .
vattenfall , one of europe 's largest energy companies , hopes the project will help provide energy security through plentiful coal supplies while avoiding the co2 emissions that are blamed for global warming .
vattenfall underscores " clean technology " aspect a finnish-born executive who heads the swedish group 's berlin-based subsidiary , hatakka told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the process was viable because companies will have to buy eu allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ccs test plant has drawn prominent visitors including chancellor merkel " in tandem with eu-wide trading in emission rights , ccs will be economic .
at 30 to 35 euros per emission certificate , the technology breaks even , " he said .
the 30-megawatt pilot plant at schwarze pumpe in the lausitz region of eastern germany is very small compared to conventional power stations .
but it 's the first coal-fired power plant in the world ready to capture and store its own carbon dioxide emissions - a so-called ccs plant .
carbon dioxide emitted when lignite coal burns will not be vented up a chimney but piped away , compressed to a liquid and pumped into deep , porous rock .
the concentrated carbon dioxide will then be injected " for permanent storage " in a gas field in northern germany .
vattenfall plans to build two " demonstration plants " 10 times that size in germany and denmark by 2015 at the latest .
hatakka said the company aimed to commission its first " large-scale ccs power station " in 2020 .
the outcome of this new plant will be heat , water vapor , nine tons of co2 per hour and a milestone in clean energy technology , according to markus füller , a spokesman for vattenfall .
“ this process is necessary if we ever hope to continue using soft , lignite coal , he says .
we need to get a handle on the co2 problem , and we think this technology is the way to do it , " füller said .
critics are n't convinced but environmentalists say the technology uses far more energy than existing power generation and warn that there are no secure long-term storage facilities for the gas .
german conservation group bund on monday denounced the project as simply a cover allowing vattenfall to expand its network of conventional coal-fired power stations in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say the focus should be on expanding cheaper renewable energy rather than on polluting coal thorben becker of bund said it was still uncertain if ccs worked on a large scale .
ccs power stations would obtain 10 per cent less power from the coal than conventional plants did , and it was not clear if there were enough suitable sites to dump the co2 .
" instead of concentrating on far cheaper renewable energy , vattenfall is locking itself in for decades to converting climate-damaging brown coal into electricity , " he said .
the european union wants to have 10 or 12 full-scale ccs power stations within the next few years , but it is not clear who will pay the high costs of building and running the plants . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our project at schwarze pumpe puts us at the forefront of this technology in the world , " said tuomo hatakka , the chief executive of vattenfall europe , referring to the the 70-million euro plant in eastern germany .
vattenfall , one of europe 's largest energy companies , hopes the project will help provide energy security through plentiful coal supplies while avoiding the co2 emissions that are blamed for global warming .
vattenfall underscores " clean technology " aspect a finnish-born executive who heads the swedish group 's berlin-based subsidiary , hatakka told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the process was viable because companies will have to buy eu allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ccs test plant has drawn prominent visitors including chancellor merkel " in tandem with eu-wide trading in emission rights , ccs will be economic .
at 30 to 35 euros per emission certificate , the technology breaks even , " he said .
the 30-megawatt pilot plant at schwarze pumpe in the lausitz region of eastern germany is very small compared to conventional power stations .
but it 's the first coal-fired power plant in the world ready to capture and store its own carbon dioxide emissions - a so-called ccs plant .
carbon dioxide emitted when lignite coal burns will not be vented up a chimney but piped away , compressed to a liquid and pumped into deep , porous rock .
the concentrated carbon dioxide will then be injected " for permanent storage " in a gas field in northern germany .
vattenfall plans to build two " demonstration plants " 10 times that size in germany and denmark by 2015 at the latest .
hatakka said the company aimed to commission its first " large-scale ccs power station " in 2020 .
the outcome of this new plant will be heat , water vapor , nine tons of co2 per hour and a milestone in clean energy technology , according to markus füller , a spokesman for vattenfall .
“ this process is necessary if we ever hope to continue using soft , lignite coal , he says .
we need to get a handle on the co2 problem , and we think this technology is the way to do it , " füller said .
critics are n't convinced but environmentalists say the technology uses far more energy than existing power generation and warn that there are no secure long-term storage facilities for the gas .
german conservation group bund on monday denounced the project as simply a cover allowing vattenfall to expand its network of conventional coal-fired power stations in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say the focus should be on expanding cheaper renewable energy rather than on polluting coal thorben becker of bund said it was still uncertain if ccs worked on a large scale .
ccs power stations would obtain 10 per cent less power from the coal than conventional plants did , and it was not clear if there were enough suitable sites to dump the co2 .
" instead of concentrating on far cheaper renewable energy , vattenfall is locking itself in for decades to converting climate-damaging brown coal into electricity , " he said .
the european union wants to have 10 or 12 full-scale ccs power stations within the next few years , but it is not clear who will pay the high costs of building and running the plants . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there were several countries that put critical questions to india , but also the united states , about how this arrangement is compatible with the common goal of nuclear non-proliferation , " ploetner told a news conference on monday , sept 8 .
" it is not an ideal solution .
the negotiations were very difficult and we can not say that we could not have imagined something better . "
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- is a group of 45 states that control the international sale of nuclear technology .
the deal with india is a key step in sealing the india-us atomic technology accord signed by us president george w. bush and indian premier manmohan singh in 2005 .
the us-india business council , one of the champions of the pact between new delhi and washington , said the nsg 's decision could unlock nuclear energy investment in india worth more than $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- .
the controversial agreement , signed on saturday , sept .
6 , means germany and other states can start jostling for a strong position in the race to sell nuclear know-how and technology to india .
a controversial decision the us had been hoping for a quick decision on the embargo , so that the current us congress could ratify the accord before elections in november .
us lawmakers are pushing for a vote by the end of september .
the decision to lift the embargo was controversial , in part because india - which was embargoed in the first place after it developed and tested nuclear weapons test in 1974 - has so far refused to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and singh signed a nukes deal in 2005 the us exerted the most pressure on the nsg to lift the embargo .
it argues that cooperation in the civilian nuclear sector could bring india closer to signing on to the international nuclear non proliferation treaty , and that an increase in atomic energy sources will help in the fight against global warming .
but critics - such as austria , ireland and new zealand , supported by china - warned that india is being rewarded for its long-time insistence on a right to nuclear technology ; they fear india could use atomic technology for military ends .
moreover , the nsg stance undermines its negotiating power when it comes to dealing with states such as iran and pakistan , opponents argue .
germany shows grudging acceptance the last nsg member state to finally agree to lift the india embargo was austria .
it signed only after india formally decreed it would adhere to a moratorium on further atomic-bomb tests .
germany , which currently chairs the nsg , expressed grudging acceptance of the landmark atomic energy deal .
it , too , denied the accord undermines the west 's efforts to convince iran to stop sensitive nuclear work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's ahmadinejad wants to expand his program asked whether the pact contradicted the west 's united opposition to iran 's controversial nuclear program , ploetner told afp news service that the nuclear suppliers group had underscored the goal of non-proliferation with the agreement .
germany : iaea approval was key " does this agreement send an approving message to iran ?
no , it absolutely does not , " ploetner said , calling india a " special case . "
ploetner added that the approval of the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , the vienna-based international atomic energy agency , had been decisive in winning approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting the iaea to sign on was a key part of the deal germany is among six countries working to convince tehran to abandon uranium enrichment , which the west fears is a pretense for building an iranian nuclear weapon .
iran says its nuclear program is for civilian purposes only .
jostling for contracts has begun meanwhile , the us forecasts that india 's growing energy needs mean it will have to build at least eight new atomic energy plants by 2012 .
britain , france and russia have already joined the us in jostling for lucrative contracts .
and during the celebration of the 50th anniversary of a german-supported technical university earlier this week in chennai , india , german technology minister annette schavan was warmly greeted by her indian counterpart kipal sibal .

the deal with india is a key step in sealing the india-us atomic technology accord signed by us president george w. bush and indian premier manmohan singh in 2005 .

a berlin newspaper quoted a spokesman for the federal office of information matthias gaertner at the weekend saying that the chrome browser " should not be used for general use . "
since then there have been reports that the federal office for information security has issued an official warning against using the new google browser .
but on monday sep .
8 gaertner told the ap news agency that his comments had been taken out of context .
security experts are concerned the chrome browser uses a number for each user that is set up during installation and then communicated to a central server every time the product is in use for the purpose of collecting usage statistics such as details of program crashes .
critics are concerned that the number could be used to identify users .
google rejects security concerns but kay oberbeck , speaking for google , told the dpa news agency : " there are no connections made between the installation number and the entries in the search box or address box . "
the system of attributing a number to each user is not particular to this new google product .
mozilla , the browser of the non-commercial firefox brand , also sends a user number the software company 's server .
another concern about the product is that it collects data from users for use in functions such as the " omnibox " which remembers the topics of previous searches and suggests possible search topics .
google confirms that it saves two percent of data , including users ip addresses .
" this data is necessary to generate the completed search suggestions , " oberbeck explained .
oberbeck also stressed that user information is gathered in a way that makes the users anonymous , and he said that the function can be turned off simply .
critics have also said that , in releasing a test version of the product , google has given users a false sense of security .
" google should have clearly told its users that this is a beta version meant for testing , " daniel bachfeld of the german " c 't " computer magazine told dpa news agency .
spokesman for google germany stefan keuchel said that the beta version was released because it allows for more flexibility in finding bugs , fixing glitches and addressing feedback from users . dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a berlin newspaper quoted a spokesman for the federal office of information matthias gaertner at the weekend saying that the chrome browser " should not be used for general use . "
since then there have been reports that the federal office for information security has issued an official warning against using the new google browser .
but on monday sep .
8 gaertner told the ap news agency that his comments had been taken out of context .
security experts are concerned the chrome browser uses a number for each user that is set up during installation and then communicated to a central server every time the product is in use for the purpose of collecting usage statistics such as details of program crashes .
critics are concerned that the number could be used to identify users .
google rejects security concerns but kay oberbeck , speaking for google , told the dpa news agency : " there are no connections made between the installation number and the entries in the search box or address box . "
the system of attributing a number to each user is not particular to this new google product .
mozilla , the browser of the non-commercial firefox brand , also sends a user number the software company 's server .
another concern about the product is that it collects data from users for use in functions such as the " omnibox " which remembers the topics of previous searches and suggests possible search topics .
google confirms that it saves two percent of data , including users ip addresses .
" this data is necessary to generate the completed search suggestions , " oberbeck explained .
oberbeck also stressed that user information is gathered in a way that makes the users anonymous , and he said that the function can be turned off simply .
critics have also said that , in releasing a test version of the product , google has given users a false sense of security .
" google should have clearly told its users that this is a beta version meant for testing , " daniel bachfeld of the german " c 't " computer magazine told dpa news agency .

is this a case of a state guarding a company against free competition ? the eu is set to try to end a long-running dispute over whether a german law giving the state of lower saxony veto powers in vw 's affairs is in violation of the block competition rules .
the eu has been trying to get germany 's federal government to scrap or revise the so-called " vw law " - which privileges lower saxony despite that state possessing less than the 25 percent of shares normally required for a veto - since 2004 .
the european court of justice ruled the 48-year-old law invalid last october .
it was subsequently revised , but not enough to satisfy the bloc .
" the facts are clear - they 're not changing their positions , " said a spokesman for eu internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy in a statement .
eu legal action would begin " as soon as possible , " added the spokesman .
porsche to benefit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw is one of germany 's most recognizable brands officials for lower saxony in the city of hanover had no comment on the proposed legal action , other than to say that mccreedy 's position was known .
the vw law was enacted in 1960 to allow the state government to protect germany 's largest carmaker from foreign takeover .
but it has come under increasing criticism in recent years , especially from porsche .
despite being smaller than the vw , the profitable , luxury-oriented company would like to take over the giant carmaker .
" this is completely in line with our thinking , " said a spokesman for porsche , which holds over 30 percent of voting rights in vw .
" we are firmly convinced there 's no need for a vw law . "
germany 's economic minister michael glos has also said he believes that the vw law is unnecessary and that the blocking clause favoring lower saxony could be removed .
unions representing vw workers , however , have been vocal in their support for the law , saying it protected the interests of employees . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the funding boost comes amid a surge of violence in the relatively quiet northern regions of afghanistan .
the german government hopes more aid money will make those areas more secure .
" we have to give the -lsb- reconstruction -rsb- process in afghanistan a recognizable face , " german defense minister franz josef jung said at an international security conference in berlin on tuesday , sept 8 .

the german armed forces federation disagrees with that assessment .
following the death of a young german paratrooper at the end of august and the first civilian casualties at the hands of german soldiers a few days later , the federation 's chairman colonel bernhard gertz told reporters that the mission in afghanistan was nothing other than a " war against a fanatical enemy willing to do anything " .

the former eu envoy to afghanistan on tuesday slammed nato and us-led operations in the country , saying there is no coherent strategy and progress is unlikely while george w. bush remains us president . in a bbc interview to be aired tuesday , francesc vendrell lamented that " so many mistakes " were made after the us-led invasion in 2001 and warned that mounting civilian casualties were undermining support for the coalition . vandrell said the west had no coherent strategy for victory in afghanistan , adding the bush adminstration did not want to make any changes because they want to present the country as a success story . " we will need to wait , not for very long , for a new administration to be established and at that point we need to reveal our strategy , not only a us strategy but the overall strategy , because clearly what we are doing so far is not going to lead to success , " vandrell said . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is this a case of a state guarding a company against free competition ? the eu is set to try to end a long-running dispute over whether a german law giving the state of lower saxony veto powers in vw 's affairs is in violation of the block competition rules .
the eu has been trying to get germany 's federal government to scrap or revise the so-called " vw law " - which privileges lower saxony despite that state possessing less than the 25 percent of shares normally required for a veto - since 2004 .
the european court of justice ruled the 48-year-old law invalid last october .
it was subsequently revised , but not enough to satisfy the bloc .
" the facts are clear - they 're not changing their positions , " said a spokesman for eu internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy in a statement .
eu legal action would begin " as soon as possible , " added the spokesman .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw is one of germany 's most recognizable brands officials for lower saxony in the city of hanover had no comment on the proposed legal action , other than to say that mccreedy 's position was known .
the vw law was enacted in 1960 to allow the state government to protect germany 's largest carmaker from foreign takeover .
but it has come under increasing criticism in recent years , especially from porsche .
despite being smaller than the vw , the profitable , luxury-oriented company would like to take over the giant carmaker .
" this is completely in line with our thinking , " said a spokesman for porsche , which holds over 30 percent of voting rights in vw .
" we are firmly convinced there 's no need for a vw law . "
germany 's economic minister michael glos has also said he believes that the vw law is unnecessary and that the blocking clause favoring lower saxony could be removed .
unions representing vw workers , however , have been vocal in their support for the law , saying it protected the interests of employees . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

through the abandonment of the negotiations over a partnership and cooperation settlement between the eu and russia , a unanimous europe has made it clear that it does not seek partnership with russia at any price .
that is how the eu has succeeded in making russia give in without having to use rhetoric to heat up the dispute .
the europeans ' calm , mediating politics has thus brought them a small symbolic win .
moscow 's clever chess tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel russia 's acceptance was , however , a clever chess tactic by president medvedev , since , in withdrawing its troops from the buffer zones , russia actually does not lose much ground .
the withdrawal plays no part regarding military strategy : russian army units continue to secure the renegade regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
neither has russia lost out from a diplomatic or political perspective : russia continues to disregard the principle of georgia 's territorial integrity by its recognition of abkhazian and south ossetian independence .
russia 's agreement to europe 's demand of withdrawing troops from the buffer zone should therefore not be seen as a political turning point in the caucasus conflict .
it is much more a symbolic gesture to europe .
russia has also made the decision not to heat up the dispute with europe further - but no more than that .
on the same day as the withdrawal agreement , there were further signs that the conflict is simply moving into a second stage as georgia accused russia of ethnic cleansing at the international court in the hague .
conflict continues sarkozy 's visit is a long way from reaching a solution to the caucasus conflict .
the fundamental problem remains : russia has used georgian aggression against the separatist regime in south ossetia to recognize the independence of the pro-russian regions .
in doing so , moscow has violated the principle of the invulnerability of post-soviet territory borders - also legally - for the first time since the fall of the soviet union 17 years ago .
that does not just mean a dangerous situation for georgia , but a threatening development for peace on the eurasian continent .
that is why a caucasus stability pact is necessary - a pact which russia and the eu are hopefully drawing closer to with the arrangement to send over 200 eu observers to oversee the ceasefire .

neither has russia lost out from a diplomatic or political perspective : russia continues to disregard the principle of georgia 's territorial integrity by its recognition of abkhazian and south ossetian independence .
russia 's agreement to europe 's demand of withdrawing troops from the buffer zone should therefore not be seen as a political turning point in the caucasus conflict .
it is much more a symbolic gesture to europe .
russia has also made the decision not to heat up the dispute with europe further - but no more than that .
on the same day as the withdrawal agreement , there were further signs that the conflict is simply moving into a second stage as georgia accused russia of ethnic cleansing at the international court in the hague .
conflict continues sarkozy 's visit is a long way from reaching a solution to the caucasus conflict .
the fundamental problem remains : russia has used georgian aggression against the separatist regime in south ossetia to recognize the independence of the pro-russian regions .
in doing so , moscow has violated the principle of the invulnerability of post-soviet territory borders - also legally - for the first time since the fall of the soviet union 17 years ago .
that does not just mean a dangerous situation for georgia , but a threatening development for peace on the eurasian continent .
that is why a caucasus stability pact is necessary - a pact which russia and the eu are hopefully drawing closer to with the arrangement to send over 200 eu observers to oversee the ceasefire .

through the abandonment of the negotiations over a partnership and cooperation settlement between the eu and russia , a unanimous europe has made it clear that it does not seek partnership with russia at any price .
that is how the eu has succeeded in making russia give in without having to use rhetoric to heat up the dispute .
the europeans ' calm , mediating politics has thus brought them a small symbolic win .

the week after the first break is traditionally when fans begin to get angry and coaches lose their jobs . the first few weeks of the season are like the initial ninety days of a new head of state 's term of office .
voters - or in the case of soccer , supporters - are willing to overlook fumbles and bumbles as part of the settling-in process .
but once the league emerges from its first break , club management and fans expect results .
and that puts serious pressure on the clubs who 've yet to chalk up a win .
hanover , in particular , will be feeling the heat .
touted by many observers in the pre-season as a possible top-five squad , they failed to score a goal in their first three matches and currently occupy the bottom spot in the table .
hanover coach dieter hecking has promised a turn-around this weekend against moenchengladbach .
but should he fail to get three points at home against a newly promoted opponent , his ears will be ringing with the one word all german coaches hate most - fehlstart .
more than just a bad beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus ' season has gotten off with a whimper fehlstart is , on the surface , just the german for bad beginning .
but in the culture of the bundesliga , it 's much more than that , something approaching an existential state of awfulness that can only be remedied with personnel changes .
and since the transfer window is closed , the only big move a club can make is firing the coach .
bojan prasnikar knows the score .
last september , he took over at energie cottbus after the small eastern german club had earned only two points from its first seven games .
now , he 's the one who 's having to answer endless fehlstart questions from baying-for-blood reporters , as cottbus has also failed to score and are tied at the bottom on one point .
but it 's unlikely prasnikar will be able to reverse energie 's fortunes straight away .
he 's going up this weekend against one of the bundesliga 's heavy hitters - and a team that 's fighting a fehlstart of its own .
quo vadis , werder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's schaaf wishes he could turn back time it 's no surprise to find the likes of bochum and bielefeld near the bottom and heading toward another season of merely battling for survival .
but werder bremen 's form has been shocking .
the side that usually plays the bundesliga 's most attractive football is off to its worst start in nine years , earning only a pair of draws and dropping five points to mediocre opposition .
having been at bremen 's helm for a decade , thomas schaaf is probably unfireable unless the bottom totally drops out .
but if they fail to hammer cottbus , expect changes to the squad - with ageing captain frank baumann looking to be a prime candidate for replacement .
werder are five points adrift of a spot in the champions league .

but should he fail to get three points at home against a newly promoted opponent , his ears will be ringing with the one word all german coaches hate most - fehlstart .
more than just a bad beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus ' season has gotten off with a whimper fehlstart is , on the surface , just the german for bad beginning .
but in the culture of the bundesliga , it 's much more than that , something approaching an existential state of awfulness that can only be remedied with personnel changes .
and since the transfer window is closed , the only big move a club can make is firing the coach .
bojan prasnikar knows the score .
last september , he took over at energie cottbus after the small eastern german club had earned only two points from its first seven games .
now , he 's the one who 's having to answer endless fehlstart questions from baying-for-blood reporters , as cottbus has also failed to score and are tied at the bottom on one point .
but it 's unlikely prasnikar will be able to reverse energie 's fortunes straight away .
he 's going up this weekend against one of the bundesliga 's heavy hitters - and a team that 's fighting a fehlstart of its own .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 09.09.2008 teams try to avoid dreaded bad start when season resumes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker mikael forssell is not yet a hanover helper many players are still with their national sides , but some bundesliga clubs are worrying about the season restart .
the week after the first break is traditionally when fans begin to get angry and coaches lose their jobs . the first few weeks of the season are like the initial ninety days of a new head of state 's term of office .
voters - or in the case of soccer , supporters - are willing to overlook fumbles and bumbles as part of the settling-in process .
but once the league emerges from its first break , club management and fans expect results .
and that puts serious pressure on the clubs who 've yet to chalk up a win .
hanover , in particular , will be feeling the heat .
touted by many observers in the pre-season as a possible top-five squad , they failed to score a goal in their first three matches and currently occupy the bottom spot in the table .
hanover coach dieter hecking has promised a turn-around this weekend against moenchengladbach .
but should he fail to get three points at home against a newly promoted opponent , his ears will be ringing with the one word all german coaches hate most - fehlstart .
more than just a bad beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus ' season has gotten off with a whimper fehlstart is , on the surface , just the german for bad beginning .
but in the culture of the bundesliga , it 's much more than that , something approaching an existential state of awfulness that can only be remedied with personnel changes .
and since the transfer window is closed , the only big move a club can make is firing the coach .
bojan prasnikar knows the score .
last september , he took over at energie cottbus after the small eastern german club had earned only two points from its first seven games .
now , he 's the one who 's having to answer endless fehlstart questions from baying-for-blood reporters , as cottbus has also failed to score and are tied at the bottom on one point .
but it 's unlikely prasnikar will be able to reverse energie 's fortunes straight away .
he 's going up this weekend against one of the bundesliga 's heavy hitters - and a team that 's fighting a fehlstart of its own .
quo vadis , werder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's schaaf wishes he could turn back time it 's no surprise to find the likes of bochum and bielefeld near the bottom and heading toward another season of merely battling for survival .
but werder bremen 's form has been shocking .
the side that usually plays the bundesliga 's most attractive football is off to its worst start in nine years , earning only a pair of draws and dropping five points to mediocre opposition .
having been at bremen 's helm for a decade , thomas schaaf is probably unfireable unless the bottom totally drops out .
but if they fail to hammer cottbus , expect changes to the squad - with ageing captain frank baumann looking to be a prime candidate for replacement .
werder are five points adrift of a spot in the champions league .
there 's plenty of time left to close that gap , but a disappointing result against massive underdogs cottbus would have fans and management asking some unpleasant existential questions about whether this squad is still truly among the bundesliga 's elite . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 09.09.2008 carbon capture plant opens in germany amid reservations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant in eastern germany , near the polish border is the only one of its kind in the world energy giant vattenfall has launched an emissions-free coal-fired test plant near berlin using a technology touted as a huge potential breakthrough in the fight against global warming .
but critics are n't convinced . swedish energy utility vattenfall sees carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- as a revolutionary answer to global warming which is largely blamed on carbon dioxide released when fossil fuels burn .
" this technology will become more important than offshore wind farms , " said vattenfall boss lars josefsson .
" our project at schwarze pumpe puts us at the forefront of this technology in the world , " said tuomo hatakka , the chief executive of vattenfall europe , referring to the the 70-million euro plant in eastern germany .
vattenfall , one of europe 's largest energy companies , hopes the project will help provide energy security through plentiful coal supplies while avoiding the co2 emissions that are blamed for global warming .
vattenfall underscores " clean technology " aspect a finnish-born executive who heads the swedish group 's berlin-based subsidiary , hatakka told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the process was viable because companies will have to buy eu allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ccs test plant has drawn prominent visitors including chancellor merkel " in tandem with eu-wide trading in emission rights , ccs will be economic .
at 30 to 35 euros per emission certificate , the technology breaks even , " he said .
the 30-megawatt pilot plant at schwarze pumpe in the lausitz region of eastern germany is very small compared to conventional power stations .
but it 's the first coal-fired power plant in the world ready to capture and store its own carbon dioxide emissions - a so-called ccs plant .
carbon dioxide emitted when lignite coal burns will not be vented up a chimney but piped away , compressed to a liquid and pumped into deep , porous rock .
the concentrated carbon dioxide will then be injected " for permanent storage " in a gas field in northern germany .
vattenfall plans to build two " demonstration plants " 10 times that size in germany and denmark by 2015 at the latest .
hatakka said the company aimed to commission its first " large-scale ccs power station " in 2020 .
the outcome of this new plant will be heat , water vapor , nine tons of co2 per hour and a milestone in clean energy technology , according to markus füller , a spokesman for vattenfall .
“ this process is necessary if we ever hope to continue using soft , lignite coal , he says .
we need to get a handle on the co2 problem , and we think this technology is the way to do it , " füller said .
critics are n't convinced but environmentalists say the technology uses far more energy than existing power generation and warn that there are no secure long-term storage facilities for the gas .
german conservation group bund on monday denounced the project as simply a cover allowing vattenfall to expand its network of conventional coal-fired power stations in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say the focus should be on expanding cheaper renewable energy rather than on polluting coal thorben becker of bund said it was still uncertain if ccs worked on a large scale .
ccs power stations would obtain 10 per cent less power from the coal than conventional plants did , and it was not clear if there were enough suitable sites to dump the co2 .
" instead of concentrating on far cheaper renewable energy , vattenfall is locking itself in for decades to converting climate-damaging brown coal into electricity , " he said .
the european union wants to have 10 or 12 full-scale ccs power stations within the next few years , but it is not clear who will pay the high costs of building and running the plants . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the device is to be manufactured in germany . the as-yet-unnamed device is the size of a piece of standard printer paper and the screen allows users to annotate documents and will offer the option of embedding video .
the new invention was shown off at an industry event called demofall in san diego .
it is due to go on sale early next year and is expected to be embraced by newspaper publishers eager to cut the costs associated with printing and distributing paper editions .
the device uses technology from e-ink , the company that also powers electronic readers from sony and amazon .
but the screen of the plastic logic gadget is built with transistor arrays on flexible plastic surfaces that are lighter , stronger , less expensive and more environmentally friendly than the silicon-based systems in use until now .
the plastic reader is designed to store dozens or hundreds of business documents on a very thin digital reader .
it can store e-books , magazines , newspapers , pdf files and all kinds of information , the company said .
" even though we have positioned this for business documents , newspapers -lrb- are -rrb- what everyone asks for , " said richard archuleta , plastic logic 's ceo .

the device is to be manufactured in germany . the as-yet-unnamed device is the size of a piece of standard printer paper and the screen allows users to annotate documents and will offer the option of embedding video .
the new invention was shown off at an industry event called demofall in san diego .
it is due to go on sale early next year and is expected to be embraced by newspaper publishers eager to cut the costs associated with printing and distributing paper editions .
the device uses technology from e-ink , the company that also powers electronic readers from sony and amazon .
but the screen of the plastic logic gadget is built with transistor arrays on flexible plastic surfaces that are lighter , stronger , less expensive and more environmentally friendly than the silicon-based systems in use until now .
the plastic reader is designed to store dozens or hundreds of business documents on a very thin digital reader .

is this a case of a state guarding a company against free competition ? the eu is set to try to end a long-running dispute over whether a german law giving the state of lower saxony veto powers in vw 's affairs is in violation of the block competition rules .
the eu has been trying to get germany 's federal government to scrap or revise the so-called " vw law " - which privileges lower saxony despite that state possessing less than the 25 percent of shares normally required for a veto - since 2004 .
the european court of justice ruled the 48-year-old law invalid last october .
it was subsequently revised , but not enough to satisfy the bloc .

but it has come under increasing criticism in recent years , especially from porsche .
despite being smaller than the vw , the profitable , luxury-oriented company would like to take over the giant carmaker .
" this is completely in line with our thinking , " said a spokesman for porsche , which holds over 30 percent of voting rights in vw .
" we are firmly convinced there 's no need for a vw law . "
germany 's economic minister michael glos has also said he believes that the vw law is unnecessary and that the blocking clause favoring lower saxony could be removed .

but the bloc did not mention concrete security guarantees or membership prospects . probably the most heartening words from the summit for ukrainian president viktor yushchenko came at the concluding press conference , when summit chairman and french president nicolas sarkozy said that , in the eyes of europe , ukrainian territorial integrity was " non-negotiable . "
the meeting between yushchenko and representatives form the eu 's 27 member states came in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict and amidst ukrainian worries about moscow 's motives .
in a joint statement , eu member states " recognized that ukraine , as a european country , shares a common history and common values with the countries of the eu . "
the " association agreement " that emerged form the summit offers kiev enhanced status in its dealings with the eu .
but it does not say anything about whether ukraine could possibly join the bloc some day .
indeed the agreement , as sarkozy stressed to the press , " neither opens nor closes any route . "
for his part , yushchenko told reporters he was convinced that his country and the eu would sign " a very symbolic document cementing relations . "
" the main thing is that today we qualified as a european country , " yushchenko added .
" this is the first step of this great road that all countries which then became eu members , walked on . "
european divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian-georgian conflict has everyone worried about eastern europe but if the post-summit tone was warm , the statements and the agreement emerging from the meeting reflected the fact that the eu is not at all of a single mind as to where it stands vis-à-vis ukraine and russia .
" there are differing positions within the european council , " sarkozy said .
" and we explained to president yushchenko that this was the maximum we could promise him . "
britain , poland and sweden have been pushing the bloc to deepen ties with kiev to offset pressure from moscow .
but member states like germany , italy and the benelux countries want the eu to be more cautious and take more account of russia 's interests in eastern europe .
there are even questions as to whether the people of ukraine , with its heavy russian-speaking population , would truly welcome a more hard-line course toward moscow . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 09.09.2008 teams try to avoid dreaded bad start when season resumes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker mikael forssell is not yet a hanover helper many players are still with their national sides , but some bundesliga clubs are worrying about the season restart .
the week after the first break is traditionally when fans begin to get angry and coaches lose their jobs . the first few weeks of the season are like the initial ninety days of a new head of state 's term of office .
voters - or in the case of soccer , supporters - are willing to overlook fumbles and bumbles as part of the settling-in process .
but once the league emerges from its first break , club management and fans expect results .
and that puts serious pressure on the clubs who 've yet to chalk up a win .
hanover , in particular , will be feeling the heat .
touted by many observers in the pre-season as a possible top-five squad , they failed to score a goal in their first three matches and currently occupy the bottom spot in the table .
hanover coach dieter hecking has promised a turn-around this weekend against moenchengladbach .
but should he fail to get three points at home against a newly promoted opponent , his ears will be ringing with the one word all german coaches hate most - fehlstart .
more than just a bad beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus ' season has gotten off with a whimper fehlstart is , on the surface , just the german for bad beginning .
but in the culture of the bundesliga , it 's much more than that , something approaching an existential state of awfulness that can only be remedied with personnel changes .
and since the transfer window is closed , the only big move a club can make is firing the coach .
bojan prasnikar knows the score .
last september , he took over at energie cottbus after the small eastern german club had earned only two points from its first seven games .
now , he 's the one who 's having to answer endless fehlstart questions from baying-for-blood reporters , as cottbus has also failed to score and are tied at the bottom on one point .
but it 's unlikely prasnikar will be able to reverse energie 's fortunes straight away .
he 's going up this weekend against one of the bundesliga 's heavy hitters - and a team that 's fighting a fehlstart of its own .
quo vadis , werder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's schaaf wishes he could turn back time it 's no surprise to find the likes of bochum and bielefeld near the bottom and heading toward another season of merely battling for survival .
but werder bremen 's form has been shocking .
the side that usually plays the bundesliga 's most attractive football is off to its worst start in nine years , earning only a pair of draws and dropping five points to mediocre opposition .
having been at bremen 's helm for a decade , thomas schaaf is probably unfireable unless the bottom totally drops out .
but if they fail to hammer cottbus , expect changes to the squad - with ageing captain frank baumann looking to be a prime candidate for replacement .
werder are five points adrift of a spot in the champions league .
there 's plenty of time left to close that gap , but a disappointing result against massive underdogs cottbus would have fans and management asking some unpleasant existential questions about whether this squad is still truly among the bundesliga 's elite . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the bloc did not mention concrete security guarantees or membership prospects . probably the most heartening words from the summit for ukrainian president viktor yushchenko came at the concluding press conference , when summit chairman and french president nicolas sarkozy said that , in the eyes of europe , ukrainian territorial integrity was " non-negotiable . "
the meeting between yushchenko and representatives form the eu 's 27 member states came in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict and amidst ukrainian worries about moscow 's motives .
in a joint statement , eu member states " recognized that ukraine , as a european country , shares a common history and common values with the countries of the eu . "
the " association agreement " that emerged form the summit offers kiev enhanced status in its dealings with the eu .
but it does not say anything about whether ukraine could possibly join the bloc some day .
indeed the agreement , as sarkozy stressed to the press , " neither opens nor closes any route . "
for his part , yushchenko told reporters he was convinced that his country and the eu would sign " a very symbolic document cementing relations . "
" the main thing is that today we qualified as a european country , " yushchenko added .
" this is the first step of this great road that all countries which then became eu members , walked on . "
european divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian-georgian conflict has everyone worried about eastern europe but if the post-summit tone was warm , the statements and the agreement emerging from the meeting reflected the fact that the eu is not at all of a single mind as to where it stands vis-à-vis ukraine and russia .
" there are differing positions within the european council , " sarkozy said .
" and we explained to president yushchenko that this was the maximum we could promise him . "
britain , poland and sweden have been pushing the bloc to deepen ties with kiev to offset pressure from moscow .
but member states like germany , italy and the benelux countries want the eu to be more cautious and take more account of russia 's interests in eastern europe .
there are even questions as to whether the people of ukraine , with its heavy russian-speaking population , would truly welcome a more hard-line course toward moscow . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is this a case of a state guarding a company against free competition ? the eu is set to try to end a long-running dispute over whether a german law giving the state of lower saxony veto powers in vw 's affairs is in violation of the block competition rules .
the eu has been trying to get germany 's federal government to scrap or revise the so-called " vw law " - which privileges lower saxony despite that state possessing less than the 25 percent of shares normally required for a veto - since 2004 .
the european court of justice ruled the 48-year-old law invalid last october .
it was subsequently revised , but not enough to satisfy the bloc .
" the facts are clear - they 're not changing their positions , " said a spokesman for eu internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy in a statement .
eu legal action would begin " as soon as possible , " added the spokesman .
porsche to benefit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw is one of germany 's most recognizable brands officials for lower saxony in the city of hanover had no comment on the proposed legal action , other than to say that mccreedy 's position was known .
the vw law was enacted in 1960 to allow the state government to protect germany 's largest carmaker from foreign takeover .
but it has come under increasing criticism in recent years , especially from porsche .
despite being smaller than the vw , the profitable , luxury-oriented company would like to take over the giant carmaker .
" this is completely in line with our thinking , " said a spokesman for porsche , which holds over 30 percent of voting rights in vw .
" we are firmly convinced there 's no need for a vw law . "

is this a case of a state guarding a company against free competition ? the eu is set to try to end a long-running dispute over whether a german law giving the state of lower saxony veto powers in vw 's affairs is in violation of the block competition rules .
the eu has been trying to get germany 's federal government to scrap or revise the so-called " vw law " - which privileges lower saxony despite that state possessing less than the 25 percent of shares normally required for a veto - since 2004 .
the european court of justice ruled the 48-year-old law invalid last october .

through the abandonment of the negotiations over a partnership and cooperation settlement between the eu and russia , a unanimous europe has made it clear that it does not seek partnership with russia at any price .
that is how the eu has succeeded in making russia give in without having to use rhetoric to heat up the dispute .
the europeans ' calm , mediating politics has thus brought them a small symbolic win .
moscow 's clever chess tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel russia 's acceptance was , however , a clever chess tactic by president medvedev , since , in withdrawing its troops from the buffer zones , russia actually does not lose much ground .
the withdrawal plays no part regarding military strategy : russian army units continue to secure the renegade regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
neither has russia lost out from a diplomatic or political perspective : russia continues to disregard the principle of georgia 's territorial integrity by its recognition of abkhazian and south ossetian independence .
russia 's agreement to europe 's demand of withdrawing troops from the buffer zone should therefore not be seen as a political turning point in the caucasus conflict .
it is much more a symbolic gesture to europe .
russia has also made the decision not to heat up the dispute with europe further - but no more than that .
on the same day as the withdrawal agreement , there were further signs that the conflict is simply moving into a second stage as georgia accused russia of ethnic cleansing at the international court in the hague .
conflict continues sarkozy 's visit is a long way from reaching a solution to the caucasus conflict .
the fundamental problem remains : russia has used georgian aggression against the separatist regime in south ossetia to recognize the independence of the pro-russian regions .
in doing so , moscow has violated the principle of the invulnerability of post-soviet territory borders - also legally - for the first time since the fall of the soviet union 17 years ago .
that does not just mean a dangerous situation for georgia , but a threatening development for peace on the eurasian continent .
that is why a caucasus stability pact is necessary - a pact which russia and the eu are hopefully drawing closer to with the arrangement to send over 200 eu observers to oversee the ceasefire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 09.09.2008 germany grudgingly accepts landmark nuclear deal with india großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the deal with india is a setback for nuclear non-proliferation efforts germany has grudgingly accepted a landmark civilian nuclear trade deal with india which gives the asian giant the green light to buy nuclear fuel and technology on the global market . german foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said this week germany - as chair of the 45-nation nuclear suppliers group , which controls the export and sale of nuclear technology - had tried to balance conflicting interests during tense negotiations that led to the landmark agreement .
" there were several countries that put critical questions to india , but also the united states , about how this arrangement is compatible with the common goal of nuclear non-proliferation , " ploetner told a news conference on monday , sept 8 .
" it is not an ideal solution .
the negotiations were very difficult and we can not say that we could not have imagined something better . "
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- is a group of 45 states that control the international sale of nuclear technology .
the deal with india is a key step in sealing the india-us atomic technology accord signed by us president george w. bush and indian premier manmohan singh in 2005 .
the us-india business council , one of the champions of the pact between new delhi and washington , said the nsg 's decision could unlock nuclear energy investment in india worth more than $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- .
the controversial agreement , signed on saturday , sept .
6 , means germany and other states can start jostling for a strong position in the race to sell nuclear know-how and technology to india .
a controversial decision the us had been hoping for a quick decision on the embargo , so that the current us congress could ratify the accord before elections in november .
us lawmakers are pushing for a vote by the end of september .
the decision to lift the embargo was controversial , in part because india - which was embargoed in the first place after it developed and tested nuclear weapons test in 1974 - has so far refused to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and singh signed a nukes deal in 2005 the us exerted the most pressure on the nsg to lift the embargo .
it argues that cooperation in the civilian nuclear sector could bring india closer to signing on to the international nuclear non proliferation treaty , and that an increase in atomic energy sources will help in the fight against global warming .
but critics - such as austria , ireland and new zealand , supported by china - warned that india is being rewarded for its long-time insistence on a right to nuclear technology ; they fear india could use atomic technology for military ends .
moreover , the nsg stance undermines its negotiating power when it comes to dealing with states such as iran and pakistan , opponents argue .
germany shows grudging acceptance the last nsg member state to finally agree to lift the india embargo was austria .
it signed only after india formally decreed it would adhere to a moratorium on further atomic-bomb tests .
germany , which currently chairs the nsg , expressed grudging acceptance of the landmark atomic energy deal .
it , too , denied the accord undermines the west 's efforts to convince iran to stop sensitive nuclear work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's ahmadinejad wants to expand his program asked whether the pact contradicted the west 's united opposition to iran 's controversial nuclear program , ploetner told afp news service that the nuclear suppliers group had underscored the goal of non-proliferation with the agreement .
germany : iaea approval was key " does this agreement send an approving message to iran ?
no , it absolutely does not , " ploetner said , calling india a " special case . "

" there were several countries that put critical questions to india , but also the united states , about how this arrangement is compatible with the common goal of nuclear non-proliferation , " ploetner told a news conference on monday , sept 8 .
" it is not an ideal solution .
the negotiations were very difficult and we can not say that we could not have imagined something better . "
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- is a group of 45 states that control the international sale of nuclear technology .
the deal with india is a key step in sealing the india-us atomic technology accord signed by us president george w. bush and indian premier manmohan singh in 2005 .
the us-india business council , one of the champions of the pact between new delhi and washington , said the nsg 's decision could unlock nuclear energy investment in india worth more than $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- .
the controversial agreement , signed on saturday , sept .
6 , means germany and other states can start jostling for a strong position in the race to sell nuclear know-how and technology to india .
a controversial decision the us had been hoping for a quick decision on the embargo , so that the current us congress could ratify the accord before elections in november .
us lawmakers are pushing for a vote by the end of september .
the decision to lift the embargo was controversial , in part because india - which was embargoed in the first place after it developed and tested nuclear weapons test in 1974 - has so far refused to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and singh signed a nukes deal in 2005 the us exerted the most pressure on the nsg to lift the embargo .
it argues that cooperation in the civilian nuclear sector could bring india closer to signing on to the international nuclear non proliferation treaty , and that an increase in atomic energy sources will help in the fight against global warming .
but critics - such as austria , ireland and new zealand , supported by china - warned that india is being rewarded for its long-time insistence on a right to nuclear technology ; they fear india could use atomic technology for military ends .
moreover , the nsg stance undermines its negotiating power when it comes to dealing with states such as iran and pakistan , opponents argue .
germany shows grudging acceptance the last nsg member state to finally agree to lift the india embargo was austria .
it signed only after india formally decreed it would adhere to a moratorium on further atomic-bomb tests .
germany , which currently chairs the nsg , expressed grudging acceptance of the landmark atomic energy deal .
it , too , denied the accord undermines the west 's efforts to convince iran to stop sensitive nuclear work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's ahmadinejad wants to expand his program asked whether the pact contradicted the west 's united opposition to iran 's controversial nuclear program , ploetner told afp news service that the nuclear suppliers group had underscored the goal of non-proliferation with the agreement .
germany : iaea approval was key " does this agreement send an approving message to iran ?

" there were several countries that put critical questions to india , but also the united states , about how this arrangement is compatible with the common goal of nuclear non-proliferation , " ploetner told a news conference on monday , sept 8 .
" it is not an ideal solution .
the negotiations were very difficult and we can not say that we could not have imagined something better . "
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- is a group of 45 states that control the international sale of nuclear technology .
the deal with india is a key step in sealing the india-us atomic technology accord signed by us president george w. bush and indian premier manmohan singh in 2005 .
the us-india business council , one of the champions of the pact between new delhi and washington , said the nsg 's decision could unlock nuclear energy investment in india worth more than $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- .
the controversial agreement , signed on saturday , sept .
6 , means germany and other states can start jostling for a strong position in the race to sell nuclear know-how and technology to india .
a controversial decision the us had been hoping for a quick decision on the embargo , so that the current us congress could ratify the accord before elections in november .
us lawmakers are pushing for a vote by the end of september .
the decision to lift the embargo was controversial , in part because india - which was embargoed in the first place after it developed and tested nuclear weapons test in 1974 - has so far refused to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and singh signed a nukes deal in 2005 the us exerted the most pressure on the nsg to lift the embargo .

but critics are n't convinced . swedish energy utility vattenfall sees carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- as a revolutionary answer to global warming which is largely blamed on carbon dioxide released when fossil fuels burn .
" this technology will become more important than offshore wind farms , " said vattenfall boss lars josefsson .
" our project at schwarze pumpe puts us at the forefront of this technology in the world , " said tuomo hatakka , the chief executive of vattenfall europe , referring to the the 70-million euro plant in eastern germany .
vattenfall , one of europe 's largest energy companies , hopes the project will help provide energy security through plentiful coal supplies while avoiding the co2 emissions that are blamed for global warming .
vattenfall underscores " clean technology " aspect a finnish-born executive who heads the swedish group 's berlin-based subsidiary , hatakka told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the process was viable because companies will have to buy eu allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ccs test plant has drawn prominent visitors including chancellor merkel " in tandem with eu-wide trading in emission rights , ccs will be economic .
at 30 to 35 euros per emission certificate , the technology breaks even , " he said .
the 30-megawatt pilot plant at schwarze pumpe in the lausitz region of eastern germany is very small compared to conventional power stations .
but it 's the first coal-fired power plant in the world ready to capture and store its own carbon dioxide emissions - a so-called ccs plant .
carbon dioxide emitted when lignite coal burns will not be vented up a chimney but piped away , compressed to a liquid and pumped into deep , porous rock .
the concentrated carbon dioxide will then be injected " for permanent storage " in a gas field in northern germany .
vattenfall plans to build two " demonstration plants " 10 times that size in germany and denmark by 2015 at the latest .
hatakka said the company aimed to commission its first " large-scale ccs power station " in 2020 .
the outcome of this new plant will be heat , water vapor , nine tons of co2 per hour and a milestone in clean energy technology , according to markus füller , a spokesman for vattenfall .
“ this process is necessary if we ever hope to continue using soft , lignite coal , he says .
we need to get a handle on the co2 problem , and we think this technology is the way to do it , " füller said .
critics are n't convinced but environmentalists say the technology uses far more energy than existing power generation and warn that there are no secure long-term storage facilities for the gas .
german conservation group bund on monday denounced the project as simply a cover allowing vattenfall to expand its network of conventional coal-fired power stations in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say the focus should be on expanding cheaper renewable energy rather than on polluting coal thorben becker of bund said it was still uncertain if ccs worked on a large scale .
ccs power stations would obtain 10 per cent less power from the coal than conventional plants did , and it was not clear if there were enough suitable sites to dump the co2 .
" instead of concentrating on far cheaper renewable energy , vattenfall is locking itself in for decades to converting climate-damaging brown coal into electricity , " he said .
the european union wants to have 10 or 12 full-scale ccs power stations within the next few years , but it is not clear who will pay the high costs of building and running the plants . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics are n't convinced . swedish energy utility vattenfall sees carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- as a revolutionary answer to global warming which is largely blamed on carbon dioxide released when fossil fuels burn .
" this technology will become more important than offshore wind farms , " said vattenfall boss lars josefsson .
" our project at schwarze pumpe puts us at the forefront of this technology in the world , " said tuomo hatakka , the chief executive of vattenfall europe , referring to the the 70-million euro plant in eastern germany .
vattenfall , one of europe 's largest energy companies , hopes the project will help provide energy security through plentiful coal supplies while avoiding the co2 emissions that are blamed for global warming .
vattenfall underscores " clean technology " aspect a finnish-born executive who heads the swedish group 's berlin-based subsidiary , hatakka told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the process was viable because companies will have to buy eu allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the air .

at 30 to 35 euros per emission certificate , the technology breaks even , " he said .
the 30-megawatt pilot plant at schwarze pumpe in the lausitz region of eastern germany is very small compared to conventional power stations .
but it 's the first coal-fired power plant in the world ready to capture and store its own carbon dioxide emissions - a so-called ccs plant .
carbon dioxide emitted when lignite coal burns will not be vented up a chimney but piped away , compressed to a liquid and pumped into deep , porous rock .
the concentrated carbon dioxide will then be injected " for permanent storage " in a gas field in northern germany .
vattenfall plans to build two " demonstration plants " 10 times that size in germany and denmark by 2015 at the latest .
hatakka said the company aimed to commission its first " large-scale ccs power station " in 2020 .
the outcome of this new plant will be heat , water vapor , nine tons of co2 per hour and a milestone in clean energy technology , according to markus füller , a spokesman for vattenfall .

8 gaertner told the ap news agency that his comments had been taken out of context .
security experts are concerned the chrome browser uses a number for each user that is set up during installation and then communicated to a central server every time the product is in use for the purpose of collecting usage statistics such as details of program crashes .
critics are concerned that the number could be used to identify users .
google rejects security concerns but kay oberbeck , speaking for google , told the dpa news agency : " there are no connections made between the installation number and the entries in the search box or address box . "
the system of attributing a number to each user is not particular to this new google product .
mozilla , the browser of the non-commercial firefox brand , also sends a user number the software company 's server .
another concern about the product is that it collects data from users for use in functions such as the " omnibox " which remembers the topics of previous searches and suggests possible search topics .
google confirms that it saves two percent of data , including users ip addresses .
" this data is necessary to generate the completed search suggestions , " oberbeck explained .
oberbeck also stressed that user information is gathered in a way that makes the users anonymous , and he said that the function can be turned off simply .
critics have also said that , in releasing a test version of the product , google has given users a false sense of security .
" google should have clearly told its users that this is a beta version meant for testing , " daniel bachfeld of the german " c 't " computer magazine told dpa news agency .

a berlin newspaper quoted a spokesman for the federal office of information matthias gaertner at the weekend saying that the chrome browser " should not be used for general use . "
since then there have been reports that the federal office for information security has issued an official warning against using the new google browser .
but on monday sep .
8 gaertner told the ap news agency that his comments had been taken out of context .
security experts are concerned the chrome browser uses a number for each user that is set up during installation and then communicated to a central server every time the product is in use for the purpose of collecting usage statistics such as details of program crashes .
critics are concerned that the number could be used to identify users .
google rejects security concerns but kay oberbeck , speaking for google , told the dpa news agency : " there are no connections made between the installation number and the entries in the search box or address box . "
the system of attributing a number to each user is not particular to this new google product .
mozilla , the browser of the non-commercial firefox brand , also sends a user number the software company 's server .
another concern about the product is that it collects data from users for use in functions such as the " omnibox " which remembers the topics of previous searches and suggests possible search topics .
google confirms that it saves two percent of data , including users ip addresses .
" this data is necessary to generate the completed search suggestions , " oberbeck explained .
oberbeck also stressed that user information is gathered in a way that makes the users anonymous , and he said that the function can be turned off simply .
critics have also said that , in releasing a test version of the product , google has given users a false sense of security .
" google should have clearly told its users that this is a beta version meant for testing , " daniel bachfeld of the german " c 't " computer magazine told dpa news agency .
spokesman for google germany stefan keuchel said that the beta version was released because it allows for more flexibility in finding bugs , fixing glitches and addressing feedback from users . dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the bloc did not mention concrete security guarantees or membership prospects . probably the most heartening words from the summit for ukrainian president viktor yushchenko came at the concluding press conference , when summit chairman and french president nicolas sarkozy said that , in the eyes of europe , ukrainian territorial integrity was " non-negotiable . "
the meeting between yushchenko and representatives form the eu 's 27 member states came in the aftermath of the russia-georgia conflict and amidst ukrainian worries about moscow 's motives .
in a joint statement , eu member states " recognized that ukraine , as a european country , shares a common history and common values with the countries of the eu . "
the " association agreement " that emerged form the summit offers kiev enhanced status in its dealings with the eu .
but it does not say anything about whether ukraine could possibly join the bloc some day .
indeed the agreement , as sarkozy stressed to the press , " neither opens nor closes any route . "
for his part , yushchenko told reporters he was convinced that his country and the eu would sign " a very symbolic document cementing relations . "
" the main thing is that today we qualified as a european country , " yushchenko added .
" this is the first step of this great road that all countries which then became eu members , walked on . "

" and we explained to president yushchenko that this was the maximum we could promise him . "
britain , poland and sweden have been pushing the bloc to deepen ties with kiev to offset pressure from moscow .
but member states like germany , italy and the benelux countries want the eu to be more cautious and take more account of russia 's interests in eastern europe .

is this a case of a state guarding a company against free competition ? the eu is set to try to end a long-running dispute over whether a german law giving the state of lower saxony veto powers in vw 's affairs is in violation of the block competition rules .
the eu has been trying to get germany 's federal government to scrap or revise the so-called " vw law " - which privileges lower saxony despite that state possessing less than the 25 percent of shares normally required for a veto - since 2004 .
the european court of justice ruled the 48-year-old law invalid last october .
it was subsequently revised , but not enough to satisfy the bloc .

but it has come under increasing criticism in recent years , especially from porsche .
despite being smaller than the vw , the profitable , luxury-oriented company would like to take over the giant carmaker .
" this is completely in line with our thinking , " said a spokesman for porsche , which holds over 30 percent of voting rights in vw .
" we are firmly convinced there 's no need for a vw law . "

is this a case of a state guarding a company against free competition ? the eu is set to try to end a long-running dispute over whether a german law giving the state of lower saxony veto powers in vw 's affairs is in violation of the block competition rules .
the eu has been trying to get germany 's federal government to scrap or revise the so-called " vw law " - which privileges lower saxony despite that state possessing less than the 25 percent of shares normally required for a veto - since 2004 .
the european court of justice ruled the 48-year-old law invalid last october .
it was subsequently revised , but not enough to satisfy the bloc .

the vw law was enacted in 1960 to allow the state government to protect germany 's largest carmaker from foreign takeover .
but it has come under increasing criticism in recent years , especially from porsche .
despite being smaller than the vw , the profitable , luxury-oriented company would like to take over the giant carmaker .
" this is completely in line with our thinking , " said a spokesman for porsche , which holds over 30 percent of voting rights in vw .
" we are firmly convinced there 's no need for a vw law . "
germany 's economic minister michael glos has also said he believes that the vw law is unnecessary and that the blocking clause favoring lower saxony could be removed .

through the abandonment of the negotiations over a partnership and cooperation settlement between the eu and russia , a unanimous europe has made it clear that it does not seek partnership with russia at any price .
that is how the eu has succeeded in making russia give in without having to use rhetoric to heat up the dispute .

moscow 's clever chess tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel russia 's acceptance was , however , a clever chess tactic by president medvedev , since , in withdrawing its troops from the buffer zones , russia actually does not lose much ground .
the withdrawal plays no part regarding military strategy : russian army units continue to secure the renegade regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
neither has russia lost out from a diplomatic or political perspective : russia continues to disregard the principle of georgia 's territorial integrity by its recognition of abkhazian and south ossetian independence .
russia 's agreement to europe 's demand of withdrawing troops from the buffer zone should therefore not be seen as a political turning point in the caucasus conflict .
it is much more a symbolic gesture to europe .
russia has also made the decision not to heat up the dispute with europe further - but no more than that .
on the same day as the withdrawal agreement , there were further signs that the conflict is simply moving into a second stage as georgia accused russia of ethnic cleansing at the international court in the hague .
conflict continues sarkozy 's visit is a long way from reaching a solution to the caucasus conflict .
the fundamental problem remains : russia has used georgian aggression against the separatist regime in south ossetia to recognize the independence of the pro-russian regions .
in doing so , moscow has violated the principle of the invulnerability of post-soviet territory borders - also legally - for the first time since the fall of the soviet union 17 years ago .
that does not just mean a dangerous situation for georgia , but a threatening development for peace on the eurasian continent .
that is why a caucasus stability pact is necessary - a pact which russia and the eu are hopefully drawing closer to with the arrangement to send over 200 eu observers to oversee the ceasefire .

through the abandonment of the negotiations over a partnership and cooperation settlement between the eu and russia , a unanimous europe has made it clear that it does not seek partnership with russia at any price .
that is how the eu has succeeded in making russia give in without having to use rhetoric to heat up the dispute .
the europeans ' calm , mediating politics has thus brought them a small symbolic win .
moscow 's clever chess tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel russia 's acceptance was , however , a clever chess tactic by president medvedev , since , in withdrawing its troops from the buffer zones , russia actually does not lose much ground .
the withdrawal plays no part regarding military strategy : russian army units continue to secure the renegade regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
neither has russia lost out from a diplomatic or political perspective : russia continues to disregard the principle of georgia 's territorial integrity by its recognition of abkhazian and south ossetian independence .
russia 's agreement to europe 's demand of withdrawing troops from the buffer zone should therefore not be seen as a political turning point in the caucasus conflict .
it is much more a symbolic gesture to europe .
russia has also made the decision not to heat up the dispute with europe further - but no more than that .
on the same day as the withdrawal agreement , there were further signs that the conflict is simply moving into a second stage as georgia accused russia of ethnic cleansing at the international court in the hague .
conflict continues sarkozy 's visit is a long way from reaching a solution to the caucasus conflict .
the fundamental problem remains : russia has used georgian aggression against the separatist regime in south ossetia to recognize the independence of the pro-russian regions .
in doing so , moscow has violated the principle of the invulnerability of post-soviet territory borders - also legally - for the first time since the fall of the soviet union 17 years ago .

the device is to be manufactured in germany . the as-yet-unnamed device is the size of a piece of standard printer paper and the screen allows users to annotate documents and will offer the option of embedding video .
the new invention was shown off at an industry event called demofall in san diego .
it is due to go on sale early next year and is expected to be embraced by newspaper publishers eager to cut the costs associated with printing and distributing paper editions .
the device uses technology from e-ink , the company that also powers electronic readers from sony and amazon .
but the screen of the plastic logic gadget is built with transistor arrays on flexible plastic surfaces that are lighter , stronger , less expensive and more environmentally friendly than the silicon-based systems in use until now .
the plastic reader is designed to store dozens or hundreds of business documents on a very thin digital reader .
it can store e-books , magazines , newspapers , pdf files and all kinds of information , the company said .
" even though we have positioned this for business documents , newspapers -lrb- are -rrb- what everyone asks for , " said richard archuleta , plastic logic 's ceo .

but critics are n't convinced . swedish energy utility vattenfall sees carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- as a revolutionary answer to global warming which is largely blamed on carbon dioxide released when fossil fuels burn .
" this technology will become more important than offshore wind farms , " said vattenfall boss lars josefsson .
" our project at schwarze pumpe puts us at the forefront of this technology in the world , " said tuomo hatakka , the chief executive of vattenfall europe , referring to the the 70-million euro plant in eastern germany .
vattenfall , one of europe 's largest energy companies , hopes the project will help provide energy security through plentiful coal supplies while avoiding the co2 emissions that are blamed for global warming .
vattenfall underscores " clean technology " aspect a finnish-born executive who heads the swedish group 's berlin-based subsidiary , hatakka told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the process was viable because companies will have to buy eu allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ccs test plant has drawn prominent visitors including chancellor merkel " in tandem with eu-wide trading in emission rights , ccs will be economic .
at 30 to 35 euros per emission certificate , the technology breaks even , " he said .
the 30-megawatt pilot plant at schwarze pumpe in the lausitz region of eastern germany is very small compared to conventional power stations .
but it 's the first coal-fired power plant in the world ready to capture and store its own carbon dioxide emissions - a so-called ccs plant .
carbon dioxide emitted when lignite coal burns will not be vented up a chimney but piped away , compressed to a liquid and pumped into deep , porous rock .
the concentrated carbon dioxide will then be injected " for permanent storage " in a gas field in northern germany .
vattenfall plans to build two " demonstration plants " 10 times that size in germany and denmark by 2015 at the latest .
hatakka said the company aimed to commission its first " large-scale ccs power station " in 2020 .
the outcome of this new plant will be heat , water vapor , nine tons of co2 per hour and a milestone in clean energy technology , according to markus füller , a spokesman for vattenfall .
“ this process is necessary if we ever hope to continue using soft , lignite coal , he says .
we need to get a handle on the co2 problem , and we think this technology is the way to do it , " füller said .
critics are n't convinced but environmentalists say the technology uses far more energy than existing power generation and warn that there are no secure long-term storage facilities for the gas .
german conservation group bund on monday denounced the project as simply a cover allowing vattenfall to expand its network of conventional coal-fired power stations in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say the focus should be on expanding cheaper renewable energy rather than on polluting coal thorben becker of bund said it was still uncertain if ccs worked on a large scale .
ccs power stations would obtain 10 per cent less power from the coal than conventional plants did , and it was not clear if there were enough suitable sites to dump the co2 .
" instead of concentrating on far cheaper renewable energy , vattenfall is locking itself in for decades to converting climate-damaging brown coal into electricity , " he said .
the european union wants to have 10 or 12 full-scale ccs power stations within the next few years , but it is not clear who will pay the high costs of building and running the plants . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics are n't convinced . swedish energy utility vattenfall sees carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- as a revolutionary answer to global warming which is largely blamed on carbon dioxide released when fossil fuels burn .
" this technology will become more important than offshore wind farms , " said vattenfall boss lars josefsson .
" our project at schwarze pumpe puts us at the forefront of this technology in the world , " said tuomo hatakka , the chief executive of vattenfall europe , referring to the the 70-million euro plant in eastern germany .
vattenfall , one of europe 's largest energy companies , hopes the project will help provide energy security through plentiful coal supplies while avoiding the co2 emissions that are blamed for global warming .
vattenfall underscores " clean technology " aspect a finnish-born executive who heads the swedish group 's berlin-based subsidiary , hatakka told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the process was viable because companies will have to buy eu allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the air .

we need to get a handle on the co2 problem , and we think this technology is the way to do it , " füller said .

" there were several countries that put critical questions to india , but also the united states , about how this arrangement is compatible with the common goal of nuclear non-proliferation , " ploetner told a news conference on monday , sept 8 .
" it is not an ideal solution .
the negotiations were very difficult and we can not say that we could not have imagined something better . "
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- is a group of 45 states that control the international sale of nuclear technology .
the deal with india is a key step in sealing the india-us atomic technology accord signed by us president george w. bush and indian premier manmohan singh in 2005 .
the us-india business council , one of the champions of the pact between new delhi and washington , said the nsg 's decision could unlock nuclear energy investment in india worth more than $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- .
the controversial agreement , signed on saturday , sept .
6 , means germany and other states can start jostling for a strong position in the race to sell nuclear know-how and technology to india .
a controversial decision the us had been hoping for a quick decision on the embargo , so that the current us congress could ratify the accord before elections in november .
us lawmakers are pushing for a vote by the end of september .
the decision to lift the embargo was controversial , in part because india - which was embargoed in the first place after it developed and tested nuclear weapons test in 1974 - has so far refused to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and singh signed a nukes deal in 2005 the us exerted the most pressure on the nsg to lift the embargo .
it argues that cooperation in the civilian nuclear sector could bring india closer to signing on to the international nuclear non proliferation treaty , and that an increase in atomic energy sources will help in the fight against global warming .
but critics - such as austria , ireland and new zealand , supported by china - warned that india is being rewarded for its long-time insistence on a right to nuclear technology ; they fear india could use atomic technology for military ends .
moreover , the nsg stance undermines its negotiating power when it comes to dealing with states such as iran and pakistan , opponents argue .
germany shows grudging acceptance the last nsg member state to finally agree to lift the india embargo was austria .
it signed only after india formally decreed it would adhere to a moratorium on further atomic-bomb tests .
germany , which currently chairs the nsg , expressed grudging acceptance of the landmark atomic energy deal .
it , too , denied the accord undermines the west 's efforts to convince iran to stop sensitive nuclear work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's ahmadinejad wants to expand his program asked whether the pact contradicted the west 's united opposition to iran 's controversial nuclear program , ploetner told afp news service that the nuclear suppliers group had underscored the goal of non-proliferation with the agreement .
germany : iaea approval was key " does this agreement send an approving message to iran ?
no , it absolutely does not , " ploetner said , calling india a " special case . "
ploetner added that the approval of the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , the vienna-based international atomic energy agency , had been decisive in winning approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting the iaea to sign on was a key part of the deal germany is among six countries working to convince tehran to abandon uranium enrichment , which the west fears is a pretense for building an iranian nuclear weapon .
iran says its nuclear program is for civilian purposes only .
jostling for contracts has begun meanwhile , the us forecasts that india 's growing energy needs mean it will have to build at least eight new atomic energy plants by 2012 .
britain , france and russia have already joined the us in jostling for lucrative contracts .
and during the celebration of the 50th anniversary of a german-supported technical university earlier this week in chennai , india , german technology minister annette schavan was warmly greeted by her indian counterpart kipal sibal .
" we have to see the next 50 years of cooperation in the light of the events of this past weekend , " sibal said at the celebration .
in cooperation with germany , india could find out " which components and what know-how is important for us , " he added bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has a strong footing in atomic energy while the nsg decision means india is now technically free to trade on the world market , indian leaders said late monday , sept .
8 , they would seek to clinch international nuclear deals only after the india-us atomic agreement is cleared by the us congress .
on tuesday , sept .
9 , the white house said it was " hopeful " congress would pass the landmark cooperation deal before president bush 's term ends in january . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there were several countries that put critical questions to india , but also the united states , about how this arrangement is compatible with the common goal of nuclear non-proliferation , " ploetner told a news conference on monday , sept 8 .
" it is not an ideal solution .
the negotiations were very difficult and we can not say that we could not have imagined something better . "
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- is a group of 45 states that control the international sale of nuclear technology .
the deal with india is a key step in sealing the india-us atomic technology accord signed by us president george w. bush and indian premier manmohan singh in 2005 .
the us-india business council , one of the champions of the pact between new delhi and washington , said the nsg 's decision could unlock nuclear energy investment in india worth more than $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- .
the controversial agreement , signed on saturday , sept .
6 , means germany and other states can start jostling for a strong position in the race to sell nuclear know-how and technology to india .
a controversial decision the us had been hoping for a quick decision on the embargo , so that the current us congress could ratify the accord before elections in november .
us lawmakers are pushing for a vote by the end of september .
the decision to lift the embargo was controversial , in part because india - which was embargoed in the first place after it developed and tested nuclear weapons test in 1974 - has so far refused to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and singh signed a nukes deal in 2005 the us exerted the most pressure on the nsg to lift the embargo .
it argues that cooperation in the civilian nuclear sector could bring india closer to signing on to the international nuclear non proliferation treaty , and that an increase in atomic energy sources will help in the fight against global warming .
but critics - such as austria , ireland and new zealand , supported by china - warned that india is being rewarded for its long-time insistence on a right to nuclear technology ; they fear india could use atomic technology for military ends .
moreover , the nsg stance undermines its negotiating power when it comes to dealing with states such as iran and pakistan , opponents argue .
germany shows grudging acceptance the last nsg member state to finally agree to lift the india embargo was austria .
it signed only after india formally decreed it would adhere to a moratorium on further atomic-bomb tests .
germany , which currently chairs the nsg , expressed grudging acceptance of the landmark atomic energy deal .
it , too , denied the accord undermines the west 's efforts to convince iran to stop sensitive nuclear work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's ahmadinejad wants to expand his program asked whether the pact contradicted the west 's united opposition to iran 's controversial nuclear program , ploetner told afp news service that the nuclear suppliers group had underscored the goal of non-proliferation with the agreement .
germany : iaea approval was key " does this agreement send an approving message to iran ?
no , it absolutely does not , " ploetner said , calling india a " special case . "
ploetner added that the approval of the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , the vienna-based international atomic energy agency , had been decisive in winning approval .

jostling for contracts has begun meanwhile , the us forecasts that india 's growing energy needs mean it will have to build at least eight new atomic energy plants by 2012 .
britain , france and russia have already joined the us in jostling for lucrative contracts .

the week after the first break is traditionally when fans begin to get angry and coaches lose their jobs . the first few weeks of the season are like the initial ninety days of a new head of state 's term of office .
voters - or in the case of soccer , supporters - are willing to overlook fumbles and bumbles as part of the settling-in process .
but once the league emerges from its first break , club management and fans expect results .
and that puts serious pressure on the clubs who 've yet to chalk up a win .
hanover , in particular , will be feeling the heat .
touted by many observers in the pre-season as a possible top-five squad , they failed to score a goal in their first three matches and currently occupy the bottom spot in the table .
hanover coach dieter hecking has promised a turn-around this weekend against moenchengladbach .
but should he fail to get three points at home against a newly promoted opponent , his ears will be ringing with the one word all german coaches hate most - fehlstart .
more than just a bad beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus ' season has gotten off with a whimper fehlstart is , on the surface , just the german for bad beginning .
but in the culture of the bundesliga , it 's much more than that , something approaching an existential state of awfulness that can only be remedied with personnel changes .
and since the transfer window is closed , the only big move a club can make is firing the coach .
bojan prasnikar knows the score .
last september , he took over at energie cottbus after the small eastern german club had earned only two points from its first seven games .
now , he 's the one who 's having to answer endless fehlstart questions from baying-for-blood reporters , as cottbus has also failed to score and are tied at the bottom on one point .
but it 's unlikely prasnikar will be able to reverse energie 's fortunes straight away .
he 's going up this weekend against one of the bundesliga 's heavy hitters - and a team that 's fighting a fehlstart of its own .

but werder bremen 's form has been shocking .
the side that usually plays the bundesliga 's most attractive football is off to its worst start in nine years , earning only a pair of draws and dropping five points to mediocre opposition .
having been at bremen 's helm for a decade , thomas schaaf is probably unfireable unless the bottom totally drops out .
but if they fail to hammer cottbus , expect changes to the squad - with ageing captain frank baumann looking to be a prime candidate for replacement .
werder are five points adrift of a spot in the champions league .

a berlin newspaper quoted a spokesman for the federal office of information matthias gaertner at the weekend saying that the chrome browser " should not be used for general use . "
since then there have been reports that the federal office for information security has issued an official warning against using the new google browser .
but on monday sep .
8 gaertner told the ap news agency that his comments had been taken out of context .
security experts are concerned the chrome browser uses a number for each user that is set up during installation and then communicated to a central server every time the product is in use for the purpose of collecting usage statistics such as details of program crashes .
critics are concerned that the number could be used to identify users .
google rejects security concerns but kay oberbeck , speaking for google , told the dpa news agency : " there are no connections made between the installation number and the entries in the search box or address box . "
the system of attributing a number to each user is not particular to this new google product .
mozilla , the browser of the non-commercial firefox brand , also sends a user number the software company 's server .
another concern about the product is that it collects data from users for use in functions such as the " omnibox " which remembers the topics of previous searches and suggests possible search topics .
google confirms that it saves two percent of data , including users ip addresses .
" this data is necessary to generate the completed search suggestions , " oberbeck explained .
oberbeck also stressed that user information is gathered in a way that makes the users anonymous , and he said that the function can be turned off simply .
critics have also said that , in releasing a test version of the product , google has given users a false sense of security .
" google should have clearly told its users that this is a beta version meant for testing , " daniel bachfeld of the german " c 't " computer magazine told dpa news agency .

a berlin newspaper quoted a spokesman for the federal office of information matthias gaertner at the weekend saying that the chrome browser " should not be used for general use . "
since then there have been reports that the federal office for information security has issued an official warning against using the new google browser .
but on monday sep .
8 gaertner told the ap news agency that his comments had been taken out of context .
security experts are concerned the chrome browser uses a number for each user that is set up during installation and then communicated to a central server every time the product is in use for the purpose of collecting usage statistics such as details of program crashes .
critics are concerned that the number could be used to identify users .
google rejects security concerns but kay oberbeck , speaking for google , told the dpa news agency : " there are no connections made between the installation number and the entries in the search box or address box . "
the system of attributing a number to each user is not particular to this new google product .
mozilla , the browser of the non-commercial firefox brand , also sends a user number the software company 's server .
another concern about the product is that it collects data from users for use in functions such as the " omnibox " which remembers the topics of previous searches and suggests possible search topics .
google confirms that it saves two percent of data , including users ip addresses .
" this data is necessary to generate the completed search suggestions , " oberbeck explained .
oberbeck also stressed that user information is gathered in a way that makes the users anonymous , and he said that the function can be turned off simply .
critics have also said that , in releasing a test version of the product , google has given users a false sense of security .
" google should have clearly told its users that this is a beta version meant for testing , " daniel bachfeld of the german " c 't " computer magazine told dpa news agency .
spokesman for google germany stefan keuchel said that the beta version was released because it allows for more flexibility in finding bugs , fixing glitches and addressing feedback from users . dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 09.09.2008 teams try to avoid dreaded bad start when season resumes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker mikael forssell is not yet a hanover helper many players are still with their national sides , but some bundesliga clubs are worrying about the season restart .
the week after the first break is traditionally when fans begin to get angry and coaches lose their jobs . the first few weeks of the season are like the initial ninety days of a new head of state 's term of office .
voters - or in the case of soccer , supporters - are willing to overlook fumbles and bumbles as part of the settling-in process .
but once the league emerges from its first break , club management and fans expect results .
and that puts serious pressure on the clubs who 've yet to chalk up a win .
hanover , in particular , will be feeling the heat .
touted by many observers in the pre-season as a possible top-five squad , they failed to score a goal in their first three matches and currently occupy the bottom spot in the table .
hanover coach dieter hecking has promised a turn-around this weekend against moenchengladbach .
but should he fail to get three points at home against a newly promoted opponent , his ears will be ringing with the one word all german coaches hate most - fehlstart .
more than just a bad beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus ' season has gotten off with a whimper fehlstart is , on the surface , just the german for bad beginning .
but in the culture of the bundesliga , it 's much more than that , something approaching an existential state of awfulness that can only be remedied with personnel changes .
and since the transfer window is closed , the only big move a club can make is firing the coach .
bojan prasnikar knows the score .
last september , he took over at energie cottbus after the small eastern german club had earned only two points from its first seven games .
now , he 's the one who 's having to answer endless fehlstart questions from baying-for-blood reporters , as cottbus has also failed to score and are tied at the bottom on one point .
but it 's unlikely prasnikar will be able to reverse energie 's fortunes straight away .
he 's going up this weekend against one of the bundesliga 's heavy hitters - and a team that 's fighting a fehlstart of its own .
quo vadis , werder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's schaaf wishes he could turn back time it 's no surprise to find the likes of bochum and bielefeld near the bottom and heading toward another season of merely battling for survival .
but werder bremen 's form has been shocking .
the side that usually plays the bundesliga 's most attractive football is off to its worst start in nine years , earning only a pair of draws and dropping five points to mediocre opposition .
having been at bremen 's helm for a decade , thomas schaaf is probably unfireable unless the bottom totally drops out .
but if they fail to hammer cottbus , expect changes to the squad - with ageing captain frank baumann looking to be a prime candidate for replacement .
werder are five points adrift of a spot in the champions league .
there 's plenty of time left to close that gap , but a disappointing result against massive underdogs cottbus would have fans and management asking some unpleasant existential questions about whether this squad is still truly among the bundesliga 's elite . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the funding boost comes amid a surge of violence in the relatively quiet northern regions of afghanistan .
the german government hopes more aid money will make those areas more secure .

the german armed forces federation disagrees with that assessment .
following the death of a young german paratrooper at the end of august and the first civilian casualties at the hands of german soldiers a few days later , the federation 's chairman colonel bernhard gertz told reporters that the mission in afghanistan was nothing other than a " war against a fanatical enemy willing to do anything " .

the german armed forces federation disagrees with that assessment .
following the death of a young german paratrooper at the end of august and the first civilian casualties at the hands of german soldiers a few days later , the federation 's chairman colonel bernhard gertz told reporters that the mission in afghanistan was nothing other than a " war against a fanatical enemy willing to do anything " .

the week after the first break is traditionally when fans begin to get angry and coaches lose their jobs . the first few weeks of the season are like the initial ninety days of a new head of state 's term of office .
voters - or in the case of soccer , supporters - are willing to overlook fumbles and bumbles as part of the settling-in process .
but once the league emerges from its first break , club management and fans expect results .
and that puts serious pressure on the clubs who 've yet to chalk up a win .
hanover , in particular , will be feeling the heat .
touted by many observers in the pre-season as a possible top-five squad , they failed to score a goal in their first three matches and currently occupy the bottom spot in the table .
hanover coach dieter hecking has promised a turn-around this weekend against moenchengladbach .
but should he fail to get three points at home against a newly promoted opponent , his ears will be ringing with the one word all german coaches hate most - fehlstart .
more than just a bad beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus ' season has gotten off with a whimper fehlstart is , on the surface , just the german for bad beginning .
but in the culture of the bundesliga , it 's much more than that , something approaching an existential state of awfulness that can only be remedied with personnel changes .
and since the transfer window is closed , the only big move a club can make is firing the coach .
bojan prasnikar knows the score .
last september , he took over at energie cottbus after the small eastern german club had earned only two points from its first seven games .
now , he 's the one who 's having to answer endless fehlstart questions from baying-for-blood reporters , as cottbus has also failed to score and are tied at the bottom on one point .
but it 's unlikely prasnikar will be able to reverse energie 's fortunes straight away .
he 's going up this weekend against one of the bundesliga 's heavy hitters - and a team that 's fighting a fehlstart of its own .
quo vadis , werder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's schaaf wishes he could turn back time it 's no surprise to find the likes of bochum and bielefeld near the bottom and heading toward another season of merely battling for survival .
but werder bremen 's form has been shocking .
the side that usually plays the bundesliga 's most attractive football is off to its worst start in nine years , earning only a pair of draws and dropping five points to mediocre opposition .
having been at bremen 's helm for a decade , thomas schaaf is probably unfireable unless the bottom totally drops out .
but if they fail to hammer cottbus , expect changes to the squad - with ageing captain frank baumann looking to be a prime candidate for replacement .
werder are five points adrift of a spot in the champions league .
there 's plenty of time left to close that gap , but a disappointing result against massive underdogs cottbus would have fans and management asking some unpleasant existential questions about whether this squad is still truly among the bundesliga 's elite . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 09.09.2008 carbon capture plant opens in germany amid reservations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant in eastern germany , near the polish border is the only one of its kind in the world energy giant vattenfall has launched an emissions-free coal-fired test plant near berlin using a technology touted as a huge potential breakthrough in the fight against global warming .
but critics are n't convinced . swedish energy utility vattenfall sees carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- as a revolutionary answer to global warming which is largely blamed on carbon dioxide released when fossil fuels burn .
" this technology will become more important than offshore wind farms , " said vattenfall boss lars josefsson .
" our project at schwarze pumpe puts us at the forefront of this technology in the world , " said tuomo hatakka , the chief executive of vattenfall europe , referring to the the 70-million euro plant in eastern germany .
vattenfall , one of europe 's largest energy companies , hopes the project will help provide energy security through plentiful coal supplies while avoiding the co2 emissions that are blamed for global warming .
vattenfall underscores " clean technology " aspect a finnish-born executive who heads the swedish group 's berlin-based subsidiary , hatakka told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the process was viable because companies will have to buy eu allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ccs test plant has drawn prominent visitors including chancellor merkel " in tandem with eu-wide trading in emission rights , ccs will be economic .
at 30 to 35 euros per emission certificate , the technology breaks even , " he said .
the 30-megawatt pilot plant at schwarze pumpe in the lausitz region of eastern germany is very small compared to conventional power stations .
but it 's the first coal-fired power plant in the world ready to capture and store its own carbon dioxide emissions - a so-called ccs plant .
carbon dioxide emitted when lignite coal burns will not be vented up a chimney but piped away , compressed to a liquid and pumped into deep , porous rock .
the concentrated carbon dioxide will then be injected " for permanent storage " in a gas field in northern germany .
vattenfall plans to build two " demonstration plants " 10 times that size in germany and denmark by 2015 at the latest .
hatakka said the company aimed to commission its first " large-scale ccs power station " in 2020 .
the outcome of this new plant will be heat , water vapor , nine tons of co2 per hour and a milestone in clean energy technology , according to markus füller , a spokesman for vattenfall .
“ this process is necessary if we ever hope to continue using soft , lignite coal , he says .
we need to get a handle on the co2 problem , and we think this technology is the way to do it , " füller said .
critics are n't convinced but environmentalists say the technology uses far more energy than existing power generation and warn that there are no secure long-term storage facilities for the gas .
german conservation group bund on monday denounced the project as simply a cover allowing vattenfall to expand its network of conventional coal-fired power stations in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say the focus should be on expanding cheaper renewable energy rather than on polluting coal thorben becker of bund said it was still uncertain if ccs worked on a large scale .
ccs power stations would obtain 10 per cent less power from the coal than conventional plants did , and it was not clear if there were enough suitable sites to dump the co2 .
" instead of concentrating on far cheaper renewable energy , vattenfall is locking itself in for decades to converting climate-damaging brown coal into electricity , " he said .
the european union wants to have 10 or 12 full-scale ccs power stations within the next few years , but it is not clear who will pay the high costs of building and running the plants . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there were several countries that put critical questions to india , but also the united states , about how this arrangement is compatible with the common goal of nuclear non-proliferation , " ploetner told a news conference on monday , sept 8 .
" it is not an ideal solution .
the negotiations were very difficult and we can not say that we could not have imagined something better . "
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- is a group of 45 states that control the international sale of nuclear technology .
the deal with india is a key step in sealing the india-us atomic technology accord signed by us president george w. bush and indian premier manmohan singh in 2005 .
the us-india business council , one of the champions of the pact between new delhi and washington , said the nsg 's decision could unlock nuclear energy investment in india worth more than $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- .
the controversial agreement , signed on saturday , sept .
6 , means germany and other states can start jostling for a strong position in the race to sell nuclear know-how and technology to india .
a controversial decision the us had been hoping for a quick decision on the embargo , so that the current us congress could ratify the accord before elections in november .
us lawmakers are pushing for a vote by the end of september .
the decision to lift the embargo was controversial , in part because india - which was embargoed in the first place after it developed and tested nuclear weapons test in 1974 - has so far refused to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and singh signed a nukes deal in 2005 the us exerted the most pressure on the nsg to lift the embargo .
it argues that cooperation in the civilian nuclear sector could bring india closer to signing on to the international nuclear non proliferation treaty , and that an increase in atomic energy sources will help in the fight against global warming .
but critics - such as austria , ireland and new zealand , supported by china - warned that india is being rewarded for its long-time insistence on a right to nuclear technology ; they fear india could use atomic technology for military ends .
moreover , the nsg stance undermines its negotiating power when it comes to dealing with states such as iran and pakistan , opponents argue .
germany shows grudging acceptance the last nsg member state to finally agree to lift the india embargo was austria .
it signed only after india formally decreed it would adhere to a moratorium on further atomic-bomb tests .
germany , which currently chairs the nsg , expressed grudging acceptance of the landmark atomic energy deal .
it , too , denied the accord undermines the west 's efforts to convince iran to stop sensitive nuclear work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's ahmadinejad wants to expand his program asked whether the pact contradicted the west 's united opposition to iran 's controversial nuclear program , ploetner told afp news service that the nuclear suppliers group had underscored the goal of non-proliferation with the agreement .
germany : iaea approval was key " does this agreement send an approving message to iran ?
no , it absolutely does not , " ploetner said , calling india a " special case . "
ploetner added that the approval of the united nations ' nuclear watchdog , the vienna-based international atomic energy agency , had been decisive in winning approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting the iaea to sign on was a key part of the deal germany is among six countries working to convince tehran to abandon uranium enrichment , which the west fears is a pretense for building an iranian nuclear weapon .
iran says its nuclear program is for civilian purposes only .
jostling for contracts has begun meanwhile , the us forecasts that india 's growing energy needs mean it will have to build at least eight new atomic energy plants by 2012 .
britain , france and russia have already joined the us in jostling for lucrative contracts .
and during the celebration of the 50th anniversary of a german-supported technical university earlier this week in chennai , india , german technology minister annette schavan was warmly greeted by her indian counterpart kipal sibal .
" we have to see the next 50 years of cooperation in the light of the events of this past weekend , " sibal said at the celebration .
in cooperation with germany , india could find out " which components and what know-how is important for us , " he added bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has a strong footing in atomic energy while the nsg decision means india is now technically free to trade on the world market , indian leaders said late monday , sept .
8 , they would seek to clinch international nuclear deals only after the india-us atomic agreement is cleared by the us congress .
on tuesday , sept .
9 , the white house said it was " hopeful " congress would pass the landmark cooperation deal before president bush 's term ends in january . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a berlin newspaper quoted a spokesman for the federal office of information matthias gaertner at the weekend saying that the chrome browser " should not be used for general use . "
since then there have been reports that the federal office for information security has issued an official warning against using the new google browser .
but on monday sep .
8 gaertner told the ap news agency that his comments had been taken out of context .
security experts are concerned the chrome browser uses a number for each user that is set up during installation and then communicated to a central server every time the product is in use for the purpose of collecting usage statistics such as details of program crashes .
critics are concerned that the number could be used to identify users .
google rejects security concerns but kay oberbeck , speaking for google , told the dpa news agency : " there are no connections made between the installation number and the entries in the search box or address box . "
the system of attributing a number to each user is not particular to this new google product .
mozilla , the browser of the non-commercial firefox brand , also sends a user number the software company 's server .
another concern about the product is that it collects data from users for use in functions such as the " omnibox " which remembers the topics of previous searches and suggests possible search topics .
google confirms that it saves two percent of data , including users ip addresses .
" this data is necessary to generate the completed search suggestions , " oberbeck explained .
oberbeck also stressed that user information is gathered in a way that makes the users anonymous , and he said that the function can be turned off simply .
critics have also said that , in releasing a test version of the product , google has given users a false sense of security .
" google should have clearly told its users that this is a beta version meant for testing , " daniel bachfeld of the german " c 't " computer magazine told dpa news agency .
spokesman for google germany stefan keuchel said that the beta version was released because it allows for more flexibility in finding bugs , fixing glitches and addressing feedback from users . dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

like-for-like sales in august were 1 % lower than a year before , the brc said .
damp weather followed the failure of retailers in july to attract shoppers through the use of heavy discounts .
food and drink was the only sector to show significant sales growth , despite the chilly weather hitting salad and barbecue products .
food retailers reported higher sales of cheaper meat products such as mince and stewing meats .
heavy discounts in a bid to attract consumers who have been tightening belts in the face of rising inflation there was heavy discounting across both clothing and footwear stores over the month .
sales of diy and gardening equipment slowed , while " big-ticket " furniture sales showed year-on-year falls for the seventh month in a row .
between june and august , like-for-like sales were 0.8 % lower than the same three-month period a year earlier .
the findings come a week after the cbi 's latest distributive trade survey said retailers had endured a " summer to forget " .
last month the brc urged the chancellor to reinstate business tax relief on empty properties in his 2009 budget .
it also asked for other measures to revive spending , including zero tax for environmentally friendly goods .
brc director stephen robertson said : " prospects for customers and retailers are inextricably linked .
helping retailers keep prices down by cutting regulatory costs is the best way the government can assist hard-pressed customers . "
helen dickinson , head of retail at financial services group kpmg , added : " the only good news is that the results do not show a significant and further deterioration of the trend over the previous few months , but there is no doubt august was another disappointing month for uk retail . "

uk housebuilder redrow saw its annual profits almost halve as it battled " unprecedented market conditions " .
the flintshire-based firm reported pre-tax profits of £ 65.5m in the year to 30 june , while revenue dropped 22 % to £ 650m during the period .
redrow cut the value of its land bank by £ 260m and warned that the squeeze on mortgages could continue until 2010 .
but it said it had secured access to an extra £ 450m of debt as it tried to cope with the gloomy conditions .
downturn the access to the new debt would help it manage the business " through these exceptional markets " , it said .
" the severity and speed of the deterioration of the housing market in 2008 will impact on short term profitability , " redrow said .
the firm 's chairman , alan bowker , called on the government to act to boost the availability of mortgages to try to stimulate the housing market .
" it is our view that there may be no meaningful increase in the availability of finance in the wider mortgage market before 2010 , " he said .
the slowing demand for new homes has dented the value of land .
the firm said that that when this write-down was taken into account , it had seen an annual loss of £ 193.9m.
as part of the downturn in the sector , thousands of uk construction jobs have been lost in recent months .

the us star took fans at birmingham 's national indoor arena on a two-hour journey through almost 50 years of songs that helped shape soul and pop .
a sold out crowd of 13,500 saw him play with a 10-strong band and four backing singers , including his daughter aisha .
wonder , 58 , now visits manchester and london before other european cities .
with a musical catalogue that few can match , wonder took a couple of detours but made sure his biggest hits were in the bag .
breathless medley they ranged from 1960s motown standards like uptight through the groundbreaking 1970s funk of superstition to his 1980s pop smash i just called to say i love you .
wonder 's mid- ' 70s albums will go down as his masterpieces , and he saved their highlights until last .
superstition merged into sir duke , which segued into i wish before the finale of as - a breathless medley that left the crowd on a high .
but with time running out , the most anticipated songs were also the most rushed .
dressed all in black , with a growing girth and receding hair , it is now 45 years since wonder had his first hit as the 12-year-old genius , and 23 since he last reached the top of the charts .
but the massive cheer that greeted wonder at the start of the night confirmed his status as one of pop 's sacred stars .
for the first tune , he reached for the harmonica , coaxing intricate nuances as easily as if it were a grand piano .
his other instruments - and that includes his voice - were played the same way , with sincere , soulful expression , warm passion and jazzy improvisation .
bizarre turn his vocal cords and his fingers are in fine condition , and he is one of the most irrepressibly enthusiastic men in pop , brimming with infectious energy .
that was summed up as he sat at his keyboard , with his head up , body swaying and mouth in a wide open grin .
he led lots of audience participation , getting the crowd to chant or sing lines , and told us how much he loved us several times , thanking us for everything we had done for him .
he also revealed how the death of lost his mother in 2006 inspired him to go back on the road after so long . "
i just called to say i love you was a little understated , apologetic even , but nothing was going to stop the crowd singing and swaying along " " i want to take all the pain that i feel and celebrate and turn it around , " he told us .
" what a blessing i 've had in this life to be able to go places i 've never imagined , and meet so many wonderful people , people like yourselves . "
but his exuberance did get slightly out of hand .
the funky interludes and jams dragged and his monologues had a habit of turning into rambles .
at one point , he launched into a speech about the people who have had visions to bring people together " through all the craziness " , about " unity and peace and oneness " , and the 200th anniversary of the birth of louis braille .
then things took a turn for the bizarre with an appearance by hull city footballer george boateng .
he presented wonder with a statue of arthur wharton , the uk 's first black professional footballer , and in return the singer added his voice to the campaign for wharton to be more widely recognised .
but during the second half of the show , proceedings got back on track and the hits came thick and fast .
living for the city was followed by signed , sealed , delivered and uptight , and the 13,500-strong chorus was in fine voice for my cherie amour and for once in my life .
i just called to say i love you was a little understated , apologetic even , but nothing was going to stop the crowd singing and swaying along .
they were more reluctant to join his chants of barack obama 's name , though , as wonder launched into superstition and the finale .
those last songs summed up wonder 's greatest achievements , weaving a vibrant tapestry of melodic adventure , dynamic arrangements , bubbling soul and indefatigable spirit .

breathless medley they ranged from 1960s motown standards like uptight through the groundbreaking 1970s funk of superstition to his 1980s pop smash i just called to say i love you .
wonder 's mid- ' 70s albums will go down as his masterpieces , and he saved their highlights until last .
wonder performed alongside his daughter aisha superstition merged into sir duke , which segued into i wish before the finale of as - a breathless medley that left the crowd on a high .
but with time running out , the most anticipated songs were also the most rushed .
dressed all in black , with a growing girth and receding hair , it is now 45 years since wonder had his first hit as the 12-year-old genius , and 23 since he last reached the top of the charts .
but the massive cheer that greeted wonder at the start of the night confirmed his status as one of pop 's sacred stars .
for the first tune , he reached for the harmonica , coaxing intricate nuances as easily as if it were a grand piano .
his other instruments - and that includes his voice - were played the same way , with sincere , soulful expression , warm passion and jazzy improvisation .
bizarre turn his vocal cords and his fingers are in fine condition , and he is one of the most irrepressibly enthusiastic men in pop , brimming with infectious energy .
that was summed up as he sat at his keyboard , with his head up , body swaying and mouth in a wide open grin .
he led lots of audience participation , getting the crowd to chant or sing lines , and told us how much he loved us several times , thanking us for everything we had done for him .
he also revealed how the death of lost his mother in 2006 inspired him to go back on the road after so long .
i just called to say i love you was a little understated , apologetic even , but nothing was going to stop the crowd singing and swaying along " i want to take all the pain that i feel and celebrate and turn it around , " he told us .
" what a blessing i 've had in this life to be able to go places i 've never imagined , and meet so many wonderful people , people like yourselves . "
but his exuberance did get slightly out of hand .
the funky interludes and jams dragged and his monologues had a habit of turning into rambles .
at one point , he launched into a speech about the people who have had visions to bring people together " through all the craziness " , about " unity and peace and oneness " , and the 200th anniversary of the birth of louis braille .
then things took a turn for the bizarre with an appearance by hull city footballer george boateng .
he presented wonder with a statue of arthur wharton , the uk 's first black professional footballer , and in return the singer added his voice to the campaign for wharton to be more widely recognised .
but during the second half of the show , proceedings got back on track and the hits came thick and fast .
living for the city was followed by signed , sealed , delivered and uptight , and the 13,500-strong chorus was in fine voice for my cherie amour and for once in my life .
i just called to say i love you was a little understated , apologetic even , but nothing was going to stop the crowd singing and swaying along .
they were more reluctant to join his chants of barack obama 's name , though , as wonder launched into superstition and the finale .
those last songs summed up wonder 's greatest achievements , weaving a vibrant tapestry of melodic adventure , dynamic arrangements , bubbling soul and indefatigable spirit .

the us star took fans at birmingham 's national indoor arena on a two-hour journey through almost 50 years of songs that helped shape soul and pop .
a sold out crowd of 13,500 saw him play with a 10-strong band and four backing singers , including his daughter aisha .
wonder , 58 , now visits manchester and london before other european cities .
with a musical catalogue that few can match , wonder took a couple of detours but made sure his biggest hits were in the bag .
breathless medley they ranged from 1960s motown standards like uptight through the groundbreaking 1970s funk of superstition to his 1980s pop smash i just called to say i love you .
wonder 's mid- ' 70s albums will go down as his masterpieces , and he saved their highlights until last .
wonder performed alongside his daughter aisha superstition merged into sir duke , which segued into i wish before the finale of as - a breathless medley that left the crowd on a high .
but with time running out , the most anticipated songs were also the most rushed .
dressed all in black , with a growing girth and receding hair , it is now 45 years since wonder had his first hit as the 12-year-old genius , and 23 since he last reached the top of the charts .
but the massive cheer that greeted wonder at the start of the night confirmed his status as one of pop 's sacred stars .
for the first tune , he reached for the harmonica , coaxing intricate nuances as easily as if it were a grand piano .
his other instruments - and that includes his voice - were played the same way , with sincere , soulful expression , warm passion and jazzy improvisation .
bizarre turn his vocal cords and his fingers are in fine condition , and he is one of the most irrepressibly enthusiastic men in pop , brimming with infectious energy .
that was summed up as he sat at his keyboard , with his head up , body swaying and mouth in a wide open grin .
he led lots of audience participation , getting the crowd to chant or sing lines , and told us how much he loved us several times , thanking us for everything we had done for him .
he also revealed how the death of lost his mother in 2006 inspired him to go back on the road after so long .
i just called to say i love you was a little understated , apologetic even , but nothing was going to stop the crowd singing and swaying along " i want to take all the pain that i feel and celebrate and turn it around , " he told us .
" what a blessing i 've had in this life to be able to go places i 've never imagined , and meet so many wonderful people , people like yourselves . "
but his exuberance did get slightly out of hand .
the funky interludes and jams dragged and his monologues had a habit of turning into rambles .
at one point , he launched into a speech about the people who have had visions to bring people together " through all the craziness " , about " unity and peace and oneness " , and the 200th anniversary of the birth of louis braille .
then things took a turn for the bizarre with an appearance by hull city footballer george boateng .
he presented wonder with a statue of arthur wharton , the uk 's first black professional footballer , and in return the singer added his voice to the campaign for wharton to be more widely recognised .
but during the second half of the show , proceedings got back on track and the hits came thick and fast .
living for the city was followed by signed , sealed , delivered and uptight , and the 13,500-strong chorus was in fine voice for my cherie amour and for once in my life .
i just called to say i love you was a little understated , apologetic even , but nothing was going to stop the crowd singing and swaying along .
they were more reluctant to join his chants of barack obama 's name , though , as wonder launched into superstition and the finale .
those last songs summed up wonder 's greatest achievements , weaving a vibrant tapestry of melodic adventure , dynamic arrangements , bubbling soul and indefatigable spirit .

2007 's disturbia , starring shia labeouf , is a murder mystery about a boy who spies on suspicious neighbours .
legal papers filed in manhattan federal court say the story of 1954 film rear window is " essentially the same " .
the estate of late film producer sheldon abend , who owned the rear window rights , is seeking damages .
the legal documents claim that disturbia copies both rear window and short story murder from a fixed viewpoint - written by author cornell woolrich in 1942 - which mr hitchcock 's film was based on .
the rights to both rear window and the short story were owned by mr woolrich , who died in 1968 .
they were subsequently sold to mr abend , who died in 2003 .
his estate claims that the main character in all three works behaves in the same way and interacts with similar characters .
" what the defendants have been unwilling to do openly , legitimately and legally , -lsb- they -rsb- have done surreptitiously by their back door use of the rear window story without paying compensation , " the legal papers add .
representatives for mr spielberg and dreamworks said they would not comment on pending cases .
