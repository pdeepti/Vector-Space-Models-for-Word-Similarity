" this is not a lot to pay , " said angel gurria , oecd head , in a 520-page environmental outlook presented in oslo , adding that this was similar to the cost of an insurance policy .
" the consequences and costs of inaction would be much higher , " said gurria .
unchecked environmental damage could mean four billion people would be without adequate water supplies by 2030 , and leave the world facing heat waves , droughts and floods by the end of the century .
mounting evidence in favor of green measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant pandas are among the species threatened by environmental destruction the study adds to evidence that curbing global warming is affordable .
last year , the un climate panel said that measures to tackle climate change would cost between 0.06 and 0.1 percent of world gross domestic product a year to 2030 .
the report focuses on several key areas including climate change , the reduction in biodiversity , water shortages , illegal logging and the impact of pollution and toxic chemicals on human health .
" if no new policy actions are taken , within the next few decades , we risk irreversibly altering the environmental basis for sustained economic prosperity , " the report said .
green taxes , emissions trading and polluter-pay systems were among suggested measures .
it also recommended revamping the most damaging industries , such as energy , transport , agriculture and fisheries .
norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg , whose country contributed funding for the report , said the study underlined the need to " find solutions where we are able to combine economic development with the environment . "
the report projected that inaction would lead to a rise in global greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 .
green package could cut emissions by over 20 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd is calling for an overhaul of the energy market the study suggested a hypothetical policy package , including a 50 percent cut in farm subsidies , a 16.50 euro -lrb- $ 25 -rrb- per tonne tax on emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide phased in by region , new biofuels , measures to cut air pollution and improved sewerage systems .
if this package were implemented , the study said emissions would be slashed to around 13 percent .
to combate climate change , the oecd said " developed countries will need to work closely with emerging economies - especially brazil , russia , india , indonesia , china and south africa . "
if nothing is done , greenhouse emissions from china , india , russia and brazil alone would " grow by 46 percent to 2030 , surpassing those of the 30 oecd countries combined , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is not a lot to pay , " said angel gurria , oecd head , in a 520-page environmental outlook presented in oslo , adding that this was similar to the cost of an insurance policy .
" the consequences and costs of inaction would be much higher , " said gurria .

last year , the un climate panel said that measures to tackle climate change would cost between 0.06 and 0.1 percent of world gross domestic product a year to 2030 .
the report focuses on several key areas including climate change , the reduction in biodiversity , water shortages , illegal logging and the impact of pollution and toxic chemicals on human health .
" if no new policy actions are taken , within the next few decades , we risk irreversibly altering the environmental basis for sustained economic prosperity , " the report said .
green taxes , emissions trading and polluter-pay systems were among suggested measures .
it also recommended revamping the most damaging industries , such as energy , transport , agriculture and fisheries .
norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg , whose country contributed funding for the report , said the study underlined the need to " find solutions where we are able to combine economic development with the environment . "
the report projected that inaction would lead to a rise in global greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 .

if this package were implemented , the study said emissions would be slashed to around 13 percent .
to combate climate change , the oecd said " developed countries will need to work closely with emerging economies - especially brazil , russia , india , indonesia , china and south africa . "
if nothing is done , greenhouse emissions from china , india , russia and brazil alone would " grow by 46 percent to 2030 , surpassing those of the 30 oecd countries combined , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but her main opponents want her to consider a grand coalition . six weeks after inconclusive elections in the western state , hesse 's social democratic part -lrb- spd -rrb- leader , andrea ypsilanti , said her preferred combination of the spd , the greens and the liberal fdp had foundered on opposition from the fdp . the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , said it wanted to engage in talks with ypsilanti over a grand coalition , similar to the national power-sharing agreement , according to cdu state parliamentary leader christean wagner . he told broadcaster deutschlandfunk on wednesday , march 5 , a grand coalition would be the only way to keep the left party from increasing its influence . ypsilanti , who positions herself on the left wing of the spd , indicated on tuesday , she would accept being voted into office as premier with the help of the six left party members of the new legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti wants to form a government with the left she acknowledged that this was in conflict with her pre-election position . " it could happen that i can not stick to an election promise , " she said .
" believe me , this is not easy for me . " the german public is divided on whether the spd and cdu should cooperate with the left , according to a forsa study published in german news weekly stern . some 52 percent of germans said they were against parties associating with left while 42 percent said they could imagine such a tie-up . ypsilanti and spd national head kurt beck pledged ahead of the jan .

both parties have 42 seats in the 110-seat legislature . the free-market liberal fdp , normally the cdu 's ideal coalition partner , has 11 seats , and the greens , the spd 's preferred partner , have nine .
the left , with six seats , holds the balance . the spd has previously avoided all contact in the western states with the left , which many germans see as a party of unreconstructed communists in the east and fringe leftists in the west . in the eastern states , where the left is the largest party with estimated support of around 30 percent , the spd has entered into a coalition with the party in the city-state of berlin . concessions to left risk political spilt the opening up to the left , initiated late last month by beck , has caused a rift in the party , germany 's oldest political formation with strong links to the trade union movement . merkel and other cdu leaders have openly accused beck and ypsilanti of breaking their pre-election promises . ypsilanti aims to have herself elected premier by the state legislature with the party 's support in a secret ballot on april 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi is willing to give the spd the votes they need left party leader in the federal parliament , gregor gysi , pledged the full support of the party for ypsilanti in the vote . " i give her a guarantee for the six votes that she needs , " he said . but observers did not rule out the possibility that spd members opposed to the deal might use the secrecy of the ballot to scupper ypsilanti 's plans by abstaining . ypsilanti said tuesday she would seek shifting majorities with the fdp and the cdu to push through educational reforms and an energy policy based on renewable resources for the state , which includes the financial centre of frankfurt . analysts believe she could seek an early election after making her policy aims clear . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.03.2008 german orchestra takes richard wagner to abu dhabi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatskapelle is temporarily leaving the stately semperoper the new york philharmonic is hardly the only orchestra to have visited a " hostile " country .
dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?

dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?

the 27-member bloc urged the serbian government on wednesday , mar .
5 , to make it clear it saw the country 's future with europe ahead of the parliamentary vote .
" we ask the serbian government to reaffirm its commitment to closer ties with the eu .
we are ready to move on once serbia is ready to do the same , " said eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
he also announced proposals for eventual phasing out of eu visa requirements , doubling scholarships to the bloc and boosting transport links .
the serb parliamentary draft calls for serbia to give up its ambitions to join the eu unless its member states annul their recognition of kosovo 's independence .
serb nationalists warn the eu over kosovo " we , the representatives of the people of serbia warn the eu that only a whole , not a fragmented serbi can and wants to negotiate on european integration , " it states .

the german government agreed on wednesday to send 180 police officers to the newly independent state as part of the eulex mission , which is regarded as illegal by many in serbia .
the resolution , which was submitted by the nationalist radical party on tuesday , is backed by the party of prime minister vojislav kostunica and by the socialists of late president slobodan milosevic .
they hold 144 of the assembly 's 250 seats .
the pro-western democratic party of serbia 's president boris tadic opposes the move .
serbia has initialled a pre-membership stabilization and association agreement , but the eu has blocked the signing of the accord until belgrade delivers remaining war crimes suspects from the yugoslav wars of the 1990s to the hague tribunal .

a german construction worker kidnapped in nigeria on tuesday , mar .
4 , has been released unharmed - just 12 hours after he was seized .
but it was the first foreign hostagetaking in the area for several months . " he was released at 11pm .
no ransom was paid , " a source at the hostage 's employers , julius berger , told reuters news agency .
details of the abduction remain sketchy , but unknown gunmen killed at least one military escort during the kidnapping near emuoha in the niger delta .
and there are conflicting reports about the fate of the foreign worker 's driver . the german-nigerian construction company julius berger is currently upgrading the road there , which leads out of port harcourt , the area 's main city . is the threat to foreign workers growing again ?

it is unclear whether tuesday 's abduction was an isolated incident or signals a return to more unsettled times for expatriates .
over 200 foreign workers have been kidnapped by militants and ransom seekers since 2006 .
nearly all of them were released unharmed .

but kidnapping is also big business in the area , and it is not just restricted to foreign workers .

" this is not a lot to pay , " said angel gurria , oecd head , in a 520-page environmental outlook presented in oslo , adding that this was similar to the cost of an insurance policy .
" the consequences and costs of inaction would be much higher , " said gurria .
unchecked environmental damage could mean four billion people would be without adequate water supplies by 2030 , and leave the world facing heat waves , droughts and floods by the end of the century .
mounting evidence in favor of green measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant pandas are among the species threatened by environmental destruction the study adds to evidence that curbing global warming is affordable .
last year , the un climate panel said that measures to tackle climate change would cost between 0.06 and 0.1 percent of world gross domestic product a year to 2030 .
the report focuses on several key areas including climate change , the reduction in biodiversity , water shortages , illegal logging and the impact of pollution and toxic chemicals on human health .
" if no new policy actions are taken , within the next few decades , we risk irreversibly altering the environmental basis for sustained economic prosperity , " the report said .
green taxes , emissions trading and polluter-pay systems were among suggested measures .
it also recommended revamping the most damaging industries , such as energy , transport , agriculture and fisheries .
norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg , whose country contributed funding for the report , said the study underlined the need to " find solutions where we are able to combine economic development with the environment . "
the report projected that inaction would lead to a rise in global greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 .
green package could cut emissions by over 20 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd is calling for an overhaul of the energy market the study suggested a hypothetical policy package , including a 50 percent cut in farm subsidies , a 16.50 euro -lrb- $ 25 -rrb- per tonne tax on emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide phased in by region , new biofuels , measures to cut air pollution and improved sewerage systems .
if this package were implemented , the study said emissions would be slashed to around 13 percent .
to combate climate change , the oecd said " developed countries will need to work closely with emerging economies - especially brazil , russia , india , indonesia , china and south africa . "
if nothing is done , greenhouse emissions from china , india , russia and brazil alone would " grow by 46 percent to 2030 , surpassing those of the 30 oecd countries combined , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the left , with six seats , holds the balance . the spd has previously avoided all contact in the western states with the left , which many germans see as a party of unreconstructed communists in the east and fringe leftists in the west . in the eastern states , where the left is the largest party with estimated support of around 30 percent , the spd has entered into a coalition with the party in the city-state of berlin . concessions to left risk political spilt the opening up to the left , initiated late last month by beck , has caused a rift in the party , germany 's oldest political formation with strong links to the trade union movement . merkel and other cdu leaders have openly accused beck and ypsilanti of breaking their pre-election promises . ypsilanti aims to have herself elected premier by the state legislature with the party 's support in a secret ballot on april 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi is willing to give the spd the votes they need left party leader in the federal parliament , gregor gysi , pledged the full support of the party for ypsilanti in the vote .

dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .
that 's their very ambitious goal .
so you plan on continuing to work in abu dhabi ?
that will depend on whether the concert is as successful as we think and hope it will be .
our goal is to leave a lasting impression so that people are exciting about experiencing classical music .
after that , we 'll see .
but there 's no reason , after the opera house there is completed , why we could n't stage the first complete cycle of wagner 's ring operas in the arab world . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .
that 's their very ambitious goal .
so you plan on continuing to work in abu dhabi ?
that will depend on whether the concert is as successful as we think and hope it will be .
our goal is to leave a lasting impression so that people are exciting about experiencing classical music .
after that , we 'll see .
but there 's no reason , after the opera house there is completed , why we could n't stage the first complete cycle of wagner 's ring operas in the arab world . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .
that 's their very ambitious goal .
so you plan on continuing to work in abu dhabi ?
that will depend on whether the concert is as successful as we think and hope it will be .
our goal is to leave a lasting impression so that people are exciting about experiencing classical music .
after that , we 'll see .
but there 's no reason , after the opera house there is completed , why we could n't stage the first complete cycle of wagner 's ring operas in the arab world . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany gripped by us primaries drama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is a well-known name in germany , obama has wowed many with his charisma barack obama 's popularity has soared in germany in recent weeks with many comparing him to president john f. kennedy .
but experts say clinton , who has revived her campaign , is well-liked across the atlantic too . barack obama has been a fixture in the german media for a while now , hogging the headlines and gracing the covers of major publications . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama : the " messiah " factor ?
leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even went so far as to address his popularity in biblical terms , featuring him on their feb .
11 cover with the title " the messiah factor : barack obama and the yearning for a new america . " a recent poll by the london-based financial times found that obama is the people 's number one choice in germany , italy , france and spain . clinton not written off yet despite the intense coverage of obama in the german press , which has frequently compared him to president john f. kennedy , - most remembered in germany for the support he gave berlin when the wall was built during his presidency in 1961 - experts point out that obama 's challenger , hillary clinton , remains well-liked and respected by many germans too . " until mid-january , there was more sympathy for hillary clinton , " christoph von marschall , washington correspondent for the berlin-based tagesspiegel newspaper and author of the book " der schwarze kennedy -lrb- the black kennedy -rrb- , a biography about obama , told dw-world.de. " far more people knew clinton , and ' clinton ' is a good name in germany and europe ; it 's not linked to all the scandals like it is in the us , " he said . " it 's connected with a peaceful and successful time in international politics and also a time of relative harmony in trans-atlantic relations , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton took important states texas and ohio clinton has climbed up the popularity stakes , energizing her campaign after winning key primaries in texas , ohio and rhode island . media around the world have hailed clinton 's tuesday victories as a " comeback , " but the race with barack obama for the democratic nomination remains neck-and-neck after his long stretch of winning primaries in 11 other states .
while the decision about the nomination could ultimately be left to the superdelegates , right now , obama remains ahead in terms of popular votes . message of change resonates with germans in germany , obama 's popularity has much to do with the fact that the young senator from illinois represents a change from the present government and policies in america , some say . " many germans , like americans , want to see change in america , and barack obama stands for that , " alexander höse , a lecturer of german-american relations at the university of cologne , told dw-radio . writing in the respected weekly newspaper , die zeit , martin klingst echoed von marschall 's thesis that obama personifies the american dream . " by way of his own will and determination , he has worked his way up through the ranks and has still remained human along the way , " klingst wrote in a review of von marschall 's book . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton -lrb- r -rrb- has complained that american journalists are tough on her " he thinks beyond party boundaries and he seems to revive the vision of a modern , post-racist society in which anyone can become president , regardless of their origins , their skin color or their gender , " he continued . with a father as a kenyan exchange student and a white mother originally from kansas , obama 's is also a classic rags-to-riches story : a young , african-american man from a lower middle-class family who becomes a respected lawyer and senator . " after all the years of america-bashing and bush-bashing around the world , americans have the opportunity to like themselves more because the dream of the country seems to work again , " von marschall said . and the " charisma factor " can not be underestimated among germans either . " since she entered public life in the us , hillary clinton has always had a problem appearing as friendly and nice to the media , " von marschall said .
" she has difficulties opening up , while obama seems open-hearted . " sitting on the fence yet thomas lückerath , editor-in-chief of dwdl.de , an internet news magazine that covers the german media industry , agreed with von marschall that clinton 's appeal could not be underestimated in germany either . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the nomination be about race -lrb- or gender -rrb- ?
" i do n't think the german media have already made a decision for obama , especially if you look at the question of whether a woman or a black man should become president , " he said .
" if you look at chancellor merkel , you see that the issue of a woman running the country is also on people 's minds . " he pointed out that " both have strong personalities and both have interesting personal backgrounds . " generally , electing an american president about is not about differences in policy , von marschall said . " it 's about whether a person appeals to citizens , whether the public thinks ' that 's a nice guy or woman ' i can have in my living room on the news every day for the next four years . " still , the journalist has words of caution when it comes to obama . " he is creating so many expectations that he will not be able to meet them - it would be more than what is humanly possible .

leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even went so far as to address his popularity in biblical terms , featuring him on their feb .
11 cover with the title " the messiah factor : barack obama and the yearning for a new america . " a recent poll by the london-based financial times found that obama is the people 's number one choice in germany , italy , france and spain . clinton not written off yet despite the intense coverage of obama in the german press , which has frequently compared him to president john f. kennedy , - most remembered in germany for the support he gave berlin when the wall was built during his presidency in 1961 - experts point out that obama 's challenger , hillary clinton , remains well-liked and respected by many germans too .

germany 's federal cartel office has launched a probe of 35 natural gas suppliers suspected of charging excessively high prices . german authorities had noted price differences that ranged from 25 percent to 45 percent , the office said in a statement on wednesday , march 5 . the cartel office would therefore check whether recent german gas price hikes were justified , it added . " horribly weak " competition office head bernhard heitzer said preliminary results of the probe suggested that competition was " still horribly weak " in the gas sector . " from what we know now , an entire series of companies have raised gas prices to a level that they could never demand in a functioning , competitive economy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as much as 20 percent of the german market stands to be affected by the probe the price increases concerned four million clients and around 20 percent of the market , the office said . a spokesman contacted by the afp news service declined to provide the names of companies under investigation , saying only that national and regional firms were concerned . in all , 770 companies supply gas to households and companies in germany , of which around 30 are active throughout the country . some do n't pass on savings regional anti-cartel offices had also launched their own investigations into gas price increases . heitzer said a number of companies were raising gas prices in a way that would be impossible to do in a normal competitive situation . " even in places where the network fees are low , that price advantage is n't necessarily passed on to clients ; the savings appear to be used to boost the company 's value in another area , " heitzer added . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de political parties -pipe- 05.03.2008 germany 's social democrats consider left party deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite assurances that it would not consider working with the left , the spd could change tack the leader of the social democrats in the state of hesse signaled a significant shift in german politics by saying she would hold talks with the left party .
but her main opponents want her to consider a grand coalition . six weeks after inconclusive elections in the western state , hesse 's social democratic part -lrb- spd -rrb- leader , andrea ypsilanti , said her preferred combination of the spd , the greens and the liberal fdp had foundered on opposition from the fdp . the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , said it wanted to engage in talks with ypsilanti over a grand coalition , similar to the national power-sharing agreement , according to cdu state parliamentary leader christean wagner . he told broadcaster deutschlandfunk on wednesday , march 5 , a grand coalition would be the only way to keep the left party from increasing its influence . ypsilanti , who positions herself on the left wing of the spd , indicated on tuesday , she would accept being voted into office as premier with the help of the six left party members of the new legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti wants to form a government with the left she acknowledged that this was in conflict with her pre-election position . " it could happen that i can not stick to an election promise , " she said .
" believe me , this is not easy for me . " the german public is divided on whether the spd and cdu should cooperate with the left , according to a forsa study published in german news weekly stern . some 52 percent of germans said they were against parties associating with left while 42 percent said they could imagine such a tie-up . ypsilanti and spd national head kurt beck pledged ahead of the jan .
27 poll that they would not enter into any agreement with the left , a party that draws most of its support from left-wing spd breakaways and in the formerly communist eastern states . left a key player in coalition deals the spd emerged from the elections with 36.7 percent of the vote , behind chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats on 36.8 percent .
both parties have 42 seats in the 110-seat legislature . the free-market liberal fdp , normally the cdu 's ideal coalition partner , has 11 seats , and the greens , the spd 's preferred partner , have nine .
the left , with six seats , holds the balance . the spd has previously avoided all contact in the western states with the left , which many germans see as a party of unreconstructed communists in the east and fringe leftists in the west . in the eastern states , where the left is the largest party with estimated support of around 30 percent , the spd has entered into a coalition with the party in the city-state of berlin . concessions to left risk political spilt the opening up to the left , initiated late last month by beck , has caused a rift in the party , germany 's oldest political formation with strong links to the trade union movement . merkel and other cdu leaders have openly accused beck and ypsilanti of breaking their pre-election promises . ypsilanti aims to have herself elected premier by the state legislature with the party 's support in a secret ballot on april 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi is willing to give the spd the votes they need left party leader in the federal parliament , gregor gysi , pledged the full support of the party for ypsilanti in the vote . " i give her a guarantee for the six votes that she needs , " he said . but observers did not rule out the possibility that spd members opposed to the deal might use the secrecy of the ballot to scupper ypsilanti 's plans by abstaining . ypsilanti said tuesday she would seek shifting majorities with the fdp and the cdu to push through educational reforms and an energy policy based on renewable resources for the state , which includes the financial centre of frankfurt . analysts believe she could seek an early election after making her policy aims clear . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say clinton , who has revived her campaign , is well-liked across the atlantic too . barack obama has been a fixture in the german media for a while now , hogging the headlines and gracing the covers of major publications . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama : the " messiah " factor ?
leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even went so far as to address his popularity in biblical terms , featuring him on their feb .
11 cover with the title " the messiah factor : barack obama and the yearning for a new america . " a recent poll by the london-based financial times found that obama is the people 's number one choice in germany , italy , france and spain . clinton not written off yet despite the intense coverage of obama in the german press , which has frequently compared him to president john f. kennedy , - most remembered in germany for the support he gave berlin when the wall was built during his presidency in 1961 - experts point out that obama 's challenger , hillary clinton , remains well-liked and respected by many germans too . " until mid-january , there was more sympathy for hillary clinton , " christoph von marschall , washington correspondent for the berlin-based tagesspiegel newspaper and author of the book " der schwarze kennedy -lrb- the black kennedy -rrb- , a biography about obama , told dw-world.de. " far more people knew clinton , and ' clinton ' is a good name in germany and europe ; it 's not linked to all the scandals like it is in the us , " he said .

while the decision about the nomination could ultimately be left to the superdelegates , right now , obama remains ahead in terms of popular votes . message of change resonates with germans in germany , obama 's popularity has much to do with the fact that the young senator from illinois represents a change from the present government and policies in america , some say . " many germans , like americans , want to see change in america , and barack obama stands for that , " alexander höse , a lecturer of german-american relations at the university of cologne , told dw-radio . writing in the respected weekly newspaper , die zeit , martin klingst echoed von marschall 's thesis that obama personifies the american dream . " by way of his own will and determination , he has worked his way up through the ranks and has still remained human along the way , " klingst wrote in a review of von marschall 's book . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton -lrb- r -rrb- has complained that american journalists are tough on her " he thinks beyond party boundaries and he seems to revive the vision of a modern , post-racist society in which anyone can become president , regardless of their origins , their skin color or their gender , " he continued . with a father as a kenyan exchange student and a white mother originally from kansas , obama 's is also a classic rags-to-riches story : a young , african-american man from a lower middle-class family who becomes a respected lawyer and senator . " after all the years of america-bashing and bush-bashing around the world , americans have the opportunity to like themselves more because the dream of the country seems to work again , " von marschall said . and the " charisma factor " can not be underestimated among germans either . " since she entered public life in the us , hillary clinton has always had a problem appearing as friendly and nice to the media , " von marschall said .
" she has difficulties opening up , while obama seems open-hearted . " sitting on the fence yet thomas lückerath , editor-in-chief of dwdl.de , an internet news magazine that covers the german media industry , agreed with von marschall that clinton 's appeal could not be underestimated in germany either . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the nomination be about race -lrb- or gender -rrb- ?
" i do n't think the german media have already made a decision for obama , especially if you look at the question of whether a woman or a black man should become president , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.03.2008 german orchestra takes richard wagner to abu dhabi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatskapelle is temporarily leaving the stately semperoper the new york philharmonic is hardly the only orchestra to have visited a " hostile " country .
dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .
that 's their very ambitious goal .
so you plan on continuing to work in abu dhabi ?
that will depend on whether the concert is as successful as we think and hope it will be .

the 27-member bloc urged the serbian government on wednesday , mar .
5 , to make it clear it saw the country 's future with europe ahead of the parliamentary vote .
" we ask the serbian government to reaffirm its commitment to closer ties with the eu .
we are ready to move on once serbia is ready to do the same , " said eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
he also announced proposals for eventual phasing out of eu visa requirements , doubling scholarships to the bloc and boosting transport links .
the serb parliamentary draft calls for serbia to give up its ambitions to join the eu unless its member states annul their recognition of kosovo 's independence .
serb nationalists warn the eu over kosovo " we , the representatives of the people of serbia warn the eu that only a whole , not a fragmented serbi can and wants to negotiate on european integration , " it states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.03.2008 german orchestra takes richard wagner to abu dhabi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatskapelle is temporarily leaving the stately semperoper the new york philharmonic is hardly the only orchestra to have visited a " hostile " country .
dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .
that 's their very ambitious goal .
so you plan on continuing to work in abu dhabi ?
that will depend on whether the concert is as successful as we think and hope it will be .
our goal is to leave a lasting impression so that people are exciting about experiencing classical music .
after that , we 'll see .
but there 's no reason , after the opera house there is completed , why we could n't stage the first complete cycle of wagner 's ring operas in the arab world . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.03.2008 german orchestra takes richard wagner to abu dhabi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatskapelle is temporarily leaving the stately semperoper the new york philharmonic is hardly the only orchestra to have visited a " hostile " country .
dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .
that 's their very ambitious goal .
so you plan on continuing to work in abu dhabi ?
that will depend on whether the concert is as successful as we think and hope it will be .
our goal is to leave a lasting impression so that people are exciting about experiencing classical music .
after that , we 'll see .
but there 's no reason , after the opera house there is completed , why we could n't stage the first complete cycle of wagner 's ring operas in the arab world . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?

" this is not a lot to pay , " said angel gurria , oecd head , in a 520-page environmental outlook presented in oslo , adding that this was similar to the cost of an insurance policy .
" the consequences and costs of inaction would be much higher , " said gurria .
unchecked environmental damage could mean four billion people would be without adequate water supplies by 2030 , and leave the world facing heat waves , droughts and floods by the end of the century .
mounting evidence in favor of green measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant pandas are among the species threatened by environmental destruction the study adds to evidence that curbing global warming is affordable .
last year , the un climate panel said that measures to tackle climate change would cost between 0.06 and 0.1 percent of world gross domestic product a year to 2030 .
the report focuses on several key areas including climate change , the reduction in biodiversity , water shortages , illegal logging and the impact of pollution and toxic chemicals on human health .
" if no new policy actions are taken , within the next few decades , we risk irreversibly altering the environmental basis for sustained economic prosperity , " the report said .
green taxes , emissions trading and polluter-pay systems were among suggested measures .
it also recommended revamping the most damaging industries , such as energy , transport , agriculture and fisheries .
norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg , whose country contributed funding for the report , said the study underlined the need to " find solutions where we are able to combine economic development with the environment . "
the report projected that inaction would lead to a rise in global greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 .
green package could cut emissions by over 20 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd is calling for an overhaul of the energy market the study suggested a hypothetical policy package , including a 50 percent cut in farm subsidies , a 16.50 euro -lrb- $ 25 -rrb- per tonne tax on emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide phased in by region , new biofuels , measures to cut air pollution and improved sewerage systems .
if this package were implemented , the study said emissions would be slashed to around 13 percent .
to combate climate change , the oecd said " developed countries will need to work closely with emerging economies - especially brazil , russia , india , indonesia , china and south africa . "
if nothing is done , greenhouse emissions from china , india , russia and brazil alone would " grow by 46 percent to 2030 , surpassing those of the 30 oecd countries combined , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu cities commit to climate package , but challenges lay ahead fighting global warming can happen one city at a time .

germany 's federal cartel office has launched a probe of 35 natural gas suppliers suspected of charging excessively high prices . german authorities had noted price differences that ranged from 25 percent to 45 percent , the office said in a statement on wednesday , march 5 . the cartel office would therefore check whether recent german gas price hikes were justified , it added . " horribly weak " competition office head bernhard heitzer said preliminary results of the probe suggested that competition was " still horribly weak " in the gas sector . " from what we know now , an entire series of companies have raised gas prices to a level that they could never demand in a functioning , competitive economy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as much as 20 percent of the german market stands to be affected by the probe the price increases concerned four million clients and around 20 percent of the market , the office said . a spokesman contacted by the afp news service declined to provide the names of companies under investigation , saying only that national and regional firms were concerned . in all , 770 companies supply gas to households and companies in germany , of which around 30 are active throughout the country . some do n't pass on savings regional anti-cartel offices had also launched their own investigations into gas price increases . heitzer said a number of companies were raising gas prices in a way that would be impossible to do in a normal competitive situation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.03.2008 german orchestra takes richard wagner to abu dhabi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatskapelle is temporarily leaving the stately semperoper the new york philharmonic is hardly the only orchestra to have visited a " hostile " country .
dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .
that 's their very ambitious goal .
so you plan on continuing to work in abu dhabi ?
that will depend on whether the concert is as successful as we think and hope it will be .
our goal is to leave a lasting impression so that people are exciting about experiencing classical music .
after that , we 'll see .

dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .

but her main opponents want her to consider a grand coalition . six weeks after inconclusive elections in the western state , hesse 's social democratic part -lrb- spd -rrb- leader , andrea ypsilanti , said her preferred combination of the spd , the greens and the liberal fdp had foundered on opposition from the fdp . the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , said it wanted to engage in talks with ypsilanti over a grand coalition , similar to the national power-sharing agreement , according to cdu state parliamentary leader christean wagner . he told broadcaster deutschlandfunk on wednesday , march 5 , a grand coalition would be the only way to keep the left party from increasing its influence . ypsilanti , who positions herself on the left wing of the spd , indicated on tuesday , she would accept being voted into office as premier with the help of the six left party members of the new legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti wants to form a government with the left she acknowledged that this was in conflict with her pre-election position . " it could happen that i can not stick to an election promise , " she said .
" believe me , this is not easy for me . " the german public is divided on whether the spd and cdu should cooperate with the left , according to a forsa study published in german news weekly stern . some 52 percent of germans said they were against parties associating with left while 42 percent said they could imagine such a tie-up . ypsilanti and spd national head kurt beck pledged ahead of the jan .
27 poll that they would not enter into any agreement with the left , a party that draws most of its support from left-wing spd breakaways and in the formerly communist eastern states . left a key player in coalition deals the spd emerged from the elections with 36.7 percent of the vote , behind chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats on 36.8 percent .
both parties have 42 seats in the 110-seat legislature . the free-market liberal fdp , normally the cdu 's ideal coalition partner , has 11 seats , and the greens , the spd 's preferred partner , have nine .
the left , with six seats , holds the balance . the spd has previously avoided all contact in the western states with the left , which many germans see as a party of unreconstructed communists in the east and fringe leftists in the west . in the eastern states , where the left is the largest party with estimated support of around 30 percent , the spd has entered into a coalition with the party in the city-state of berlin . concessions to left risk political spilt the opening up to the left , initiated late last month by beck , has caused a rift in the party , germany 's oldest political formation with strong links to the trade union movement . merkel and other cdu leaders have openly accused beck and ypsilanti of breaking their pre-election promises . ypsilanti aims to have herself elected premier by the state legislature with the party 's support in a secret ballot on april 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi is willing to give the spd the votes they need left party leader in the federal parliament , gregor gysi , pledged the full support of the party for ypsilanti in the vote . " i give her a guarantee for the six votes that she needs , " he said . but observers did not rule out the possibility that spd members opposed to the deal might use the secrecy of the ballot to scupper ypsilanti 's plans by abstaining . ypsilanti said tuesday she would seek shifting majorities with the fdp and the cdu to push through educational reforms and an energy policy based on renewable resources for the state , which includes the financial centre of frankfurt . analysts believe she could seek an early election after making her policy aims clear . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.03.2008 german orchestra takes richard wagner to abu dhabi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatskapelle is temporarily leaving the stately semperoper the new york philharmonic is hardly the only orchestra to have visited a " hostile " country .
dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .

dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .
that 's their very ambitious goal .
so you plan on continuing to work in abu dhabi ?

germany 's federal cartel office has launched a probe of 35 natural gas suppliers suspected of charging excessively high prices . german authorities had noted price differences that ranged from 25 percent to 45 percent , the office said in a statement on wednesday , march 5 . the cartel office would therefore check whether recent german gas price hikes were justified , it added . " horribly weak " competition office head bernhard heitzer said preliminary results of the probe suggested that competition was " still horribly weak " in the gas sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.03.2008 german orchestra takes richard wagner to abu dhabi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatskapelle is temporarily leaving the stately semperoper the new york philharmonic is hardly the only orchestra to have visited a " hostile " country .
dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .

european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .
that 's their very ambitious goal .
so you plan on continuing to work in abu dhabi ?
that will depend on whether the concert is as successful as we think and hope it will be .
our goal is to leave a lasting impression so that people are exciting about experiencing classical music .

dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .

dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?

but her main opponents want her to consider a grand coalition . six weeks after inconclusive elections in the western state , hesse 's social democratic part -lrb- spd -rrb- leader , andrea ypsilanti , said her preferred combination of the spd , the greens and the liberal fdp had foundered on opposition from the fdp . the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , said it wanted to engage in talks with ypsilanti over a grand coalition , similar to the national power-sharing agreement , according to cdu state parliamentary leader christean wagner . he told broadcaster deutschlandfunk on wednesday , march 5 , a grand coalition would be the only way to keep the left party from increasing its influence . ypsilanti , who positions herself on the left wing of the spd , indicated on tuesday , she would accept being voted into office as premier with the help of the six left party members of the new legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti wants to form a government with the left she acknowledged that this was in conflict with her pre-election position . " it could happen that i can not stick to an election promise , " she said .
" believe me , this is not easy for me . " the german public is divided on whether the spd and cdu should cooperate with the left , according to a forsa study published in german news weekly stern . some 52 percent of germans said they were against parties associating with left while 42 percent said they could imagine such a tie-up . ypsilanti and spd national head kurt beck pledged ahead of the jan .
27 poll that they would not enter into any agreement with the left , a party that draws most of its support from left-wing spd breakaways and in the formerly communist eastern states . left a key player in coalition deals the spd emerged from the elections with 36.7 percent of the vote , behind chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats on 36.8 percent .
both parties have 42 seats in the 110-seat legislature . the free-market liberal fdp , normally the cdu 's ideal coalition partner , has 11 seats , and the greens , the spd 's preferred partner , have nine .
the left , with six seats , holds the balance . the spd has previously avoided all contact in the western states with the left , which many germans see as a party of unreconstructed communists in the east and fringe leftists in the west . in the eastern states , where the left is the largest party with estimated support of around 30 percent , the spd has entered into a coalition with the party in the city-state of berlin . concessions to left risk political spilt the opening up to the left , initiated late last month by beck , has caused a rift in the party , germany 's oldest political formation with strong links to the trade union movement . merkel and other cdu leaders have openly accused beck and ypsilanti of breaking their pre-election promises . ypsilanti aims to have herself elected premier by the state legislature with the party 's support in a secret ballot on april 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi is willing to give the spd the votes they need left party leader in the federal parliament , gregor gysi , pledged the full support of the party for ypsilanti in the vote . " i give her a guarantee for the six votes that she needs , " he said . but observers did not rule out the possibility that spd members opposed to the deal might use the secrecy of the ballot to scupper ypsilanti 's plans by abstaining . ypsilanti said tuesday she would seek shifting majorities with the fdp and the cdu to push through educational reforms and an energy policy based on renewable resources for the state , which includes the financial centre of frankfurt . analysts believe she could seek an early election after making her policy aims clear . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german construction worker kidnapped in nigeria on tuesday , mar .
4 , has been released unharmed - just 12 hours after he was seized .
but it was the first foreign hostagetaking in the area for several months . " he was released at 11pm .
no ransom was paid , " a source at the hostage 's employers , julius berger , told reuters news agency .
details of the abduction remain sketchy , but unknown gunmen killed at least one military escort during the kidnapping near emuoha in the niger delta .
and there are conflicting reports about the fate of the foreign worker 's driver . the german-nigerian construction company julius berger is currently upgrading the road there , which leads out of port harcourt , the area 's main city . is the threat to foreign workers growing again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militants have battled for control of the oil pipelines and revenues the unnamed german was the first foreigner seized since october in the delta .
it is unclear whether tuesday 's abduction was an isolated incident or signals a return to more unsettled times for expatriates .
over 200 foreign workers have been kidnapped by militants and ransom seekers since 2006 .
nearly all of them were released unharmed .
the record oil prices on world markets has , in part , been triggered by the violence and supply disruptions in the niger delta , the base of africa 's biggest oil industry which produces 2.1 million barrels per day .

but kidnapping is also big business in the area , and it is not just restricted to foreign workers .
abductions of nigerians judged wealthy enough to pay a ransom , have not undergone a lull since october , but have continued unabated . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's federal cartel office has launched a probe of 35 natural gas suppliers suspected of charging excessively high prices . german authorities had noted price differences that ranged from 25 percent to 45 percent , the office said in a statement on wednesday , march 5 . the cartel office would therefore check whether recent german gas price hikes were justified , it added . " horribly weak " competition office head bernhard heitzer said preliminary results of the probe suggested that competition was " still horribly weak " in the gas sector . " from what we know now , an entire series of companies have raised gas prices to a level that they could never demand in a functioning , competitive economy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as much as 20 percent of the german market stands to be affected by the probe the price increases concerned four million clients and around 20 percent of the market , the office said . a spokesman contacted by the afp news service declined to provide the names of companies under investigation , saying only that national and regional firms were concerned . in all , 770 companies supply gas to households and companies in germany , of which around 30 are active throughout the country . some do n't pass on savings regional anti-cartel offices had also launched their own investigations into gas price increases . heitzer said a number of companies were raising gas prices in a way that would be impossible to do in a normal competitive situation . " even in places where the network fees are low , that price advantage is n't necessarily passed on to clients ; the savings appear to be used to boost the company 's value in another area , " heitzer added . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is not a lot to pay , " said angel gurria , oecd head , in a 520-page environmental outlook presented in oslo , adding that this was similar to the cost of an insurance policy .
" the consequences and costs of inaction would be much higher , " said gurria .
unchecked environmental damage could mean four billion people would be without adequate water supplies by 2030 , and leave the world facing heat waves , droughts and floods by the end of the century .
mounting evidence in favor of green measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant pandas are among the species threatened by environmental destruction the study adds to evidence that curbing global warming is affordable .
last year , the un climate panel said that measures to tackle climate change would cost between 0.06 and 0.1 percent of world gross domestic product a year to 2030 .
the report focuses on several key areas including climate change , the reduction in biodiversity , water shortages , illegal logging and the impact of pollution and toxic chemicals on human health .
" if no new policy actions are taken , within the next few decades , we risk irreversibly altering the environmental basis for sustained economic prosperity , " the report said .
green taxes , emissions trading and polluter-pay systems were among suggested measures .
it also recommended revamping the most damaging industries , such as energy , transport , agriculture and fisheries .
norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg , whose country contributed funding for the report , said the study underlined the need to " find solutions where we are able to combine economic development with the environment . "
the report projected that inaction would lead to a rise in global greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 .
green package could cut emissions by over 20 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd is calling for an overhaul of the energy market the study suggested a hypothetical policy package , including a 50 percent cut in farm subsidies , a 16.50 euro -lrb- $ 25 -rrb- per tonne tax on emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide phased in by region , new biofuels , measures to cut air pollution and improved sewerage systems .
if this package were implemented , the study said emissions would be slashed to around 13 percent .
to combate climate change , the oecd said " developed countries will need to work closely with emerging economies - especially brazil , russia , india , indonesia , china and south africa . "
if nothing is done , greenhouse emissions from china , india , russia and brazil alone would " grow by 46 percent to 2030 , surpassing those of the 30 oecd countries combined , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu cities commit to climate package , but challenges lay ahead fighting global warming can happen one city at a time .

" this is not a lot to pay , " said angel gurria , oecd head , in a 520-page environmental outlook presented in oslo , adding that this was similar to the cost of an insurance policy .
" the consequences and costs of inaction would be much higher , " said gurria .
unchecked environmental damage could mean four billion people would be without adequate water supplies by 2030 , and leave the world facing heat waves , droughts and floods by the end of the century .
mounting evidence in favor of green measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant pandas are among the species threatened by environmental destruction the study adds to evidence that curbing global warming is affordable .
last year , the un climate panel said that measures to tackle climate change would cost between 0.06 and 0.1 percent of world gross domestic product a year to 2030 .
the report focuses on several key areas including climate change , the reduction in biodiversity , water shortages , illegal logging and the impact of pollution and toxic chemicals on human health .
" if no new policy actions are taken , within the next few decades , we risk irreversibly altering the environmental basis for sustained economic prosperity , " the report said .
green taxes , emissions trading and polluter-pay systems were among suggested measures .
it also recommended revamping the most damaging industries , such as energy , transport , agriculture and fisheries .
norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg , whose country contributed funding for the report , said the study underlined the need to " find solutions where we are able to combine economic development with the environment . "
the report projected that inaction would lead to a rise in global greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 .
green package could cut emissions by over 20 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd is calling for an overhaul of the energy market the study suggested a hypothetical policy package , including a 50 percent cut in farm subsidies , a 16.50 euro -lrb- $ 25 -rrb- per tonne tax on emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide phased in by region , new biofuels , measures to cut air pollution and improved sewerage systems .
if this package were implemented , the study said emissions would be slashed to around 13 percent .
to combate climate change , the oecd said " developed countries will need to work closely with emerging economies - especially brazil , russia , india , indonesia , china and south africa . "
if nothing is done , greenhouse emissions from china , india , russia and brazil alone would " grow by 46 percent to 2030 , surpassing those of the 30 oecd countries combined , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.03.2008 german orchestra takes richard wagner to abu dhabi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatskapelle is temporarily leaving the stately semperoper the new york philharmonic is hardly the only orchestra to have visited a " hostile " country .
dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .
that 's their very ambitious goal .
so you plan on continuing to work in abu dhabi ?
that will depend on whether the concert is as successful as we think and hope it will be .
our goal is to leave a lasting impression so that people are exciting about experiencing classical music .

dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .
that 's their very ambitious goal .
so you plan on continuing to work in abu dhabi ?
that will depend on whether the concert is as successful as we think and hope it will be .
our goal is to leave a lasting impression so that people are exciting about experiencing classical music .
after that , we 'll see .
but there 's no reason , after the opera house there is completed , why we could n't stage the first complete cycle of wagner 's ring operas in the arab world . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's federal cartel office has launched a probe of 35 natural gas suppliers suspected of charging excessively high prices . german authorities had noted price differences that ranged from 25 percent to 45 percent , the office said in a statement on wednesday , march 5 . the cartel office would therefore check whether recent german gas price hikes were justified , it added . " horribly weak " competition office head bernhard heitzer said preliminary results of the probe suggested that competition was " still horribly weak " in the gas sector . " from what we know now , an entire series of companies have raised gas prices to a level that they could never demand in a functioning , competitive economy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as much as 20 percent of the german market stands to be affected by the probe the price increases concerned four million clients and around 20 percent of the market , the office said . a spokesman contacted by the afp news service declined to provide the names of companies under investigation , saying only that national and regional firms were concerned . in all , 770 companies supply gas to households and companies in germany , of which around 30 are active throughout the country . some do n't pass on savings regional anti-cartel offices had also launched their own investigations into gas price increases . heitzer said a number of companies were raising gas prices in a way that would be impossible to do in a normal competitive situation . " even in places where the network fees are low , that price advantage is n't necessarily passed on to clients ; the savings appear to be used to boost the company 's value in another area , " heitzer added . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after all the years of america-bashing and bush-bashing around the world , americans have the opportunity to like themselves more because the dream of the country seems to work again , " von marschall said . and the " charisma factor " can not be underestimated among germans either .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.03.2008 german orchestra takes richard wagner to abu dhabi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatskapelle is temporarily leaving the stately semperoper the new york philharmonic is hardly the only orchestra to have visited a " hostile " country .
dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .
that 's their very ambitious goal .
so you plan on continuing to work in abu dhabi ?
that will depend on whether the concert is as successful as we think and hope it will be .
our goal is to leave a lasting impression so that people are exciting about experiencing classical music .
after that , we 'll see .
but there 's no reason , after the opera house there is completed , why we could n't stage the first complete cycle of wagner 's ring operas in the arab world . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german construction worker kidnapped in nigeria on tuesday , mar .
4 , has been released unharmed - just 12 hours after he was seized .
but it was the first foreign hostagetaking in the area for several months . " he was released at 11pm .
no ransom was paid , " a source at the hostage 's employers , julius berger , told reuters news agency .
details of the abduction remain sketchy , but unknown gunmen killed at least one military escort during the kidnapping near emuoha in the niger delta .
and there are conflicting reports about the fate of the foreign worker 's driver . the german-nigerian construction company julius berger is currently upgrading the road there , which leads out of port harcourt , the area 's main city . is the threat to foreign workers growing again ?

it is unclear whether tuesday 's abduction was an isolated incident or signals a return to more unsettled times for expatriates .
over 200 foreign workers have been kidnapped by militants and ransom seekers since 2006 .
nearly all of them were released unharmed .

but kidnapping is also big business in the area , and it is not just restricted to foreign workers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.03.2008 german orchestra takes richard wagner to abu dhabi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatskapelle is temporarily leaving the stately semperoper the new york philharmonic is hardly the only orchestra to have visited a " hostile " country .
dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .
that 's their very ambitious goal .
so you plan on continuing to work in abu dhabi ?
that will depend on whether the concert is as successful as we think and hope it will be .
our goal is to leave a lasting impression so that people are exciting about experiencing classical music .
after that , we 'll see .
but there 's no reason , after the opera house there is completed , why we could n't stage the first complete cycle of wagner 's ring operas in the arab world . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .
that 's their very ambitious goal .
so you plan on continuing to work in abu dhabi ?
that will depend on whether the concert is as successful as we think and hope it will be .
our goal is to leave a lasting impression so that people are exciting about experiencing classical music .
after that , we 'll see .
but there 's no reason , after the opera house there is completed , why we could n't stage the first complete cycle of wagner 's ring operas in the arab world . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but her main opponents want her to consider a grand coalition . six weeks after inconclusive elections in the western state , hesse 's social democratic part -lrb- spd -rrb- leader , andrea ypsilanti , said her preferred combination of the spd , the greens and the liberal fdp had foundered on opposition from the fdp . the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , said it wanted to engage in talks with ypsilanti over a grand coalition , similar to the national power-sharing agreement , according to cdu state parliamentary leader christean wagner . he told broadcaster deutschlandfunk on wednesday , march 5 , a grand coalition would be the only way to keep the left party from increasing its influence . ypsilanti , who positions herself on the left wing of the spd , indicated on tuesday , she would accept being voted into office as premier with the help of the six left party members of the new legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti wants to form a government with the left she acknowledged that this was in conflict with her pre-election position . " it could happen that i can not stick to an election promise , " she said .
" believe me , this is not easy for me . " the german public is divided on whether the spd and cdu should cooperate with the left , according to a forsa study published in german news weekly stern . some 52 percent of germans said they were against parties associating with left while 42 percent said they could imagine such a tie-up . ypsilanti and spd national head kurt beck pledged ahead of the jan .
27 poll that they would not enter into any agreement with the left , a party that draws most of its support from left-wing spd breakaways and in the formerly communist eastern states . left a key player in coalition deals the spd emerged from the elections with 36.7 percent of the vote , behind chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats on 36.8 percent .
both parties have 42 seats in the 110-seat legislature . the free-market liberal fdp , normally the cdu 's ideal coalition partner , has 11 seats , and the greens , the spd 's preferred partner , have nine .
the left , with six seats , holds the balance . the spd has previously avoided all contact in the western states with the left , which many germans see as a party of unreconstructed communists in the east and fringe leftists in the west . in the eastern states , where the left is the largest party with estimated support of around 30 percent , the spd has entered into a coalition with the party in the city-state of berlin . concessions to left risk political spilt the opening up to the left , initiated late last month by beck , has caused a rift in the party , germany 's oldest political formation with strong links to the trade union movement . merkel and other cdu leaders have openly accused beck and ypsilanti of breaking their pre-election promises . ypsilanti aims to have herself elected premier by the state legislature with the party 's support in a secret ballot on april 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi is willing to give the spd the votes they need left party leader in the federal parliament , gregor gysi , pledged the full support of the party for ypsilanti in the vote . " i give her a guarantee for the six votes that she needs , " he said . but observers did not rule out the possibility that spd members opposed to the deal might use the secrecy of the ballot to scupper ypsilanti 's plans by abstaining . ypsilanti said tuesday she would seek shifting majorities with the fdp and the cdu to push through educational reforms and an energy policy based on renewable resources for the state , which includes the financial centre of frankfurt . analysts believe she could seek an early election after making her policy aims clear . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is not a lot to pay , " said angel gurria , oecd head , in a 520-page environmental outlook presented in oslo , adding that this was similar to the cost of an insurance policy .
" the consequences and costs of inaction would be much higher , " said gurria .
unchecked environmental damage could mean four billion people would be without adequate water supplies by 2030 , and leave the world facing heat waves , droughts and floods by the end of the century .
mounting evidence in favor of green measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant pandas are among the species threatened by environmental destruction the study adds to evidence that curbing global warming is affordable .
last year , the un climate panel said that measures to tackle climate change would cost between 0.06 and 0.1 percent of world gross domestic product a year to 2030 .
the report focuses on several key areas including climate change , the reduction in biodiversity , water shortages , illegal logging and the impact of pollution and toxic chemicals on human health .
" if no new policy actions are taken , within the next few decades , we risk irreversibly altering the environmental basis for sustained economic prosperity , " the report said .
green taxes , emissions trading and polluter-pay systems were among suggested measures .
it also recommended revamping the most damaging industries , such as energy , transport , agriculture and fisheries .
norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg , whose country contributed funding for the report , said the study underlined the need to " find solutions where we are able to combine economic development with the environment . "
the report projected that inaction would lead to a rise in global greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 .

while the decision about the nomination could ultimately be left to the superdelegates , right now , obama remains ahead in terms of popular votes . message of change resonates with germans in germany , obama 's popularity has much to do with the fact that the young senator from illinois represents a change from the present government and policies in america , some say .

" this is not a lot to pay , " said angel gurria , oecd head , in a 520-page environmental outlook presented in oslo , adding that this was similar to the cost of an insurance policy .
" the consequences and costs of inaction would be much higher , " said gurria .
unchecked environmental damage could mean four billion people would be without adequate water supplies by 2030 , and leave the world facing heat waves , droughts and floods by the end of the century .
mounting evidence in favor of green measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant pandas are among the species threatened by environmental destruction the study adds to evidence that curbing global warming is affordable .
last year , the un climate panel said that measures to tackle climate change would cost between 0.06 and 0.1 percent of world gross domestic product a year to 2030 .
the report focuses on several key areas including climate change , the reduction in biodiversity , water shortages , illegal logging and the impact of pollution and toxic chemicals on human health .
" if no new policy actions are taken , within the next few decades , we risk irreversibly altering the environmental basis for sustained economic prosperity , " the report said .
green taxes , emissions trading and polluter-pay systems were among suggested measures .
it also recommended revamping the most damaging industries , such as energy , transport , agriculture and fisheries .
norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg , whose country contributed funding for the report , said the study underlined the need to " find solutions where we are able to combine economic development with the environment . "
the report projected that inaction would lead to a rise in global greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 .
green package could cut emissions by over 20 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd is calling for an overhaul of the energy market the study suggested a hypothetical policy package , including a 50 percent cut in farm subsidies , a 16.50 euro -lrb- $ 25 -rrb- per tonne tax on emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide phased in by region , new biofuels , measures to cut air pollution and improved sewerage systems .
if this package were implemented , the study said emissions would be slashed to around 13 percent .
to combate climate change , the oecd said " developed countries will need to work closely with emerging economies - especially brazil , russia , india , indonesia , china and south africa . "
if nothing is done , greenhouse emissions from china , india , russia and brazil alone would " grow by 46 percent to 2030 , surpassing those of the 30 oecd countries combined , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.03.2008 german orchestra takes richard wagner to abu dhabi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatskapelle is temporarily leaving the stately semperoper the new york philharmonic is hardly the only orchestra to have visited a " hostile " country .
dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .
that 's their very ambitious goal .
so you plan on continuing to work in abu dhabi ?
that will depend on whether the concert is as successful as we think and hope it will be .
our goal is to leave a lasting impression so that people are exciting about experiencing classical music .
after that , we 'll see .

germany 's federal cartel office has launched a probe of 35 natural gas suppliers suspected of charging excessively high prices . german authorities had noted price differences that ranged from 25 percent to 45 percent , the office said in a statement on wednesday , march 5 . the cartel office would therefore check whether recent german gas price hikes were justified , it added . " horribly weak " competition office head bernhard heitzer said preliminary results of the probe suggested that competition was " still horribly weak " in the gas sector . " from what we know now , an entire series of companies have raised gas prices to a level that they could never demand in a functioning , competitive economy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as much as 20 percent of the german market stands to be affected by the probe the price increases concerned four million clients and around 20 percent of the market , the office said . a spokesman contacted by the afp news service declined to provide the names of companies under investigation , saying only that national and regional firms were concerned . in all , 770 companies supply gas to households and companies in germany , of which around 30 are active throughout the country . some do n't pass on savings regional anti-cartel offices had also launched their own investigations into gas price increases . heitzer said a number of companies were raising gas prices in a way that would be impossible to do in a normal competitive situation . " even in places where the network fees are low , that price advantage is n't necessarily passed on to clients ; the savings appear to be used to boost the company 's value in another area , " heitzer added . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german construction worker kidnapped in nigeria on tuesday , mar .
4 , has been released unharmed - just 12 hours after he was seized .
but it was the first foreign hostagetaking in the area for several months . " he was released at 11pm .
no ransom was paid , " a source at the hostage 's employers , julius berger , told reuters news agency .
details of the abduction remain sketchy , but unknown gunmen killed at least one military escort during the kidnapping near emuoha in the niger delta .
and there are conflicting reports about the fate of the foreign worker 's driver . the german-nigerian construction company julius berger is currently upgrading the road there , which leads out of port harcourt , the area 's main city . is the threat to foreign workers growing again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militants have battled for control of the oil pipelines and revenues the unnamed german was the first foreigner seized since october in the delta .
it is unclear whether tuesday 's abduction was an isolated incident or signals a return to more unsettled times for expatriates .
over 200 foreign workers have been kidnapped by militants and ransom seekers since 2006 .
nearly all of them were released unharmed .
the record oil prices on world markets has , in part , been triggered by the violence and supply disruptions in the niger delta , the base of africa 's biggest oil industry which produces 2.1 million barrels per day .

but kidnapping is also big business in the area , and it is not just restricted to foreign workers .

" this is not a lot to pay , " said angel gurria , oecd head , in a 520-page environmental outlook presented in oslo , adding that this was similar to the cost of an insurance policy .
" the consequences and costs of inaction would be much higher , " said gurria .
unchecked environmental damage could mean four billion people would be without adequate water supplies by 2030 , and leave the world facing heat waves , droughts and floods by the end of the century .
mounting evidence in favor of green measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant pandas are among the species threatened by environmental destruction the study adds to evidence that curbing global warming is affordable .
last year , the un climate panel said that measures to tackle climate change would cost between 0.06 and 0.1 percent of world gross domestic product a year to 2030 .
the report focuses on several key areas including climate change , the reduction in biodiversity , water shortages , illegal logging and the impact of pollution and toxic chemicals on human health .
" if no new policy actions are taken , within the next few decades , we risk irreversibly altering the environmental basis for sustained economic prosperity , " the report said .
green taxes , emissions trading and polluter-pay systems were among suggested measures .
it also recommended revamping the most damaging industries , such as energy , transport , agriculture and fisheries .
norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg , whose country contributed funding for the report , said the study underlined the need to " find solutions where we are able to combine economic development with the environment . "
the report projected that inaction would lead to a rise in global greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 .
green package could cut emissions by over 20 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oecd is calling for an overhaul of the energy market the study suggested a hypothetical policy package , including a 50 percent cut in farm subsidies , a 16.50 euro -lrb- $ 25 -rrb- per tonne tax on emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide phased in by region , new biofuels , measures to cut air pollution and improved sewerage systems .
if this package were implemented , the study said emissions would be slashed to around 13 percent .
to combate climate change , the oecd said " developed countries will need to work closely with emerging economies - especially brazil , russia , india , indonesia , china and south africa . "
if nothing is done , greenhouse emissions from china , india , russia and brazil alone would " grow by 46 percent to 2030 , surpassing those of the 30 oecd countries combined , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke to jan nast , orchestral director of dresden 's staatskapelle , about whether music can build bridges between cultures . the tradition of " classical diplomacy " in germany runs long and deep .
in the 1970s and 1980s , romanian-born conductor sergiu celibidache and the munich philharmonic were very active in communist eastern europe and often enlisted by the west german government as cultural ambassadors .
since 1999 , the argentina-born musical director of berlin 's state opera house , daniel barenboim , has led the east-western divan orchestra , which united israeli and palestinian musicians .
in 2005 , the berlin philharmonic made an extensive trip to china , which is the subject of a film released this week .
on saturday , march 8 , the saechsische staatskapelle dresden - saxony 's state orchestra - is scheduled to perform an all-wagner concert in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
dw-world.de spoke to orchestra director jan nast about high culture and the everyday task of creating cultural understanding .
dw-world.de : can music really be a tool of peace or dialogue , or is that just empty idealism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : principal conductor fabio luisi will lead the orchestra jan nast : that 's a very difficult question .
i 'm convinced that music can definitely connect people , because i think listening to something and deciding whether you like it or not is a common denominator . so i also think that a concert can bring people who have different politics or religions a bit closer to one another .
in abu dhabi , the staatskapelle has chosen an all-wagner program .
leaving aside the fact that wagner was once the principle conductor of the orchestra , why focus on a relatively difficult composer for an audience that may be unfamiliar with classical music ?
there are at least three reasons .
i 've been in contact with abu dhabi for quite some time , and via the german embassy there , a lot of my e-mails ended up at a richard wagner society , which had just been founded .
it was the first society of its kind in the arab world , and when they saw e-mails from the staatskapelle dresden they said , " hey , that richard wagner 's orchestra . "
also , one of the organizers is doing a phd on wagner and romanticism , so there was a lot of enthusiasm about initiating a large-scale project with us .
and the third reason was that people told us that the romantic aspects of wagner - the themes of forbidden or fatal love in his operas - might represent a level on which young arabs could be motivated to come to a classical concert and listen to music that 's otherwise culturally foreign to them .
music from the arab world has very different harmonies and structures as compared to european classical music .
european classical music must sound quite bizarre in some arab ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concert will take place at the luxury " emirates palace " yes , you 're right .
music from the arab world is completely different .
it 's constructed differently , the musical language is different , and so are the harmonies .
nonetheless , i think that the structures of romanticism , how the individual notes interact with one another , are similar to those in arab music .
and then there 's the content .
we 're working with three universities in abu dhabi .
beginning last week , there have been lectures on romanticism , on richard wagner , on wagner 's career in dresden and on specific themes from the operas .
i hope that this constellation will lure people to the concert who 've never heard such music before and will perhaps be surprised that it 's not bad at all .
even though they 've never heard anything like it .
the new york philharmonic 's trip to north korea attracted lots of headlines .
but it was n't the first event of its kind , was it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel barenboim 's east-western divan orchestra is another political project no , especially on the german landscape , there have been many politically active orchestras .
it 's something of a tradition .
i can remember that in the 1980s german presidents often traveled with the munich philharmonic and helped set up concert dates for the purpose of bridging political gaps - in order to pave the way for possible political negotiations afterward .
and we at the staatskapelle , too , have often undertaken mediating roles in the past .
it 's a different context , but one week after hurricane katrina , we went to new orleans and gave a concert called " music helps . "
we could n't bring the people there lots of money , but we could encourage them not to give up in a dire situation .
we have also been planning to do something for years with korea - through our ongoing cooperation with korean conductor myung-whun chung , whose mother is from the north .
especially as an orchestra from the eastern half of what was once a divided country , we could transmit a very positive message about what it 's like to be reunited after so many years .
the new york philharmonic grabbed the limelight somewhat , but the message remains - and it is perhaps one that only we can communicate .
on the other hand , abu dhabi is hardly north korea .
it 's a wealthy oil emirate that 's currently investing huge sums to attract western culture .
are there other advantages to working there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra director jan nast checks out abu dhabi 's ambitious plans certainly .
at the moment , all the leading cultural institutions are closely watching the united arab emirates , because the uae is clearly planning to orient itself toward western culture in the coming years .
having looked at the architectural projects in abu dhabi , i would say they 're aiming to become a six-star cultural travel destination - in contrast to the five-star mass tourism resorts being built in some of the other emirates .
the newly constructed " cultural island " -lsb- saadiyat island -rsb- is unbelievable .
the world 's most important museums have branches there ; a beautiful and presumably acoustically excellent performing-arts center is being built , and the whole location will become something like a year-round arts festival .
so it 's natural that big cultural institutions like the louvre , the british museum or the guggenheim use it to stock up their domestic finances .
and one thing is true - if you want to see the best of the old masters and modern artists , and hear the finest in music , there 's going to be only one place in the world , and that 's there .
that 's their very ambitious goal .
so you plan on continuing to work in abu dhabi ?
that will depend on whether the concert is as successful as we think and hope it will be .
our goal is to leave a lasting impression so that people are exciting about experiencing classical music .
after that , we 'll see .
but there 's no reason , after the opera house there is completed , why we could n't stage the first complete cycle of wagner 's ring operas in the arab world . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

philip emafo , president of the international narcotics control board -lrb- incb -rrb- , warned against treating famous drug users too softly .
when celebrities took illegal drugs , he said , it glamorised narcotics abuse .
his message came as the incb released its annual report , which also called for top drug dealers to be targeted .
too many governments target low-level street dealers but do little to tackle big criminal gangs , the report said .
afghanistan alarm " celebrities are often involved in illicit drug trafficking or in illicit drug use and this is glamorised , " said mr emafo .
have your say celebrity drug users get off too lightly because we do n't want to see our icons fall from grace jonathan , london send us your comments " if , indeed , they have committed offences they should be dealt with . "
the report also expressed alarm at the escalating problems in afghanistan , which produces 93 % of the world 's opium .
abuse of the drug was a major problem for the country and its neighbours such as iran , which had the world 's highest rate of opiates abuse , said the report .
the chemical acetic anhydride , which is used in the production of heroin , was becoming more readily available in afghanistan , warned the vienna-based incb .
it called on neighbouring governments to stop the chemical from being smuggled into afghan territory .

prime minister gordon brown ian paisley has made a huge contribution to political life in northern ireland and the united kingdom .
the whole country values and admires the manner in which he has led as first minister .
his commitment and dedication to public service deserve our gratitude .
progress on bringing a lasting peace to northern ireland would not have been possible without his immense courage and leadership .
irish prime minister bertie ahern i honestly believe that it -lrb- devolution -rrb- will last because i believe there are very pragmatic people in all of the parties .
we hope and pray that what has been achieved through the leadership of dr paisley , and others , will continue .
tony blair , former prime minister ian paisley 's contribution to peace , after all the years of division and difference was decisive and determinative .
in short , in the final analysis , he made it happen .
the man famous for saying ' no ' will go down in history for saying ' yes ' .
he did so personally convinced it was right and in reaching that conviction , consigning to the past the feelings he once so trenchantly articulated .
blair on paisley 's ' courage ' northern ireland deputy first minister martin mcguinness ian paisley has played a very powerful role in the course of the politics of the north of ireland and the island of ireland .
the historic decision he took to go into government with sinn fein has changed the face of irish politics forever .
i think that he will be fondly remembered by the people of ireland - north and south - for the very courageous leadership that he showed .
mcguinness : ' i respect his decision ' ian paisley jnr , democratic unionist party ian paisley is the epitome of a great ulsterman .
like an anvil of old , hammer blows smash on him but he remains sure and unbowed .
to this son he is a great father .
indeed , everything a father could be .
my tribute to him can not be measured in the tape of words but in the silence of an ever-thankful heart , a bottomless cavern of gratitude , love , devotion and regard will forever echo his praises .
peter robinson , democratic unionist party deputy leader it has been said that the greatest test of a politician 's success is the degree to which he forces his opponents to change .
by that standard , ian paisley 's career has been a remarkable and outstanding success .
when dr paisley entered politics our position within the union was being eroded .
sinn fein vowed to bring down stormont .
today they are sitting inside stormont in a northern ireland assembly as a minority party of a unionist majority executive .
the ira was armed and engaged in a bloody murder campaign .
today republicans have been forced to give up their guns and embrace the policing structures of the british state .
danny kennedy , ulster unionist party deputy leader the attacks on ian paisley jnr were used as proxy attacks on ian paisley snr and were aimed deliberately at weakening his overall political position .
i think the party had come to the conclusion that the chuckle brothers issue was hurting them .
baroness paisley , earlier this week , was keen to stress that she believed that her husband still had work to do .
that has n't been the view that has prevailed in the assembly party or indeed other assembly colleagues .
mark durkan , sdlp leader while this is very significant political news , there is responsibility on all of us as politicians to make the most of the political processes here no matter who comes or goes .
in particular , we have to make a success of the investment conference in may and not allow this story to distort or distract from this focus grand orange lodge ian paisley has strode across the british and irish political scene like a giant for many years .
no-one could ignore his forthright views and while not everyone agreed with him , his personal commitment was never in doubt .
he has been particularly supportive of the institution during the current campaign of arson attacks on orange halls .
we wish dr paisley a long and happy retirement .
jim allister , traditional unionist voice leader it has been quite clear for some time that ian paisley was going to be hung out to dry by the dup pragmatists .
he had served his purpose .
he had delivered what they had devised , but could n't sell themselves - government with unrepentant terrorists .
shaun woodward , northern ireland secretary of state dr paisley has provided outstanding leadership as first minister and has brought his party to the historic position of power sharing government in northern ireland .
the establishment of peace and continued prosperity which everyone in northern ireland now enjoys undoubtedly owes a significant debt to the leadership of dr paisley .
david cameron , conservative party leader ian paisley has been a formidable figure in british politics for many decades .
his term as first minister of northern ireland has helped to forge a peace which many thought was impossible to achieve .
dr paisley 's willingness to work closely with former opponents to build a new future for northern ireland has captured the world 's imagination and earned him the gratitude of the people of northern ireland .
peter hain , former northern ireland secretary of state he played an absolutely historic role in ending the deadlock and establishing permanent devolved government and deserves enormous credit for the courage and vision he showed .
i am sure that the decision he has taken will be the best one for his family as a very close family man .
i wish him all the best for the future .
david ford , alliance leader history will judge whether ian paisley will be remembered for 40 years of saying no or one year of saying probably .
many will say his road to damascus conversion came 35 years too late .
the achievements of the executive since last may have been modest in the extreme .
paula dobriansky , us president 's special envoy on northern ireland on behalf of the united states , i would like to congratulate dr ian paisley on his service to the people of northern ireland , and his historic role in bringing about a peaceful political settlement that will ensure a better future for northern ireland .
i have been impressed by dr paisley 's commitment to working for the greater good of the people of northern ireland in cooperation with deputy first minister martin mcguinness and the northern ireland executive .
it has been my pleasure to work with him .

prime minister gordon brown ian paisley has made a huge contribution to political life in northern ireland and the united kingdom .
the whole country values and admires the manner in which he has led as first minister .
his commitment and dedication to public service deserve our gratitude .
progress on bringing a lasting peace to northern ireland would not have been possible without his immense courage and leadership .
irish prime minister bertie ahern i honestly believe that it -lrb- devolution -rrb- will last because i believe there are very pragmatic people in all of the parties .
we hope and pray that what has been achieved through the leadership of dr paisley , and others , will continue .
tony blair , former prime minister ian paisley 's contribution to peace , after all the years of division and difference was decisive and determinative .
in short , in the final analysis , he made it happen .
the man famous for saying ' no ' will go down in history for saying ' yes ' .
he did so personally convinced it was right and in reaching that conviction , consigning to the past the feelings he once so trenchantly articulated .
blair on paisley 's ' courage ' northern ireland deputy first minister martin mcguinness ian paisley has played a very powerful role in the course of the politics of the north of ireland and the island of ireland .
the historic decision he took to go into government with sinn fein has changed the face of irish politics forever .
i think that he will be fondly remembered by the people of ireland - north and south - for the very courageous leadership that he showed .
mcguinness : ' i respect his decision ' ian paisley jnr , democratic unionist party ian paisley is the epitome of a great ulsterman .
like an anvil of old , hammer blows smash on him but he remains sure and unbowed .
to this son he is a great father .
indeed , everything a father could be .
my tribute to him can not be measured in the tape of words but in the silence of an ever-thankful heart , a bottomless cavern of gratitude , love , devotion and regard will forever echo his praises .
peter robinson , democratic unionist party deputy leader it has been said that the greatest test of a politician 's success is the degree to which he forces his opponents to change .
by that standard , ian paisley 's career has been a remarkable and outstanding success .
when dr paisley entered politics our position within the union was being eroded .
sinn fein vowed to bring down stormont .
today they are sitting inside stormont in a northern ireland assembly as a minority party of a unionist majority executive .
the ira was armed and engaged in a bloody murder campaign .
today republicans have been forced to give up their guns and embrace the policing structures of the british state .
danny kennedy , ulster unionist party deputy leader the attacks on ian paisley jnr were used as proxy attacks on ian paisley snr and were aimed deliberately at weakening his overall political position .
i think the party had come to the conclusion that the chuckle brothers issue was hurting them .
baroness paisley , earlier this week , was keen to stress that she believed that her husband still had work to do .
that has n't been the view that has prevailed in the assembly party or indeed other assembly colleagues .
mark durkan , sdlp leader while this is very significant political news , there is responsibility on all of us as politicians to make the most of the political processes here no matter who comes or goes .
in particular , we have to make a success of the investment conference in may and not allow this story to distort or distract from this focus grand orange lodge ian paisley has strode across the british and irish political scene like a giant for many years .
no-one could ignore his forthright views and while not everyone agreed with him , his personal commitment was never in doubt .
he has been particularly supportive of the institution during the current campaign of arson attacks on orange halls .
we wish dr paisley a long and happy retirement .
jim allister , traditional unionist voice leader it has been quite clear for some time that ian paisley was going to be hung out to dry by the dup pragmatists .
he had served his purpose .
he had delivered what they had devised , but could n't sell themselves - government with unrepentant terrorists .
shaun woodward , northern ireland secretary of state dr paisley has provided outstanding leadership as first minister and has brought his party to the historic position of power sharing government in northern ireland .
the establishment of peace and continued prosperity which everyone in northern ireland now enjoys undoubtedly owes a significant debt to the leadership of dr paisley .
david cameron , conservative party leader ian paisley has been a formidable figure in british politics for many decades .
his term as first minister of northern ireland has helped to forge a peace which many thought was impossible to achieve .
dr paisley 's willingness to work closely with former opponents to build a new future for northern ireland has captured the world 's imagination and earned him the gratitude of the people of northern ireland .
peter hain , former northern ireland secretary of state he played an absolutely historic role in ending the deadlock and establishing permanent devolved government and deserves enormous credit for the courage and vision he showed .
i am sure that the decision he has taken will be the best one for his family as a very close family man .
i wish him all the best for the future .
david ford , alliance leader history will judge whether ian paisley will be remembered for 40 years of saying no or one year of saying probably .
many will say his road to damascus conversion came 35 years too late .
the achievements of the executive since last may have been modest in the extreme .
paula dobriansky , us president 's special envoy on northern ireland on behalf of the united states , i would like to congratulate dr ian paisley on his service to the people of northern ireland , and his historic role in bringing about a peaceful political settlement that will ensure a better future for northern ireland .
i have been impressed by dr paisley 's commitment to working for the greater good of the people of northern ireland in cooperation with deputy first minister martin mcguinness and the northern ireland executive .
it has been my pleasure to work with him .

it may be an everyday occurrence for families across the world , but 30-year-old asma is a widow with five children and no job and is one of the poorest people in an already poor neighbourhood : temeke , in dar es salaam .
her mud house with its disintegrating grass roof is conspicuous among her neighbours ' brick-built houses with corrugated iron roofs .
" before i was facing a miserable life .
i had little money , we had little food and i could n't afford to send my children to school , " she said .
" i did n't know how my family could survive . "
turned around asma says her life has turned round following the intervention and help of her local authority " i have been given books and a school uniform for my son .
he has been able to go to secondary school for the first time . "
the financial and material support from temeke council has addressed very immediate needs but social support has also been invaluable , she says .
" perhaps what has been most useful is the advice i have been given about how to look after my children without the help of an extended family . "
that advice has included a range of life skills : caring for her family , managing the small amount of money she makes from selling small fried bread rolls known as mandazi , as well as advice on family planning and hiv / aids prevention .
changing societies asma is one of the lucky few who have benefited from a system that is working well in one small area of dar es salaam , but which is unique in tanzania and could be copied by countries throughout africa .
the demand for social welfare support of this type is increasing across the continent , partly because of the number of children who are being orphaned by aids , but also because the migration of rural people to the city has led to a breakdown in family support structures .
temeke , with its population of 750,000 , is home to around 9,500 " most vulnerable children " -lrb- mvcs -rrb- , as they are known in development jargon : a 10 % increase on the previous year .
according to the institute of social work -lrb- isw -rrb- , tanzania needs at least 8,000 more social workers to meet the increasing demand .
its response has been to train existing community development officers and representatives of community-based and non-governmental organisations as so-called para-social workers .
" there are many professionals who are working at community level who frequently come into contact with mvcs , " says the institute 's judith bagachwa .
" we can give these people social work skills with which they can support people who would otherwise not receive any services . "
para-social worker alfreda george is a good example .
she is an agriculture field officer for temeke council providing nutrition advice and support for small urban agricultural projects .
following her training as a para-social worker by isw , she has been able to offer life-changing advice to the disadvantaged people she meets .
" we are able to make a real difference for people like asma and her children , " said alfreda george , " by providing a small amount of money but also by suggesting ways that individuals can turn around their lives . "
temeke council is unusual in tanzania in that it has three fully trained social welfare officers .
two-thirds of the 127 districts across the country have none at all .
the institute of social work has trained 120 people as para-social workers so far , but with the support of the us non-governmental organisation , american international health alliance -lrb- aiha -rrb- , intends to scale up the training programme to districts across tanzania .
it is hoped that a total of 5,000 new para-social workers will eventually be trained .
" it is a constant battle to meet the demand for social workers , " said aiha 's country director , hazel plunkett .
" of the 70 or 80 people who qualify as social workers each year less than 10 % are employed by the government as social welfare officers .
the salary is low and the work is hard , so most use the qualification as a stepping stone to another profession . "
there has been interest in the programme from other african countries including neighbouring mozambique , where social welfare is also in need of support .
there are concerns , however , that the push to get more para-social workers on to the streets is not sustainable once international donors leave .
" para-social work is a step in the right direction , " said diane swales of the united nation 's children agency , unicef , " but it needs an effective infrastructure and legislative framework and this needs to be provided by the government . "
para-social workers do not receive any extra payments for the additional help they give and so there is little incentive for them to work the extra hours .
and like the regular social workers , it is possible that they will use the training as a stepping stone to a better-paid job .
for the time being , people like asma yusuf and her family are among the few lucky people for whom the para-social worker has made a difference .
her son is ready to repay that support by excelling at school .
" i have the chance to study now and one day i hope to get a job which will help me to support my family , " he says .

there are concerns , however , that the push to get more para-social workers on to the streets is not sustainable once international donors leave .
" para-social work is a step in the right direction , " said diane swales of the united nation 's children agency , unicef , " but it needs an effective infrastructure and legislative framework and this needs to be provided by the government . "
para-social workers do not receive any extra payments for the additional help they give and so there is little incentive for them to work the extra hours .
and like the regular social workers , it is possible that they will use the training as a stepping stone to a better-paid job .
for the time being , people like asma yusuf and her family are among the few lucky people for whom the para-social worker has made a difference .
her son is ready to repay that support by excelling at school .
" i have the chance to study now and one day i hope to get a job which will help me to support my family , " he says .

it may be an everyday occurrence for families across the world , but 30-year-old asma is a widow with five children and no job and is one of the poorest people in an already poor neighbourhood : temeke , in dar es salaam .
her mud house with its disintegrating grass roof is conspicuous among her neighbours ' brick-built houses with corrugated iron roofs .
" before i was facing a miserable life .
i had little money , we had little food and i could n't afford to send my children to school , " she said .
" i did n't know how my family could survive . "
turned around asma says her life has turned round following the intervention and help of her local authority " i have been given books and a school uniform for my son .
he has been able to go to secondary school for the first time . "
the financial and material support from temeke council has addressed very immediate needs but social support has also been invaluable , she says .
" perhaps what has been most useful is the advice i have been given about how to look after my children without the help of an extended family . "
that advice has included a range of life skills : caring for her family , managing the small amount of money she makes from selling small fried bread rolls known as mandazi , as well as advice on family planning and hiv / aids prevention .
changing societies asma is one of the lucky few who have benefited from a system that is working well in one small area of dar es salaam , but which is unique in tanzania and could be copied by countries throughout africa .
the demand for social welfare support of this type is increasing across the continent , partly because of the number of children who are being orphaned by aids , but also because the migration of rural people to the city has led to a breakdown in family support structures .
temeke , with its population of 750,000 , is home to around 9,500 " most vulnerable children " -lrb- mvcs -rrb- , as they are known in development jargon : a 10 % increase on the previous year .
according to the institute of social work -lrb- isw -rrb- , tanzania needs at least 8,000 more social workers to meet the increasing demand .
its response has been to train existing community development officers and representatives of community-based and non-governmental organisations as so-called para-social workers .
" there are many professionals who are working at community level who frequently come into contact with mvcs , " says the institute 's judith bagachwa .
" we can give these people social work skills with which they can support people who would otherwise not receive any services . "
para-social worker alfreda george is a good example .
she is an agriculture field officer for temeke council providing nutrition advice and support for small urban agricultural projects .
haji hopes the chance to study will enable him to support his family following her training as a para-social worker by isw , she has been able to offer life-changing advice to the disadvantaged people she meets .
" we are able to make a real difference for people like asma and her children , " said alfreda george , " by providing a small amount of money but also by suggesting ways that individuals can turn around their lives . "
temeke council is unusual in tanzania in that it has three fully trained social welfare officers .
two-thirds of the 127 districts across the country have none at all .
the institute of social work has trained 120 people as para-social workers so far , but with the support of the us non-governmental organisation , american international health alliance -lrb- aiha -rrb- , intends to scale up the training programme to districts across tanzania .
it is hoped that a total of 5,000 new para-social workers will eventually be trained .
" it is a constant battle to meet the demand for social workers , " said aiha 's country director , hazel plunkett .
" of the 70 or 80 people who qualify as social workers each year less than 10 % are employed by the government as social welfare officers .
the salary is low and the work is hard , so most use the qualification as a stepping stone to another profession . "
there has been interest in the programme from other african countries including neighbouring mozambique , where social welfare is also in need of support .

the figures are the second set of annual results to be released by itv executive chairman michael grade .
the broadcaster has seen its shares face pressure over the past year .
they hit new lows in january and february .
itv has also been embroiled in the row about bskyb 's 17.9 % stake in the firm , and advertising worries .
' onscreen improvement ' but itv says it has now stabilised advertising revenues , and that it has been able to increase its television advertising revenues by nearly 2 % year-on-year for the first quarter of 2008 .
the company , home to coronation street and the x factor , also said that itv channels as a whole delivered their first viewing increase since the early 1990s .
the viewing share of the " itv family " of channels increased to 23.2 % from 23.1 % in 2006 .
" viewers that had deserted us are coming back , " mr grade told the bbc .
" you are not going to get a 10 % or 20 % increase in viewing numbers .
given that we had 10 or 15 years of declining share i will take this increase . "
the decline in advertising revenue at itv1 bottomed out , and was down by 4 % in 2007 compared with a 12 % drop in 2006 .
" with a much improved performance onscreen , we have countered the myth that itv is a business managing decline , " mr grade added .
he highlighted the show britain 's got talent as being one of itv 's successes of 2007 .
contract extension " in my first year back at itv , we put together a growth strategy for the business and strengthened the senior team , " mr grade said . "
the first priority for itv was to stem the decline " itv chairman michael grade check itv 's shares " the first priority for itv was to stem the decline .
we did more than that , delivering an increase in viewing to the itv family for the first time in over a decade . "
last week , it was announced that former bbc one controller peter fincham would join itv as director of television , replacing simon shaps .
that news came as mr grade agreed to stay in his role until 2010 , a year longer than expected .
his contract was originally due to expire in 2009 .
bskyb row in january , the government ruled that bskyb must reduce its holding in itv from the current level of 17.9 % to below 7.5 % and not take a seat on the itv board .
on 17 november 2006 , bskyb announced it had spent £ 940m buying 17.9 % of itv , but itv 's share price has dropped since then .
the deal effectively prevented cable operator ntl - which has since been renamed virgin media - from launching a takeover bid for itv .

and 85 % of those surveyed said they were positive about their first point of contact with gp surgeries .
but a quarter were dissatisfied with the ease of getting a convenient appointment with their gp and were not happy with hospital waiting times .
the assembly government said policies would become more " user focused " .
the living in wales survey questioned 7,500 people face-to-face on their views on services such as schools , the nhs and transport .
public service delivery minister andrew davies pledged to listen and learn , and translate the results into the way public services in wales are delivered in the future .
on the issue of transport , 44 % of people surveyed had used their local bus services in the previous 12 months and 80 % of those were satisfied overall .
around one third of households with children aged 2-5 years were using a local authority funded nursery or playgroup , the survey showed .
the majority were satisfied although only half expressed satisfaction about their involvement in decisions about their child 's nursery or playgroup .
overall , a majority of parents expressed positive views of their experience of their child 's primary school , although parents were least satisfied with the ease of getting their child to and from school .
on secondary schools , the majority of parents expressed positive views of their child 's experience .
however around a quarter of parents reported that they had no opportunity to participate in decision-making on the running of their child 's secondary school .
in terms of recycling , the survey found the majority of citizens -lrb- 75 % -rrb- had used facilities over the previous 12 months .
the main reasons for not using facilities were " there was no need " -lrb- 25 % -rrb- or " did n't have time " -lrb- 23 % -rrb- .
most respondents were positive about all aspects of their local sport and leisure facilities .
mr davies said there was still room for improvement and described the feedback the survey gave as a " very important part of the jigsaw by which we judge the quality of the standard that are provided by the public sector " .
he said : " there 's a lot to learn from this and it 's very important that we do listen to what people want .
there 's no point saying we 're providing high quality services if people do n't want them or feel they 're a high quality . "
he said the survey allowed a breakdown of the statistics .
" instead of looking at the people of wales as single group , it look at breaking it down on the basis of age , for example younger people often find it very difficult to find out about services or to feel that services are not what they want . "
he added that improving complaints procedures was akin to industry canvassing what customers thought of a firm 's products .
steve thomas , chief executive of the welsh local government association said the survey showed " local government can hold its head up high in the knowledge that we are getting it right " .
" local councils play a critical role in delivering vital frontline services to thousands of people within their communities and today 's survey shows that our efforts and approaches are paying off , " he said .

public service delivery minister andrew davies pledged to listen and learn , and translate the results into the way public services in wales are delivered in the future .
on the issue of transport , 44 % of people surveyed had used their local bus services in the previous 12 months and 80 % of those were satisfied overall .
schools were also among the topics covered in the poll around one third of households with children aged 2-5 years were using a local authority funded nursery or playgroup , the survey showed .
the majority were satisfied although only half expressed satisfaction about their involvement in decisions about their child 's nursery or playgroup .
overall , a majority of parents expressed positive views of their experience of their child 's primary school , although parents were least satisfied with the ease of getting their child to and from school .
on secondary schools , the majority of parents expressed positive views of their child 's experience .
however around a quarter of parents reported that they had no opportunity to participate in decision-making on the running of their child 's secondary school .
in terms of recycling , the survey found the majority of citizens -lrb- 75 % -rrb- had used facilities over the previous 12 months .
the main reasons for not using facilities were " there was no need " -lrb- 25 % -rrb- or " did n't have time " -lrb- 23 % -rrb- .
most respondents were positive about all aspects of their local sport and leisure facilities .
the survey will help make policy more ' customer focused ' mr davies said there was still room for improvement and described the feedback the survey gave as a " very important part of the jigsaw by which we judge the quality of the standard that are provided by the public sector " .
he said : " there 's a lot to learn from this and it 's very important that we do listen to what people want .
there 's no point saying we 're providing high quality services if people do n't want them or feel they 're a high quality . "
he said the survey allowed a breakdown of the statistics .
" instead of looking at the people of wales as single group , it look at breaking it down on the basis of age , for example younger people often find it very difficult to find out about services or to feel that services are not what they want . "
he added that improving complaints procedures was akin to industry canvassing what customers thought of a firm 's products .
steve thomas , chief executive of the welsh local government association said the survey showed " local government can hold its head up high in the knowledge that we are getting it right " .
" local councils play a critical role in delivering vital frontline services to thousands of people within their communities and today 's survey shows that our efforts and approaches are paying off , " he said .

ethical funds , so-called green funds , or dark -lrb- and light -rrb- green funds are just a few of the products now open to retail investors and , contrary to received wisdom , the performance of many of these funds is admirable .
however , there is a new type of fund which is also worth consideration , which encompasses many of the benefits of the ethical funds but combines them with a positive investment ethos - that of looking for sustainability .
although ethical funds are growing in popularity , investors may feel that the investment strategy of these offerings is somewhat negative .
ruling in , not ruling out ethical funds tend , after all , to be defined more by what they wo n't do than what they will .
for instance , an ethical fund will not invest in tobacco stocks , for instance , or the arms trade .
sustainable investing takes a more positive approach to these issues .
sustainable investing also avoids investing in companies which may have a negative impact on the environment , human health , safety and the quality of life .
it also entails investing in organisations which are positively involved in the social , economic , environmental and ethical issues that affect their business .
a top sustainable fund should not merely " screen out " companies whose activities are regarded as unsustainable ; it should actively seek out those firms that are identifying the key issues and , importantly , how they interact with each other in order so that they can understand how best to break new ground in social and environmental performance .

such pressures can come from social groups , government , non-governmental organisations or lobbyists .
new funds are investing in businesses that take the sustainability issues seriously .
a fund manager who is giving due consideration to the wider business risks should be applauded .
emotional and philanthropic responses aside , the net result for investors of focusing on sustainability seems to be better management control of the business , which is likely to lead to a better return on investment .
the appeal of a sustainable approach should be clear to investors .

celebrity pressure for instance , 10 years ago , it would not seem credible that every uk supermarket would see organic and fairtrade as a battle ground for market leadership but celebrity pressure from chefs such as hugh fearnley-whittingstall and jamie oliver are changing all that with high-profile tv shows .

for instance , an ethical fund will not invest in tobacco stocks , for instance , or the arms trade .
sustainable investing takes a more positive approach to these issues .
sustainable investing also avoids investing in companies which may have a negative impact on the environment , human health , safety and the quality of life .
it also entails investing in organisations which are positively involved in the social , economic , environmental and ethical issues that affect their business .
a top sustainable fund should not merely " screen out " companies whose activities are regarded as unsustainable ; it should actively seek out those firms that are identifying the key issues and , importantly , how they interact with each other in order so that they can understand how best to break new ground in social and environmental performance .
sustainability reports fund managers are now starting to use sustainability reports issued by companies to make investment decisions .
these reports are readily available from many large companies ' websites and sustainability reports should now be on retail investors ' radar as well .
it is not a case that one has to choose between investing according to values or investing to make a profit these reports highlight the risks and opportunities to a business of the possible impact of consumer pressure , regulatory pressure , international standards , and environmental and health demands .
such pressures can come from social groups , government , non-governmental organisations or lobbyists .
new funds are investing in businesses that take the sustainability issues seriously .
a fund manager who is giving due consideration to the wider business risks should be applauded .
emotional and philanthropic responses aside , the net result for investors of focusing on sustainability seems to be better management control of the business , which is likely to lead to a better return on investment .

a business that is assessing and adapting to external risks and pressures on an ongoing basis - and which tends to apply the latest technology to meet its business challenges - is likely to be well-suited to surviving in the modern world .
celebrity pressure for instance , 10 years ago , it would not seem credible that every uk supermarket would see organic and fairtrade as a battle ground for market leadership but celebrity pressure from chefs such as hugh fearnley-whittingstall and jamie oliver are changing all that with high-profile tv shows .
celebrity pressure has changed some attitudes supermarkets that are changing the way they work to meet these changing demands are showing a commitment to sustainable practices .

it is vital for companies , fund managers and investors to consider the potential risks to the future of the business in a proactive way .
identifying the risks allows companies to seize new opportunities and gain advantage over the competition .
sustainability gives us an indicator of how seriously a company , or indeed a fund , is taking those risks .
a fund manager who is aware of all the potential risks to a business should be one to watch .

scientists have shown that it is possible to recover the key that unscrambles data from a pc 's memory .
it was previously thought that data held in so-called " volatile memory " was only retained for a few seconds after the machine was switched off .
but the team found that data including encryption keys could be held and retrieved for up to several minutes .
" it was widely believed that when you cut the power to the computer that the information in the volatile memory would disappear , and what we found was that was not the case , " professor edward felten of the university of princeton told bbc world service 's digital planet programme .
volatile memory is typically used in random access memory -lrb- ram -rrb- , which is used as temporary storage for programs and data when the computer is switched on .
deep sleep disc encryption is the main method by which companies and governments protect sensitive information .
" the key to making it work is to keep the encryption key secret , " explained professor felten .
encryption has recently become a hot topic after a number of laptops containing personal records were lost or stolen . "
simply locking your screen or switching to ' suspend ' or ' hibernate ' mode will not provide adequate protection " edward felten " what we have found was that the encryption keys needed to access these encrypted files were available in the memory of laptops , " he said .
" the information was available for seconds or minutes . "
in theory , this is enough time for a hacker or attacker to retrieve the key from the memory chips .
" the real worry is that someone will get hold of your laptop either while it is turned on or while it is in sleeping or hibernation mode , " said professor felten .
in these modes the laptop is not running , but information is still stored in ram to allow it to " wake up " quickly .
" the person will get the laptop , cut the power and then re-attach the power , and by doing that will get access to the contents of memory - including the critical encryption keys . "
cool running switching the machine off and on is critical to any attack .
" when it comes out of sleep mode the operating system is there and it is trying to protect this data , " explained professor felten .
but a full power-down followed by a swift re-start removes this protection .
" by cutting the power and then bringing it back , the adversary can get rid of the operating system and get access directly to the memory . "
professor felten and his team found that cooling the laptop enhanced the retention of data in memory chips .
" the information stays in the memory for much longer - 10 minutes or more , " he said .
for example , where information stays in a computer for around 15 seconds under normal conditions , a laptop cooled to about -50c will keep information in its memory for 10 minutes or more .
professor felten said that the best way to protect a computer was to shut it down fully several minutes before going into any situation in which the machine 's physical security could be compromised .
" simply locking your screen or switching to ' suspend ' or ' hibernate ' mode will not provide adequate protection , " he added .
" it does cast some doubt on the value of encryption .
i think that over time the encryption products will adapt to this and they will find new ways of protecting information . "

but the team found that data including encryption keys could be held and retrieved for up to several minutes .
" it was widely believed that when you cut the power to the computer that the information in the volatile memory would disappear , and what we found was that was not the case , " professor edward felten of the university of princeton told bbc world service 's digital planet programme .
volatile memory is typically used in random access memory -lrb- ram -rrb- , which is used as temporary storage for programs and data when the computer is switched on .
deep sleep disc encryption is the main method by which companies and governments protect sensitive information .
" the key to making it work is to keep the encryption key secret , " explained professor felten .
encryption has recently become a hot topic after a number of laptops containing personal records were lost or stolen .
simply locking your screen or switching to ' suspend ' or ' hibernate ' mode will not provide adequate protection edward felten " what we have found was that the encryption keys needed to access these encrypted files were available in the memory of laptops , " he said .
" the information was available for seconds or minutes . "
in theory , this is enough time for a hacker or attacker to retrieve the key from the memory chips .
" the real worry is that someone will get hold of your laptop either while it is turned on or while it is in sleeping or hibernation mode , " said professor felten .
in these modes the laptop is not running , but information is still stored in ram to allow it to " wake up " quickly .
" the person will get the laptop , cut the power and then re-attach the power , and by doing that will get access to the contents of memory - including the critical encryption keys . "
cool running switching the machine off and on is critical to any attack .
" when it comes out of sleep mode the operating system is there and it is trying to protect this data , " explained professor felten .
but a full power-down followed by a swift re-start removes this protection .
" by cutting the power and then bringing it back , the adversary can get rid of the operating system and get access directly to the memory . "
professor felten and his team found that cooling the laptop enhanced the retention of data in memory chips .
" the information stays in the memory for much longer - 10 minutes or more , " he said .
for example , where information stays in a computer for around 15 seconds under normal conditions , a laptop cooled to about -50c will keep information in its memory for 10 minutes or more .
professor felten said that the best way to protect a computer was to shut it down fully several minutes before going into any situation in which the machine 's physical security could be compromised .
" simply locking your screen or switching to ' suspend ' or ' hibernate ' mode will not provide adequate protection , " he added .
" it does cast some doubt on the value of encryption .
i think that over time the encryption products will adapt to this and they will find new ways of protecting information . "

" the information was available for seconds or minutes . "
in theory , this is enough time for a hacker or attacker to retrieve the key from the memory chips .
" the real worry is that someone will get hold of your laptop either while it is turned on or while it is in sleeping or hibernation mode , " said professor felten .
in these modes the laptop is not running , but information is still stored in ram to allow it to " wake up " quickly .
" the person will get the laptop , cut the power and then re-attach the power , and by doing that will get access to the contents of memory - including the critical encryption keys . "
cool running switching the machine off and on is critical to any attack .
" when it comes out of sleep mode the operating system is there and it is trying to protect this data , " explained professor felten .
but a full power-down followed by a swift re-start removes this protection .
" by cutting the power and then bringing it back , the adversary can get rid of the operating system and get access directly to the memory . "
professor felten and his team found that cooling the laptop enhanced the retention of data in memory chips .
" the information stays in the memory for much longer - 10 minutes or more , " he said .
for example , where information stays in a computer for around 15 seconds under normal conditions , a laptop cooled to about -50c will keep information in its memory for 10 minutes or more .
professor felten said that the best way to protect a computer was to shut it down fully several minutes before going into any situation in which the machine 's physical security could be compromised .
" simply locking your screen or switching to ' suspend ' or ' hibernate ' mode will not provide adequate protection , " he added .
" it does cast some doubt on the value of encryption .
i think that over time the encryption products will adapt to this and they will find new ways of protecting information . "

scientists have shown that it is possible to recover the key that unscrambles data from a pc 's memory .
it was previously thought that data held in so-called " volatile memory " was only retained for a few seconds after the machine was switched off .
but the team found that data including encryption keys could be held and retrieved for up to several minutes .
" it was widely believed that when you cut the power to the computer that the information in the volatile memory would disappear , and what we found was that was not the case , " professor edward felten of the university of princeton told bbc world service 's digital planet programme .
volatile memory is typically used in random access memory -lrb- ram -rrb- , which is used as temporary storage for programs and data when the computer is switched on .
deep sleep disc encryption is the main method by which companies and governments protect sensitive information .
" the key to making it work is to keep the encryption key secret , " explained professor felten .

last year a pair of hen harriers raised five chicks at a nest in tynedale , which was guarded 24-hours a day .
now the rspb and forestry commission are preparing a similar exercise in the hope the harriers - one of the uk 's rarest birds of prey - will return .
a team of volunteers has been trained to take up posts if the birds are seen .
' spectacular bird ' phil curtis , who is leading the protection project , said : " harriers can travel over large distances and can turn up just about anywhere , so we are appealing for the help of people in the north east to help us by watching out for these special birds . "
tom dearnley , ecologist with the forestry commission , added : " we hope that the harriers will return to nest in tynedale again this year , and if they do we will be ready to protect them .
" hen harriers are a spectacular bird of prey and the efforts of so many people to protect the nest last year made for a great success story . "
although research has shown that the heather moors of england should have around 200 pairs of nesting harriers each year , only around a dozen pairs are usually successful in raising chicks .
illegal killing or deliberate disturbance is the main reason that hen harriers are absent from almost all areas of suitable moorland in northern england .

the advertising standards agency said the ads broke rules on truthfulness , guarantees and substantiation , after a complaint was brought by rival ryanair .
the adverts stated : " book by friday and if you find it cheaper elsewhere we 'll refund double the difference . "
but it only applied to a restricted selection and number of flights .
the deal was only available on flights leaving within an hour of easyjet services , out of the same airport and to the same destination as their flights .
the asa has said easyjet can not re-use the adverts , which appeared on the internet and in newspapers during summer 2007 .
' misleading ' the luton-based budget airline said the terms and conditions were stated on each advertisement and were not misleading , and said many passengers had taken advantage of the offer .
however , the asa ruled : " while the design and layout of the ads gave the impression the double the difference refund was easy to obtain , the very restricting terms and conditions suggested it was not .
" we also noted easyjet had not sent sufficient evidence to show customers had been able to take up the offer .
we therefore concluded the ads were misleading . "
ryanair had also complained that other adverts implied that easyjet 's flights were always cheaper than those of their rivals .
but the asa ruled these adverts did not imply easyjet 's fares were always the cheapest , as passengers had to find a lower price on a comparable flight to take advantage of this particular offer .

the adverts stated : " book by friday and if you find it cheaper elsewhere we 'll refund double the difference . "
but it only applied to a restricted selection and number of flights .
the deal was only available on flights leaving within an hour of easyjet services , out of the same airport and to the same destination as their flights .
the asa has said easyjet can not re-use the adverts , which appeared on the internet and in newspapers during summer 2007 .
' misleading ' the luton-based budget airline said the terms and conditions were stated on each advertisement and were not misleading , and said many passengers had taken advantage of the offer .
however , the asa ruled : " while the design and layout of the ads gave the impression the double the difference refund was easy to obtain , the very restricting terms and conditions suggested it was not .
" we also noted easyjet had not sent sufficient evidence to show customers had been able to take up the offer .
we therefore concluded the ads were misleading . "
ryanair had also complained that other adverts implied that easyjet 's flights were always cheaper than those of their rivals .
but the asa ruled these adverts did not imply easyjet 's fares were always the cheapest , as passengers had to find a lower price on a comparable flight to take advantage of this particular offer .

an australian team claims the little people were not a new human species , but modern humans with a form of dwarfism caused by poor nutrition .
in 2004 , international researchers announced the discovery of the ancient remains in the liang bua cave .
there has been debate since then over whether the bones are from diseased humans or a new human " cousin " .
the latest theory , published in the scientific journal proceedings of the royal society b , claims the hobbits were true humans , but did not grow to normal size because of environmental factors .
the conclusions in this paper are not supported by the facts professor peter brown dr peter obendorf from the school of applied science at rmit university , melbourne , and colleagues , believe the little people developed a dwarfism condition because of severe nutritional deficiencies .
environmental link severe iodine deficiency in pregnancy can cause people to grow little more than a metre tall with bone characteristics very similar to those of the flores hobbits , said dr obendorf .
the hobbit skull -lrb- left -rrb- compared with a modern human he added : " our research suggests that these fossils are not a new species but rather the remains of human hunter-gatherers that suffered from this condition . "
they came to this conclusion after studying images of skulls of the flores fossils .
anatomical features were compared with museum specimens of humans suffering from a condition known as congenital hypothyroidism .
the australian group did not examine the original fossils .
the hypothesis has been described as " sheer speculation " by some experts , including professor peter brown of the university of new england in armidale , australia , one of the original members of the team that discovered the remains .
" the conclusions in this paper are not supported by the facts , " he said .
" the authors have not examined the original fossil , have little and no experience with fossil hominids and depend upon data obtained by others . "
genetic clue dr jeremy austin , deputy director of the australian centre for ancient dna at adelaide university , said genetic data might provide the " casting vote " in the debate .
it would clarify the evolutionary relationship between the hobbit -lrb- homo floresiensis -rrb- and modern humans , he said .
genetic data has not been forthcoming so far , he admitted , mainly due to poor preservation of the liang bua material and extensive contamination by modern human dna of material recovered from the site .
" collection of fresh , better preserved , hobbit remains using strict anti-contamination measures currently is the best hope for testing the status of homo floresiensis using genetic data , " said dr austin .
the little people were nicknamed hobbits after the fictional creatures in the writings of jrr tolkien .
they were about a metre tall , with a brain about the size of a chimpanzee 's .

" the authors have not examined the original fossil , have little and no experience with fossil hominids and depend upon data obtained by others . "
genetic clue dr jeremy austin , deputy director of the australian centre for ancient dna at adelaide university , said genetic data might provide the " casting vote " in the debate .
it would clarify the evolutionary relationship between the hobbit -lrb- homo floresiensis -rrb- and modern humans , he said .
genetic data has not been forthcoming so far , he admitted , mainly due to poor preservation of the liang bua material and extensive contamination by modern human dna of material recovered from the site .
" collection of fresh , better preserved , hobbit remains using strict anti-contamination measures currently is the best hope for testing the status of homo floresiensis using genetic data , " said dr austin .
the little people were nicknamed hobbits after the fictional creatures in the writings of jrr tolkien .
they were about a metre tall , with a brain about the size of a chimpanzee 's .

our level of happiness throughout life is strongly influenced by the genes with which we were born , say experts .
an edinburgh university study of identical and non-identical twins suggests genes may control half the personality traits keeping us happy .
the other half is linked to lifestyle , career and relationships .
however , another expert said despite the research in the journal psychological science , we can still train ourselves to be more content .
together with life and liberty , the pursuit of happiness is a core human desire dr alexander weiss university of edinburgh psychologists have developed several methods to assess a person 's personality type - and even their level of happiness .
the edinburgh study , in conjunction with researchers at the institute for medical research in queensland , australia , looked at results from 900 pairs of twins .
the idea behind twin studies is that , because identical twins are genetically exactly the same , while fraternal twins are not , it is possible , by comparing the results from the two groups to calculate how strongly influenced a particular trait is by genetics .
in this case , the researchers looked for people who tended not to worry , and who were sociable and conscientious .
all three of these separate characteristics have been linked by other research to an overall sense of happiness or well-being .
the differences between the results from the identical and fraternal twins suggested that these traits were influenced up to 50 % by genetic factors .
positive psychology dr alexander weiss , from edinburgh 's school of philosophy , psychology and language sciences , who led the research , said : " together with life and liberty , the pursuit of happiness is a core human desire .
" although happiness is subject to a wide range of external influences we have found there is a heritable component of happiness which can be entirely explained by genetic architecture of personality . "
the science of happiness is a growing field , with demand from both the public and industry for insights into emotional wellbeing .
the centre for applied positive psychology promotes research into techniques for boosting personal contentment .
dr alex linley , from the centre , said that even though other studies supported the genetic argument , it was wrong for anyone to think that nature had dealt them a fixed hand in happiness terms .
he said : " what it means is that , rather than a single point , people have a range of possible levels of happiness - and it is perfectly possible to influence this with techniques that are empirically proven to work .
" simple things , like listing your strengths and using them in new ways every day , or keeping a journal where you write down , every night , three things that you are grateful for , have been shown to deliver improvements . "

former students claim they have overpaid loan repayments due to the pay-as-you-earn system in place to collect the debt .
they also say they have started paying back their loans before they earn enough .
the national union of students says the repayment system is not fit for purpose but hm revenue and customs says it is up to graduates to monitor payments .
thousands of students every year take out the loans to help them pay university fees and living expenses while they are studying .
many of them pay back their loans through the pay-as-you-earn system after they graduate .
when they begin to earn more than £ 15,000 per year , a percentage is taken from their wages according to how much they earn .
what we are seeing is a catalogue of bad administration ben gray , president of the national union of students in wales at the end of each tax year employers send the money collected onto hm revenue and custom -lrb- hmrc -rrb- which collects student payments on behalf of the student loans company .
up to eight months afterwards an annual statement is sent out to borrowers detailing how much money has been received .
but because hmrc is not told how much the total loan was to start with , it keeps taking money until instructed by the students loans company or borrower to stop .
the graduates claim it can be difficult to keep track of how much they have paid , especially if they do not keep their payslips or change their job .
ben gray , president of the national union of students in wales , said the student loans repayment system should be as transparent , flawless and flexible as possible .
" instead what we are seeing is a catalogue of bad administration , " he said .
teacher rhian morgan from swansea had been paying back her £ 16,000 debt despite only working in a part time job .
but in her statement from the student loans company at the end of the tax year in 2003 , it said that no payments had been made .
delays the student loans company said ms morgan 's was a highly unusual case and they would investigate it further .
another graduate found that money was still being deducted from her monthly wage for seven months after her loan had been paid off .
the student loans company and hmrc said it recognised there could be delays in getting accurate information out to borrowers because of the way the tax system works .
derek ross , deputy chief executive of the student loans company said changes were being made to the repayment system to make it easier for borrowers .
this includes an online repayment site which would allow borrowers to view their current statement and calculate an up-to-date balance .
the student loans company is also investigating whether graduates who are entering the final years of repayment could opt-out of the tax system and pay them directly to avoid unnecessary overpayments .
