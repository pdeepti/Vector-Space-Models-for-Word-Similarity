" there are plenty of women in these happy crowds , which refutes once and for all the sexist reputation of our game , " said uefa boss michel platini earlier in the tournament . uefa spokesman wolfgang eichler also spoke of " a tendency towards a growing number of women in the fan zones and stadiums " with a german football spokesman speaking in more general terms of " growing interest of women in football - including the bundesliga . " a combination of reasons the end of hooliganism in stadiums , greater comfort there , as well as football turning from a simple sports competition to an event are listed as some factors which attract women to the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian fans at the 2006 world cup the trend was first observed at the 2006 world cup - which like euro saw a figure of almost 50 percent women in the stadiums - and it now even covers the merchandising sector . " at least half of our shoppers are women , " said one member of the official euro fan shop in vienna .
" while men simply buy the xl shirt of their favorite team women want some advice as far as size and color are concerned . " this shows a different approach of the genders , which is also confirmed by nicole selmer , author of the book " watching the boys play . " " male and female football fans have a lot in common , but there are also differences .
women make more personal remarks about players such as ' he looks good ' or ' he can even put three sentences together , " ' said selmer . not just the babe factor she insisted this does n't mean that women do n't have a clue about football and were only interested in the looks of players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sex appeal of players like cristiano ronaldo does n't keep the women away , but it 's not the only reason they 're fans in germany , a poll by the allensbach institute conducted ahead of euro seems to confirms this as well , with 59 percent of the women saying they are really into the game when germany plays - as opposed to 57 percent of the men . another poll , from the german elitepartner online dating service , also reveals that 34 per cent of the men polled consider football-crazy women sexy . " men like it when women love the sport .
they hope for football evenings with them , " said elitepartner psychologist lisa fischbach . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .

" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 21.06.2008 chart-busting chants turn modest monks into stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks say chanting is part of their everyday lives move over madonna , because a group of modest monastery monks from austria have rocketed into the top 10 in germany 's charts with an album of gregorian chants . the album " chant - music for paradise " by the cistercian monks of stift heiligenkreuz was released earlier this month and has already reaped gold for universal music - to the utter amazement of the monks themselves .
many of them had never even heard of universal until the label turned them into gold-winning recording stars overnight .
" the whole thing with the recording happened like a miracle , " said father karl , who almost inadvertently turned his monastery , nestled in the vienna woods , into one of the hottest venues on youtube .
he and his fellow monks had posted a youtube video of their chants for the benefit of shut-ins and invalids who could not attend mass .
he had no idea that it would become an internet hit .
" i can not believe this whole story , " he told interviewers .
" i got this e-mail , and there were only two words , ' schnell , schnell -lrb- quick , quick -rrb- , ' and there was a link .
i clicked on the link and found that they were looking for the most beautiful sacred voices . "
last-minute application struck gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks stipulated that their album be recorded in the monastery " they " turned out to be universal music looking for new talent .
" i just answered it and sent them a link to our homepage where we have an example of gregorian chants , " explained father karl .
" it was also the last day for applications . "
he admitted that he thought nothing would come of it .
" after all , our homepage is rather pathetic , " he said .
even so , the online video of the chanting monks had already gotten 80,000 hits at that point .
since the release of the album , the video has registered twice that many hits .
next thing they knew , studio executives were handing them a recording contract and photographers and a film crew were setting up to shoot a professional quality music video to coincide with the album release .
the video was shot in the monastery itself .
that was one of the stipulations imposed by the cistercian monks .
they refused to be flown to london to record the album in a studio .
funeral chants set the mood the monastery choirmaster , father simeon , selected 17 monks with the finest voices for the actual recording session .
recording execs were a bit taken aback when father simeon informed them he had selected a number of funerary chants owing to the recent deaths of one or two monks .
he insisted it would be inappropriate for the brothers to be expected to do upbeat , joyful chants under the circumstances .
in addition , the monastery ruled out any publicity tour or tv appearances .
the funeral dirges turned out to be a stroke of genius since the soothing , gentle tones proved a chart-busting hit in germany .
it is pure " chill-out " music to untrained ears .
father karl said he is not bothered by the way the chants are received by lay listeners .
chanting -lrb- and internet -rrb- part of everyday life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet and mobile phones are also part of the monks ' daily lives " it 's our way of praying and meditating , " he explained .
" we get up early and begin chanting at 5:15 in the morning .
we intersperse chanting with working all day .
that 's what we do .
" how the music comes across to other people is in the hands of god , " he added .
it is the biggest media exposure the monastery has had in its 875-year history , and father karl concedes that it is all a bit too much for some of the older brothers to cope with .
" i 've been told to refrain from posting the chart standings on the bulletin board next to the dining hall , " he said .
but the royalties for the monastery 's earthly work are welcome .
" it is a veritable gift from god , " he said of the sudden influx of cash .
" we desperately need this money for our work in training monks from vietnam , sri lanka and africa . "
actually , the monks are not as out of touch as outsiders might think .
most of them have their own laptops and mobile phones , which they use to text each other so as to keep in touch when in far-flung parts of the monastery .
e-mail and internet access and youtube are important parts of their lives .
" after all , " said father karl , " st. benedict wisely said in the sixth century that every monk must have stylus and parchment .
we have cyber-stylus and cyber-parchment .
but the idea is the same . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after all , our homepage is rather pathetic , " he said .
even so , the online video of the chanting monks had already gotten 80,000 hits at that point .
since the release of the album , the video has registered twice that many hits .
next thing they knew , studio executives were handing them a recording contract and photographers and a film crew were setting up to shoot a professional quality music video to coincide with the album release .
the video was shot in the monastery itself .
that was one of the stipulations imposed by the cistercian monks .
they refused to be flown to london to record the album in a studio .
funeral chants set the mood the monastery choirmaster , father simeon , selected 17 monks with the finest voices for the actual recording session .
recording execs were a bit taken aback when father simeon informed them he had selected a number of funerary chants owing to the recent deaths of one or two monks .
he insisted it would be inappropriate for the brothers to be expected to do upbeat , joyful chants under the circumstances .
in addition , the monastery ruled out any publicity tour or tv appearances .
the funeral dirges turned out to be a stroke of genius since the soothing , gentle tones proved a chart-busting hit in germany .
it is pure " chill-out " music to untrained ears .
father karl said he is not bothered by the way the chants are received by lay listeners .
chanting -lrb- and internet -rrb- part of everyday life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet and mobile phones are also part of the monks ' daily lives " it 's our way of praying and meditating , " he explained .
" we get up early and begin chanting at 5:15 in the morning .
we intersperse chanting with working all day .
that 's what we do .
" how the music comes across to other people is in the hands of god , " he added .
it is the biggest media exposure the monastery has had in its 875-year history , and father karl concedes that it is all a bit too much for some of the older brothers to cope with .
" i 've been told to refrain from posting the chart standings on the bulletin board next to the dining hall , " he said .
but the royalties for the monastery 's earthly work are welcome .
" it is a veritable gift from god , " he said of the sudden influx of cash .
" we desperately need this money for our work in training monks from vietnam , sri lanka and africa . "
actually , the monks are not as out of touch as outsiders might think .
most of them have their own laptops and mobile phones , which they use to text each other so as to keep in touch when in far-flung parts of the monastery .
e-mail and internet access and youtube are important parts of their lives .
" after all , " said father karl , " st. benedict wisely said in the sixth century that every monk must have stylus and parchment .
we have cyber-stylus and cyber-parchment .
but the idea is the same . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .
our people can celebrate with us .

late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .

" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .

croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .
our people can celebrate with us .
if our people are proud of us then we are proud of our people . " croatia coach slaven bilic put a brave face on defeat , saying turkey 's last-gasp equalizer was " a dream goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senturk got in the last kick of the game " it is unbelievable .
that is why football is the best sport in the world , " he said before adding : " the last two minutes were unbelievable .
this will probably haunt me for the rest of my life . "
late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .
" now anything can happen .
if we carry on like this and believe in ourselves then a lot can happen . " the late drama made up for an unattractive first 90 minutes in which croatia enjoyed the best of the opportunities . after the high-class first quarter-final between germany and portugal the previous evening in basel , the 51,428 capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion had to endure a dull and disjointed game .
turkish omissions terim could perhaps excuse his side 's lack of cohesion after injuries and suspension forced him to reshuffle .
there was a new look to the defense , with emre asik and gokhan zan in the center , while veteran keeper rustu was recalled in place of suspended volkan demirel , who will also miss the semi-final unless his appeal against a two-match ban is upheld on monday . turkey will also be without arda turan , tuncay sanli and emre asik , who received their second booking of the tournament , while nihat kahveci , who was substituted with an injury , must be doubtful . terim said he had not yet thought about the players missing for the next game .
" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia thought they had a sure thing for a while turkey rarely got forward after the break but remained stubborn in defense and croatia , who had looked so inventive in defeating germany 2-1 , found it hard to create any danger . olic and ivan rakitic had opportunities and a free-kick outside the box from darijo srna six minutes from time was well saved by rustu . the 35-year-old keeper , turkey 's most-capped player in his 117th game , had experienced some uncertain moments but then thwarted modric from close range in the final minute to take the game into extra-time .
croatia thought they were through croatian fans in the stadium , who had been lighting flares in the stands , raised the noise levels in the extra period after turkey began to look more enterprising , and semih fired over the bar before sanli narrowly shot wide of the post . but when rustu left his goal but failed to get the ball near the byline ahead of modric , substitute klasnic took full advantage to head modric 's cross into the empty net . but there was still time for rustu to make amends for the error as it was his long ball downfield which eventually broke to semih to blast the ball into the top corner of the net . until that moment , croatia were already eyeing up a return match with germany in the semi-final in basel next wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic missed his chance but perhaps shocked by semih 's equalizer , modric and rakitic both missed the goal completely from the spot while srna converted his and substitute mladen petric saw rustu save his effort . turan , semih and altintop all converted their penalties for turkey to secure a remarkable victory . " this is football , you should never give up until the end , until the referee blows the final whistle , " said terim .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : match reports spain overwhelm russia to set up final date with germany spain beat italy on penalties to book semi-final spot germany beat turkey 3-2 in dramatic fashion to reach final hiddink leads russia to stunning win over dutch euro 2008 -pipe- 21.06.2008 turkey progress to semi-finals after stunning win over croatia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeper rustu was the star turkey defeated croatia in a penalty shoot-out following a remarkable last few minutes of extra-time in vienna friday to reach the semi-finals of the european championships and a meeting with record champions germany . the victory came after a dramatic climax to the extra-time period , which was preceded by a less entertaining , goalless 90 minutes .
croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .
our people can celebrate with us .
if our people are proud of us then we are proud of our people . " croatia coach slaven bilic put a brave face on defeat , saying turkey 's last-gasp equalizer was " a dream goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senturk got in the last kick of the game " it is unbelievable .
that is why football is the best sport in the world , " he said before adding : " the last two minutes were unbelievable .
this will probably haunt me for the rest of my life . "
late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .
" now anything can happen .
if we carry on like this and believe in ourselves then a lot can happen . " the late drama made up for an unattractive first 90 minutes in which croatia enjoyed the best of the opportunities . after the high-class first quarter-final between germany and portugal the previous evening in basel , the 51,428 capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion had to endure a dull and disjointed game .
turkish omissions terim could perhaps excuse his side 's lack of cohesion after injuries and suspension forced him to reshuffle .
there was a new look to the defense , with emre asik and gokhan zan in the center , while veteran keeper rustu was recalled in place of suspended volkan demirel , who will also miss the semi-final unless his appeal against a two-match ban is upheld on monday . turkey will also be without arda turan , tuncay sanli and emre asik , who received their second booking of the tournament , while nihat kahveci , who was substituted with an injury , must be doubtful . terim said he had not yet thought about the players missing for the next game .
" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia thought they had a sure thing for a while turkey rarely got forward after the break but remained stubborn in defense and croatia , who had looked so inventive in defeating germany 2-1 , found it hard to create any danger . olic and ivan rakitic had opportunities and a free-kick outside the box from darijo srna six minutes from time was well saved by rustu . the 35-year-old keeper , turkey 's most-capped player in his 117th game , had experienced some uncertain moments but then thwarted modric from close range in the final minute to take the game into extra-time .
croatia thought they were through croatian fans in the stadium , who had been lighting flares in the stands , raised the noise levels in the extra period after turkey began to look more enterprising , and semih fired over the bar before sanli narrowly shot wide of the post . but when rustu left his goal but failed to get the ball near the byline ahead of modric , substitute klasnic took full advantage to head modric 's cross into the empty net . but there was still time for rustu to make amends for the error as it was his long ball downfield which eventually broke to semih to blast the ball into the top corner of the net . until that moment , croatia were already eyeing up a return match with germany in the semi-final in basel next wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic missed his chance but perhaps shocked by semih 's equalizer , modric and rakitic both missed the goal completely from the spot while srna converted his and substitute mladen petric saw rustu save his effort . turan , semih and altintop all converted their penalties for turkey to secure a remarkable victory . " this is football , you should never give up until the end , until the referee blows the final whistle , " said terim .

croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .
our people can celebrate with us .
if our people are proud of us then we are proud of our people . " croatia coach slaven bilic put a brave face on defeat , saying turkey 's last-gasp equalizer was " a dream goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senturk got in the last kick of the game " it is unbelievable .
that is why football is the best sport in the world , " he said before adding : " the last two minutes were unbelievable .
this will probably haunt me for the rest of my life . "
late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .
" now anything can happen .
if we carry on like this and believe in ourselves then a lot can happen . " the late drama made up for an unattractive first 90 minutes in which croatia enjoyed the best of the opportunities . after the high-class first quarter-final between germany and portugal the previous evening in basel , the 51,428 capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion had to endure a dull and disjointed game .
turkish omissions terim could perhaps excuse his side 's lack of cohesion after injuries and suspension forced him to reshuffle .
there was a new look to the defense , with emre asik and gokhan zan in the center , while veteran keeper rustu was recalled in place of suspended volkan demirel , who will also miss the semi-final unless his appeal against a two-match ban is upheld on monday . turkey will also be without arda turan , tuncay sanli and emre asik , who received their second booking of the tournament , while nihat kahveci , who was substituted with an injury , must be doubtful . terim said he had not yet thought about the players missing for the next game .
" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .

it 's thought another 1,000 troops could be deployed . jung wants to increase german deployment in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- from the current upper limit of 3,500 . media reports have said the figure could rise to 4,500 .
a defense ministry spokesman said jung would make clear the exact number at the end of next week . jung said in a radio interview saturday that any increase in troop strength would be used for training and civil reconstruction projects . " we want to increase training three-fold .
next year we want to train 7,500 afghan troops .
to achieve this we need to formulate a new upper limit for our mandate which will give german troops greater flexibility , " he told german public radio . focus on the north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung jung stressed earlier that germany would continue to focus its efforts on the relatively peaceful north of the country , where it will be providing the quick reaction force from early july , taking over from norway . the current german mandate for its troops runs out in mid-october , when parliament must approve a renewal . the annual renewal usually receives broad parliamentary backing , with only the socialist left party firmly opposed . a majority of the population opposes the deployment .
a poll in february showed 85 percent of the 1,001 surveyed opposed to sending german troops to the volatile south of the country .
germany has come under pressure from its nato allies to increase its efforts in afghanistan , and in particular to provide combat troops to assist the us , british , canadian and dutch forces fighting taliban insurgents in the embattled south . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 21.06.2008 chart-busting chants turn modest monks into stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks say chanting is part of their everyday lives move over madonna , because a group of modest monastery monks from austria have rocketed into the top 10 in germany 's charts with an album of gregorian chants . the album " chant - music for paradise " by the cistercian monks of stift heiligenkreuz was released earlier this month and has already reaped gold for universal music - to the utter amazement of the monks themselves .
many of them had never even heard of universal until the label turned them into gold-winning recording stars overnight .
" the whole thing with the recording happened like a miracle , " said father karl , who almost inadvertently turned his monastery , nestled in the vienna woods , into one of the hottest venues on youtube .
he and his fellow monks had posted a youtube video of their chants for the benefit of shut-ins and invalids who could not attend mass .
he had no idea that it would become an internet hit .
" i can not believe this whole story , " he told interviewers .
" i got this e-mail , and there were only two words , ' schnell , schnell -lrb- quick , quick -rrb- , ' and there was a link .
i clicked on the link and found that they were looking for the most beautiful sacred voices . "
last-minute application struck gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks stipulated that their album be recorded in the monastery " they " turned out to be universal music looking for new talent .
" i just answered it and sent them a link to our homepage where we have an example of gregorian chants , " explained father karl .
" it was also the last day for applications . "
he admitted that he thought nothing would come of it .
" after all , our homepage is rather pathetic , " he said .
even so , the online video of the chanting monks had already gotten 80,000 hits at that point .
since the release of the album , the video has registered twice that many hits .
next thing they knew , studio executives were handing them a recording contract and photographers and a film crew were setting up to shoot a professional quality music video to coincide with the album release .
the video was shot in the monastery itself .
that was one of the stipulations imposed by the cistercian monks .
they refused to be flown to london to record the album in a studio .
funeral chants set the mood the monastery choirmaster , father simeon , selected 17 monks with the finest voices for the actual recording session .
recording execs were a bit taken aback when father simeon informed them he had selected a number of funerary chants owing to the recent deaths of one or two monks .
he insisted it would be inappropriate for the brothers to be expected to do upbeat , joyful chants under the circumstances .
in addition , the monastery ruled out any publicity tour or tv appearances .
the funeral dirges turned out to be a stroke of genius since the soothing , gentle tones proved a chart-busting hit in germany .
it is pure " chill-out " music to untrained ears .
father karl said he is not bothered by the way the chants are received by lay listeners .
chanting -lrb- and internet -rrb- part of everyday life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet and mobile phones are also part of the monks ' daily lives " it 's our way of praying and meditating , " he explained .
" we get up early and begin chanting at 5:15 in the morning .
we intersperse chanting with working all day .
that 's what we do .
" how the music comes across to other people is in the hands of god , " he added .
it is the biggest media exposure the monastery has had in its 875-year history , and father karl concedes that it is all a bit too much for some of the older brothers to cope with .
" i 've been told to refrain from posting the chart standings on the bulletin board next to the dining hall , " he said .
but the royalties for the monastery 's earthly work are welcome .
" it is a veritable gift from god , " he said of the sudden influx of cash .
" we desperately need this money for our work in training monks from vietnam , sri lanka and africa . "
actually , the monks are not as out of touch as outsiders might think .
most of them have their own laptops and mobile phones , which they use to text each other so as to keep in touch when in far-flung parts of the monastery .
e-mail and internet access and youtube are important parts of their lives .
" after all , " said father karl , " st. benedict wisely said in the sixth century that every monk must have stylus and parchment .
we have cyber-stylus and cyber-parchment .
but the idea is the same . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .
our people can celebrate with us .
if our people are proud of us then we are proud of our people . " croatia coach slaven bilic put a brave face on defeat , saying turkey 's last-gasp equalizer was " a dream goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senturk got in the last kick of the game " it is unbelievable .
that is why football is the best sport in the world , " he said before adding : " the last two minutes were unbelievable .
this will probably haunt me for the rest of my life . "
late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .
" now anything can happen .
if we carry on like this and believe in ourselves then a lot can happen . " the late drama made up for an unattractive first 90 minutes in which croatia enjoyed the best of the opportunities . after the high-class first quarter-final between germany and portugal the previous evening in basel , the 51,428 capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion had to endure a dull and disjointed game .
turkish omissions terim could perhaps excuse his side 's lack of cohesion after injuries and suspension forced him to reshuffle .
there was a new look to the defense , with emre asik and gokhan zan in the center , while veteran keeper rustu was recalled in place of suspended volkan demirel , who will also miss the semi-final unless his appeal against a two-match ban is upheld on monday . turkey will also be without arda turan , tuncay sanli and emre asik , who received their second booking of the tournament , while nihat kahveci , who was substituted with an injury , must be doubtful . terim said he had not yet thought about the players missing for the next game .
" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia thought they had a sure thing for a while turkey rarely got forward after the break but remained stubborn in defense and croatia , who had looked so inventive in defeating germany 2-1 , found it hard to create any danger . olic and ivan rakitic had opportunities and a free-kick outside the box from darijo srna six minutes from time was well saved by rustu . the 35-year-old keeper , turkey 's most-capped player in his 117th game , had experienced some uncertain moments but then thwarted modric from close range in the final minute to take the game into extra-time .
croatia thought they were through croatian fans in the stadium , who had been lighting flares in the stands , raised the noise levels in the extra period after turkey began to look more enterprising , and semih fired over the bar before sanli narrowly shot wide of the post . but when rustu left his goal but failed to get the ball near the byline ahead of modric , substitute klasnic took full advantage to head modric 's cross into the empty net . but there was still time for rustu to make amends for the error as it was his long ball downfield which eventually broke to semih to blast the ball into the top corner of the net . until that moment , croatia were already eyeing up a return match with germany in the semi-final in basel next wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic missed his chance but perhaps shocked by semih 's equalizer , modric and rakitic both missed the goal completely from the spot while srna converted his and substitute mladen petric saw rustu save his effort . turan , semih and altintop all converted their penalties for turkey to secure a remarkable victory . " this is football , you should never give up until the end , until the referee blows the final whistle , " said terim .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 21.06.2008 chart-busting chants turn modest monks into stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks say chanting is part of their everyday lives move over madonna , because a group of modest monastery monks from austria have rocketed into the top 10 in germany 's charts with an album of gregorian chants . the album " chant - music for paradise " by the cistercian monks of stift heiligenkreuz was released earlier this month and has already reaped gold for universal music - to the utter amazement of the monks themselves .
many of them had never even heard of universal until the label turned them into gold-winning recording stars overnight .
" the whole thing with the recording happened like a miracle , " said father karl , who almost inadvertently turned his monastery , nestled in the vienna woods , into one of the hottest venues on youtube .
he and his fellow monks had posted a youtube video of their chants for the benefit of shut-ins and invalids who could not attend mass .
he had no idea that it would become an internet hit .
" i can not believe this whole story , " he told interviewers .
" i got this e-mail , and there were only two words , ' schnell , schnell -lrb- quick , quick -rrb- , ' and there was a link .
i clicked on the link and found that they were looking for the most beautiful sacred voices . "
last-minute application struck gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks stipulated that their album be recorded in the monastery " they " turned out to be universal music looking for new talent .
" i just answered it and sent them a link to our homepage where we have an example of gregorian chants , " explained father karl .
" it was also the last day for applications . "
he admitted that he thought nothing would come of it .
" after all , our homepage is rather pathetic , " he said .
even so , the online video of the chanting monks had already gotten 80,000 hits at that point .
since the release of the album , the video has registered twice that many hits .
next thing they knew , studio executives were handing them a recording contract and photographers and a film crew were setting up to shoot a professional quality music video to coincide with the album release .
the video was shot in the monastery itself .
that was one of the stipulations imposed by the cistercian monks .
they refused to be flown to london to record the album in a studio .
funeral chants set the mood the monastery choirmaster , father simeon , selected 17 monks with the finest voices for the actual recording session .
recording execs were a bit taken aback when father simeon informed them he had selected a number of funerary chants owing to the recent deaths of one or two monks .
he insisted it would be inappropriate for the brothers to be expected to do upbeat , joyful chants under the circumstances .
in addition , the monastery ruled out any publicity tour or tv appearances .
the funeral dirges turned out to be a stroke of genius since the soothing , gentle tones proved a chart-busting hit in germany .
it is pure " chill-out " music to untrained ears .
father karl said he is not bothered by the way the chants are received by lay listeners .
chanting -lrb- and internet -rrb- part of everyday life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet and mobile phones are also part of the monks ' daily lives " it 's our way of praying and meditating , " he explained .
" we get up early and begin chanting at 5:15 in the morning .
we intersperse chanting with working all day .
that 's what we do .
" how the music comes across to other people is in the hands of god , " he added .
it is the biggest media exposure the monastery has had in its 875-year history , and father karl concedes that it is all a bit too much for some of the older brothers to cope with .
" i 've been told to refrain from posting the chart standings on the bulletin board next to the dining hall , " he said .
but the royalties for the monastery 's earthly work are welcome .
" it is a veritable gift from god , " he said of the sudden influx of cash .
" we desperately need this money for our work in training monks from vietnam , sri lanka and africa . "
actually , the monks are not as out of touch as outsiders might think .
most of them have their own laptops and mobile phones , which they use to text each other so as to keep in touch when in far-flung parts of the monastery .
e-mail and internet access and youtube are important parts of their lives .
" after all , " said father karl , " st. benedict wisely said in the sixth century that every monk must have stylus and parchment .
we have cyber-stylus and cyber-parchment .
but the idea is the same . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 21.06.2008 chart-busting chants turn modest monks into stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks say chanting is part of their everyday lives move over madonna , because a group of modest monastery monks from austria have rocketed into the top 10 in germany 's charts with an album of gregorian chants . the album " chant - music for paradise " by the cistercian monks of stift heiligenkreuz was released earlier this month and has already reaped gold for universal music - to the utter amazement of the monks themselves .
many of them had never even heard of universal until the label turned them into gold-winning recording stars overnight .
" the whole thing with the recording happened like a miracle , " said father karl , who almost inadvertently turned his monastery , nestled in the vienna woods , into one of the hottest venues on youtube .
he and his fellow monks had posted a youtube video of their chants for the benefit of shut-ins and invalids who could not attend mass .
he had no idea that it would become an internet hit .
" i can not believe this whole story , " he told interviewers .
" i got this e-mail , and there were only two words , ' schnell , schnell -lrb- quick , quick -rrb- , ' and there was a link .
i clicked on the link and found that they were looking for the most beautiful sacred voices . "
last-minute application struck gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks stipulated that their album be recorded in the monastery " they " turned out to be universal music looking for new talent .
" i just answered it and sent them a link to our homepage where we have an example of gregorian chants , " explained father karl .
" it was also the last day for applications . "
he admitted that he thought nothing would come of it .
" after all , our homepage is rather pathetic , " he said .
even so , the online video of the chanting monks had already gotten 80,000 hits at that point .
since the release of the album , the video has registered twice that many hits .
next thing they knew , studio executives were handing them a recording contract and photographers and a film crew were setting up to shoot a professional quality music video to coincide with the album release .
the video was shot in the monastery itself .
that was one of the stipulations imposed by the cistercian monks .
they refused to be flown to london to record the album in a studio .
funeral chants set the mood the monastery choirmaster , father simeon , selected 17 monks with the finest voices for the actual recording session .
recording execs were a bit taken aback when father simeon informed them he had selected a number of funerary chants owing to the recent deaths of one or two monks .
he insisted it would be inappropriate for the brothers to be expected to do upbeat , joyful chants under the circumstances .
in addition , the monastery ruled out any publicity tour or tv appearances .
the funeral dirges turned out to be a stroke of genius since the soothing , gentle tones proved a chart-busting hit in germany .
it is pure " chill-out " music to untrained ears .
father karl said he is not bothered by the way the chants are received by lay listeners .
chanting -lrb- and internet -rrb- part of everyday life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet and mobile phones are also part of the monks ' daily lives " it 's our way of praying and meditating , " he explained .
" we get up early and begin chanting at 5:15 in the morning .
we intersperse chanting with working all day .
that 's what we do .
" how the music comes across to other people is in the hands of god , " he added .
it is the biggest media exposure the monastery has had in its 875-year history , and father karl concedes that it is all a bit too much for some of the older brothers to cope with .
" i 've been told to refrain from posting the chart standings on the bulletin board next to the dining hall , " he said .
but the royalties for the monastery 's earthly work are welcome .
" it is a veritable gift from god , " he said of the sudden influx of cash .
" we desperately need this money for our work in training monks from vietnam , sri lanka and africa . "
actually , the monks are not as out of touch as outsiders might think .
most of them have their own laptops and mobile phones , which they use to text each other so as to keep in touch when in far-flung parts of the monastery .
e-mail and internet access and youtube are important parts of their lives .
" after all , " said father karl , " st. benedict wisely said in the sixth century that every monk must have stylus and parchment .
we have cyber-stylus and cyber-parchment .
but the idea is the same . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .

" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .

croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .
our people can celebrate with us .
if our people are proud of us then we are proud of our people . " croatia coach slaven bilic put a brave face on defeat , saying turkey 's last-gasp equalizer was " a dream goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senturk got in the last kick of the game " it is unbelievable .
that is why football is the best sport in the world , " he said before adding : " the last two minutes were unbelievable .
this will probably haunt me for the rest of my life . "
late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .
" now anything can happen .
if we carry on like this and believe in ourselves then a lot can happen . " the late drama made up for an unattractive first 90 minutes in which croatia enjoyed the best of the opportunities . after the high-class first quarter-final between germany and portugal the previous evening in basel , the 51,428 capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion had to endure a dull and disjointed game .
turkish omissions terim could perhaps excuse his side 's lack of cohesion after injuries and suspension forced him to reshuffle .
there was a new look to the defense , with emre asik and gokhan zan in the center , while veteran keeper rustu was recalled in place of suspended volkan demirel , who will also miss the semi-final unless his appeal against a two-match ban is upheld on monday . turkey will also be without arda turan , tuncay sanli and emre asik , who received their second booking of the tournament , while nihat kahveci , who was substituted with an injury , must be doubtful . terim said he had not yet thought about the players missing for the next game .
" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia thought they had a sure thing for a while turkey rarely got forward after the break but remained stubborn in defense and croatia , who had looked so inventive in defeating germany 2-1 , found it hard to create any danger . olic and ivan rakitic had opportunities and a free-kick outside the box from darijo srna six minutes from time was well saved by rustu . the 35-year-old keeper , turkey 's most-capped player in his 117th game , had experienced some uncertain moments but then thwarted modric from close range in the final minute to take the game into extra-time .
croatia thought they were through croatian fans in the stadium , who had been lighting flares in the stands , raised the noise levels in the extra period after turkey began to look more enterprising , and semih fired over the bar before sanli narrowly shot wide of the post . but when rustu left his goal but failed to get the ball near the byline ahead of modric , substitute klasnic took full advantage to head modric 's cross into the empty net . but there was still time for rustu to make amends for the error as it was his long ball downfield which eventually broke to semih to blast the ball into the top corner of the net . until that moment , croatia were already eyeing up a return match with germany in the semi-final in basel next wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic missed his chance but perhaps shocked by semih 's equalizer , modric and rakitic both missed the goal completely from the spot while srna converted his and substitute mladen petric saw rustu save his effort . turan , semih and altintop all converted their penalties for turkey to secure a remarkable victory . " this is football , you should never give up until the end , until the referee blows the final whistle , " said terim .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 21.06.2008 chart-busting chants turn modest monks into stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks say chanting is part of their everyday lives move over madonna , because a group of modest monastery monks from austria have rocketed into the top 10 in germany 's charts with an album of gregorian chants . the album " chant - music for paradise " by the cistercian monks of stift heiligenkreuz was released earlier this month and has already reaped gold for universal music - to the utter amazement of the monks themselves .
many of them had never even heard of universal until the label turned them into gold-winning recording stars overnight .
" the whole thing with the recording happened like a miracle , " said father karl , who almost inadvertently turned his monastery , nestled in the vienna woods , into one of the hottest venues on youtube .
he and his fellow monks had posted a youtube video of their chants for the benefit of shut-ins and invalids who could not attend mass .
he had no idea that it would become an internet hit .
" i can not believe this whole story , " he told interviewers .
" i got this e-mail , and there were only two words , ' schnell , schnell -lrb- quick , quick -rrb- , ' and there was a link .
i clicked on the link and found that they were looking for the most beautiful sacred voices . "
last-minute application struck gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks stipulated that their album be recorded in the monastery " they " turned out to be universal music looking for new talent .
" i just answered it and sent them a link to our homepage where we have an example of gregorian chants , " explained father karl .
" it was also the last day for applications . "
he admitted that he thought nothing would come of it .
" after all , our homepage is rather pathetic , " he said .
even so , the online video of the chanting monks had already gotten 80,000 hits at that point .
since the release of the album , the video has registered twice that many hits .
next thing they knew , studio executives were handing them a recording contract and photographers and a film crew were setting up to shoot a professional quality music video to coincide with the album release .
the video was shot in the monastery itself .
that was one of the stipulations imposed by the cistercian monks .
they refused to be flown to london to record the album in a studio .
funeral chants set the mood the monastery choirmaster , father simeon , selected 17 monks with the finest voices for the actual recording session .
recording execs were a bit taken aback when father simeon informed them he had selected a number of funerary chants owing to the recent deaths of one or two monks .
he insisted it would be inappropriate for the brothers to be expected to do upbeat , joyful chants under the circumstances .
in addition , the monastery ruled out any publicity tour or tv appearances .
the funeral dirges turned out to be a stroke of genius since the soothing , gentle tones proved a chart-busting hit in germany .
it is pure " chill-out " music to untrained ears .
father karl said he is not bothered by the way the chants are received by lay listeners .
chanting -lrb- and internet -rrb- part of everyday life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet and mobile phones are also part of the monks ' daily lives " it 's our way of praying and meditating , " he explained .
" we get up early and begin chanting at 5:15 in the morning .
we intersperse chanting with working all day .
that 's what we do .
" how the music comes across to other people is in the hands of god , " he added .
it is the biggest media exposure the monastery has had in its 875-year history , and father karl concedes that it is all a bit too much for some of the older brothers to cope with .
" i 've been told to refrain from posting the chart standings on the bulletin board next to the dining hall , " he said .
but the royalties for the monastery 's earthly work are welcome .
" it is a veritable gift from god , " he said of the sudden influx of cash .
" we desperately need this money for our work in training monks from vietnam , sri lanka and africa . "
actually , the monks are not as out of touch as outsiders might think .
most of them have their own laptops and mobile phones , which they use to text each other so as to keep in touch when in far-flung parts of the monastery .
e-mail and internet access and youtube are important parts of their lives .
" after all , " said father karl , " st. benedict wisely said in the sixth century that every monk must have stylus and parchment .
we have cyber-stylus and cyber-parchment .
but the idea is the same . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .
our people can celebrate with us .
if our people are proud of us then we are proud of our people . " croatia coach slaven bilic put a brave face on defeat , saying turkey 's last-gasp equalizer was " a dream goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senturk got in the last kick of the game " it is unbelievable .
that is why football is the best sport in the world , " he said before adding : " the last two minutes were unbelievable .
this will probably haunt me for the rest of my life . "
late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .
" now anything can happen .
if we carry on like this and believe in ourselves then a lot can happen . " the late drama made up for an unattractive first 90 minutes in which croatia enjoyed the best of the opportunities . after the high-class first quarter-final between germany and portugal the previous evening in basel , the 51,428 capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion had to endure a dull and disjointed game .
turkish omissions terim could perhaps excuse his side 's lack of cohesion after injuries and suspension forced him to reshuffle .
there was a new look to the defense , with emre asik and gokhan zan in the center , while veteran keeper rustu was recalled in place of suspended volkan demirel , who will also miss the semi-final unless his appeal against a two-match ban is upheld on monday . turkey will also be without arda turan , tuncay sanli and emre asik , who received their second booking of the tournament , while nihat kahveci , who was substituted with an injury , must be doubtful . terim said he had not yet thought about the players missing for the next game .
" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia thought they had a sure thing for a while turkey rarely got forward after the break but remained stubborn in defense and croatia , who had looked so inventive in defeating germany 2-1 , found it hard to create any danger . olic and ivan rakitic had opportunities and a free-kick outside the box from darijo srna six minutes from time was well saved by rustu . the 35-year-old keeper , turkey 's most-capped player in his 117th game , had experienced some uncertain moments but then thwarted modric from close range in the final minute to take the game into extra-time .
croatia thought they were through croatian fans in the stadium , who had been lighting flares in the stands , raised the noise levels in the extra period after turkey began to look more enterprising , and semih fired over the bar before sanli narrowly shot wide of the post . but when rustu left his goal but failed to get the ball near the byline ahead of modric , substitute klasnic took full advantage to head modric 's cross into the empty net . but there was still time for rustu to make amends for the error as it was his long ball downfield which eventually broke to semih to blast the ball into the top corner of the net . until that moment , croatia were already eyeing up a return match with germany in the semi-final in basel next wednesday .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic missed his chance but perhaps shocked by semih 's equalizer , modric and rakitic both missed the goal completely from the spot while srna converted his and substitute mladen petric saw rustu save his effort . turan , semih and altintop all converted their penalties for turkey to secure a remarkable victory .

croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .
our people can celebrate with us .
if our people are proud of us then we are proud of our people . " croatia coach slaven bilic put a brave face on defeat , saying turkey 's last-gasp equalizer was " a dream goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senturk got in the last kick of the game " it is unbelievable .
that is why football is the best sport in the world , " he said before adding : " the last two minutes were unbelievable .
this will probably haunt me for the rest of my life . "
late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .
" now anything can happen .
if we carry on like this and believe in ourselves then a lot can happen . " the late drama made up for an unattractive first 90 minutes in which croatia enjoyed the best of the opportunities . after the high-class first quarter-final between germany and portugal the previous evening in basel , the 51,428 capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion had to endure a dull and disjointed game .
turkish omissions terim could perhaps excuse his side 's lack of cohesion after injuries and suspension forced him to reshuffle .
there was a new look to the defense , with emre asik and gokhan zan in the center , while veteran keeper rustu was recalled in place of suspended volkan demirel , who will also miss the semi-final unless his appeal against a two-match ban is upheld on monday . turkey will also be without arda turan , tuncay sanli and emre asik , who received their second booking of the tournament , while nihat kahveci , who was substituted with an injury , must be doubtful . terim said he had not yet thought about the players missing for the next game .
" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : match reports spain overwhelm russia to set up final date with germany spain beat italy on penalties to book semi-final spot germany beat turkey 3-2 in dramatic fashion to reach final hiddink leads russia to stunning win over dutch euro 2008 -pipe- 21.06.2008 turkey progress to semi-finals after stunning win over croatia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeper rustu was the star turkey defeated croatia in a penalty shoot-out following a remarkable last few minutes of extra-time in vienna friday to reach the semi-finals of the european championships and a meeting with record champions germany . the victory came after a dramatic climax to the extra-time period , which was preceded by a less entertaining , goalless 90 minutes .
croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .
our people can celebrate with us .
if our people are proud of us then we are proud of our people . " croatia coach slaven bilic put a brave face on defeat , saying turkey 's last-gasp equalizer was " a dream goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senturk got in the last kick of the game " it is unbelievable .
that is why football is the best sport in the world , " he said before adding : " the last two minutes were unbelievable .
this will probably haunt me for the rest of my life . "
late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .
" now anything can happen .
if we carry on like this and believe in ourselves then a lot can happen . " the late drama made up for an unattractive first 90 minutes in which croatia enjoyed the best of the opportunities . after the high-class first quarter-final between germany and portugal the previous evening in basel , the 51,428 capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion had to endure a dull and disjointed game .
turkish omissions terim could perhaps excuse his side 's lack of cohesion after injuries and suspension forced him to reshuffle .
there was a new look to the defense , with emre asik and gokhan zan in the center , while veteran keeper rustu was recalled in place of suspended volkan demirel , who will also miss the semi-final unless his appeal against a two-match ban is upheld on monday . turkey will also be without arda turan , tuncay sanli and emre asik , who received their second booking of the tournament , while nihat kahveci , who was substituted with an injury , must be doubtful . terim said he had not yet thought about the players missing for the next game .
" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia thought they had a sure thing for a while turkey rarely got forward after the break but remained stubborn in defense and croatia , who had looked so inventive in defeating germany 2-1 , found it hard to create any danger . olic and ivan rakitic had opportunities and a free-kick outside the box from darijo srna six minutes from time was well saved by rustu . the 35-year-old keeper , turkey 's most-capped player in his 117th game , had experienced some uncertain moments but then thwarted modric from close range in the final minute to take the game into extra-time .
croatia thought they were through croatian fans in the stadium , who had been lighting flares in the stands , raised the noise levels in the extra period after turkey began to look more enterprising , and semih fired over the bar before sanli narrowly shot wide of the post . but when rustu left his goal but failed to get the ball near the byline ahead of modric , substitute klasnic took full advantage to head modric 's cross into the empty net . but there was still time for rustu to make amends for the error as it was his long ball downfield which eventually broke to semih to blast the ball into the top corner of the net . until that moment , croatia were already eyeing up a return match with germany in the semi-final in basel next wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic missed his chance but perhaps shocked by semih 's equalizer , modric and rakitic both missed the goal completely from the spot while srna converted his and substitute mladen petric saw rustu save his effort . turan , semih and altintop all converted their penalties for turkey to secure a remarkable victory . " this is football , you should never give up until the end , until the referee blows the final whistle , " said terim .

there was a new look to the defense , with emre asik and gokhan zan in the center , while veteran keeper rustu was recalled in place of suspended volkan demirel , who will also miss the semi-final unless his appeal against a two-match ban is upheld on monday . turkey will also be without arda turan , tuncay sanli and emre asik , who received their second booking of the tournament , while nihat kahveci , who was substituted with an injury , must be doubtful . terim said he had not yet thought about the players missing for the next game .
" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia thought they had a sure thing for a while turkey rarely got forward after the break but remained stubborn in defense and croatia , who had looked so inventive in defeating germany 2-1 , found it hard to create any danger . olic and ivan rakitic had opportunities and a free-kick outside the box from darijo srna six minutes from time was well saved by rustu . the 35-year-old keeper , turkey 's most-capped player in his 117th game , had experienced some uncertain moments but then thwarted modric from close range in the final minute to take the game into extra-time .
croatia thought they were through croatian fans in the stadium , who had been lighting flares in the stands , raised the noise levels in the extra period after turkey began to look more enterprising , and semih fired over the bar before sanli narrowly shot wide of the post . but when rustu left his goal but failed to get the ball near the byline ahead of modric , substitute klasnic took full advantage to head modric 's cross into the empty net . but there was still time for rustu to make amends for the error as it was his long ball downfield which eventually broke to semih to blast the ball into the top corner of the net . until that moment , croatia were already eyeing up a return match with germany in the semi-final in basel next wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic missed his chance but perhaps shocked by semih 's equalizer , modric and rakitic both missed the goal completely from the spot while srna converted his and substitute mladen petric saw rustu save his effort . turan , semih and altintop all converted their penalties for turkey to secure a remarkable victory . " this is football , you should never give up until the end , until the referee blows the final whistle , " said terim .
" that is why it is such an interesting game . " dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of them had never even heard of universal until the label turned them into gold-winning recording stars overnight .
" the whole thing with the recording happened like a miracle , " said father karl , who almost inadvertently turned his monastery , nestled in the vienna woods , into one of the hottest venues on youtube .
he and his fellow monks had posted a youtube video of their chants for the benefit of shut-ins and invalids who could not attend mass .
he had no idea that it would become an internet hit .
" i can not believe this whole story , " he told interviewers .
" i got this e-mail , and there were only two words , ' schnell , schnell -lrb- quick , quick -rrb- , ' and there was a link .
i clicked on the link and found that they were looking for the most beautiful sacred voices . "
last-minute application struck gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks stipulated that their album be recorded in the monastery " they " turned out to be universal music looking for new talent .
" i just answered it and sent them a link to our homepage where we have an example of gregorian chants , " explained father karl .
" it was also the last day for applications . "
he admitted that he thought nothing would come of it .
" after all , our homepage is rather pathetic , " he said .
even so , the online video of the chanting monks had already gotten 80,000 hits at that point .
since the release of the album , the video has registered twice that many hits .
next thing they knew , studio executives were handing them a recording contract and photographers and a film crew were setting up to shoot a professional quality music video to coincide with the album release .
the video was shot in the monastery itself .
that was one of the stipulations imposed by the cistercian monks .
they refused to be flown to london to record the album in a studio .
funeral chants set the mood the monastery choirmaster , father simeon , selected 17 monks with the finest voices for the actual recording session .
recording execs were a bit taken aback when father simeon informed them he had selected a number of funerary chants owing to the recent deaths of one or two monks .
he insisted it would be inappropriate for the brothers to be expected to do upbeat , joyful chants under the circumstances .
in addition , the monastery ruled out any publicity tour or tv appearances .
the funeral dirges turned out to be a stroke of genius since the soothing , gentle tones proved a chart-busting hit in germany .
it is pure " chill-out " music to untrained ears .
father karl said he is not bothered by the way the chants are received by lay listeners .
chanting -lrb- and internet -rrb- part of everyday life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet and mobile phones are also part of the monks ' daily lives " it 's our way of praying and meditating , " he explained .
" we get up early and begin chanting at 5:15 in the morning .
we intersperse chanting with working all day .
that 's what we do .
" how the music comes across to other people is in the hands of god , " he added .
it is the biggest media exposure the monastery has had in its 875-year history , and father karl concedes that it is all a bit too much for some of the older brothers to cope with .
" i 've been told to refrain from posting the chart standings on the bulletin board next to the dining hall , " he said .
but the royalties for the monastery 's earthly work are welcome .
" it is a veritable gift from god , " he said of the sudden influx of cash .
" we desperately need this money for our work in training monks from vietnam , sri lanka and africa . "
actually , the monks are not as out of touch as outsiders might think .
most of them have their own laptops and mobile phones , which they use to text each other so as to keep in touch when in far-flung parts of the monastery .
e-mail and internet access and youtube are important parts of their lives .
" after all , " said father karl , " st. benedict wisely said in the sixth century that every monk must have stylus and parchment .
we have cyber-stylus and cyber-parchment .
but the idea is the same . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .
our people can celebrate with us .
if our people are proud of us then we are proud of our people . " croatia coach slaven bilic put a brave face on defeat , saying turkey 's last-gasp equalizer was " a dream goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senturk got in the last kick of the game " it is unbelievable .
that is why football is the best sport in the world , " he said before adding : " the last two minutes were unbelievable .
this will probably haunt me for the rest of my life . "
late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .
" now anything can happen .
if we carry on like this and believe in ourselves then a lot can happen . " the late drama made up for an unattractive first 90 minutes in which croatia enjoyed the best of the opportunities . after the high-class first quarter-final between germany and portugal the previous evening in basel , the 51,428 capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion had to endure a dull and disjointed game .
turkish omissions terim could perhaps excuse his side 's lack of cohesion after injuries and suspension forced him to reshuffle .
there was a new look to the defense , with emre asik and gokhan zan in the center , while veteran keeper rustu was recalled in place of suspended volkan demirel , who will also miss the semi-final unless his appeal against a two-match ban is upheld on monday . turkey will also be without arda turan , tuncay sanli and emre asik , who received their second booking of the tournament , while nihat kahveci , who was substituted with an injury , must be doubtful . terim said he had not yet thought about the players missing for the next game .
" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia thought they had a sure thing for a while turkey rarely got forward after the break but remained stubborn in defense and croatia , who had looked so inventive in defeating germany 2-1 , found it hard to create any danger . olic and ivan rakitic had opportunities and a free-kick outside the box from darijo srna six minutes from time was well saved by rustu . the 35-year-old keeper , turkey 's most-capped player in his 117th game , had experienced some uncertain moments but then thwarted modric from close range in the final minute to take the game into extra-time .
croatia thought they were through croatian fans in the stadium , who had been lighting flares in the stands , raised the noise levels in the extra period after turkey began to look more enterprising , and semih fired over the bar before sanli narrowly shot wide of the post . but when rustu left his goal but failed to get the ball near the byline ahead of modric , substitute klasnic took full advantage to head modric 's cross into the empty net . but there was still time for rustu to make amends for the error as it was his long ball downfield which eventually broke to semih to blast the ball into the top corner of the net . until that moment , croatia were already eyeing up a return match with germany in the semi-final in basel next wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic missed his chance but perhaps shocked by semih 's equalizer , modric and rakitic both missed the goal completely from the spot while srna converted his and substitute mladen petric saw rustu save his effort . turan , semih and altintop all converted their penalties for turkey to secure a remarkable victory . " this is football , you should never give up until the end , until the referee blows the final whistle , " said terim .
" that is why it is such an interesting game . " dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

belgium , germany , holland and italy each have nuclear weapons at one of their national air bases . the weapons at each of the national bases are under control of the us air force in peacetime but would , upon receipt of proper authority from the us national command authority , be handed over to the national air force at the base in a war for delivery by the host nation 's own aircraft , the federation wrote .
missing nukes the blue ribbon review -lrb- brr -rrb- was carried out after the us air force lost track of six nuclear warheads for more than a day last year as they were flown across the us . the federation of american scientists is pushing for release of details of the report . the brr found that " host nation security at overseas nuclear-capable units varies from country to country in terms of personnel , facilities , and equipment , " the federation quoted the report as saying . there were security lapses in " support buildings , fencing , lighting , and security systems , " the report found . one example cited was having conscripts with as little as nine months active duty protect nuclear weapons against theft . the number and location of nuclear weapons in europe are secret , but the federation estimated the number at 200 to 350 b61 nuclear bombs . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are plenty of women in these happy crowds , which refutes once and for all the sexist reputation of our game , " said uefa boss michel platini earlier in the tournament . uefa spokesman wolfgang eichler also spoke of " a tendency towards a growing number of women in the fan zones and stadiums " with a german football spokesman speaking in more general terms of " growing interest of women in football - including the bundesliga . " a combination of reasons the end of hooliganism in stadiums , greater comfort there , as well as football turning from a simple sports competition to an event are listed as some factors which attract women to the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian fans at the 2006 world cup the trend was first observed at the 2006 world cup - which like euro saw a figure of almost 50 percent women in the stadiums - and it now even covers the merchandising sector . " at least half of our shoppers are women , " said one member of the official euro fan shop in vienna .
" while men simply buy the xl shirt of their favorite team women want some advice as far as size and color are concerned . " this shows a different approach of the genders , which is also confirmed by nicole selmer , author of the book " watching the boys play . " " male and female football fans have a lot in common , but there are also differences .
women make more personal remarks about players such as ' he looks good ' or ' he can even put three sentences together , " ' said selmer . not just the babe factor she insisted this does n't mean that women do n't have a clue about football and were only interested in the looks of players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sex appeal of players like cristiano ronaldo does n't keep the women away , but it 's not the only reason they 're fans in germany , a poll by the allensbach institute conducted ahead of euro seems to confirms this as well , with 59 percent of the women saying they are really into the game when germany plays - as opposed to 57 percent of the men . another poll , from the german elitepartner online dating service , also reveals that 34 per cent of the men polled consider football-crazy women sexy .

women make more personal remarks about players such as ' he looks good ' or ' he can even put three sentences together , " ' said selmer . not just the babe factor she insisted this does n't mean that women do n't have a clue about football and were only interested in the looks of players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sex appeal of players like cristiano ronaldo does n't keep the women away , but it 's not the only reason they 're fans in germany , a poll by the allensbach institute conducted ahead of euro seems to confirms this as well , with 59 percent of the women saying they are really into the game when germany plays - as opposed to 57 percent of the men . another poll , from the german elitepartner online dating service , also reveals that 34 per cent of the men polled consider football-crazy women sexy .

croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .
our people can celebrate with us .
if our people are proud of us then we are proud of our people . " croatia coach slaven bilic put a brave face on defeat , saying turkey 's last-gasp equalizer was " a dream goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senturk got in the last kick of the game " it is unbelievable .
that is why football is the best sport in the world , " he said before adding : " the last two minutes were unbelievable .
this will probably haunt me for the rest of my life . "
late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .
" now anything can happen .
if we carry on like this and believe in ourselves then a lot can happen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 21.06.2008 chart-busting chants turn modest monks into stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks say chanting is part of their everyday lives move over madonna , because a group of modest monastery monks from austria have rocketed into the top 10 in germany 's charts with an album of gregorian chants . the album " chant - music for paradise " by the cistercian monks of stift heiligenkreuz was released earlier this month and has already reaped gold for universal music - to the utter amazement of the monks themselves .
many of them had never even heard of universal until the label turned them into gold-winning recording stars overnight .
" the whole thing with the recording happened like a miracle , " said father karl , who almost inadvertently turned his monastery , nestled in the vienna woods , into one of the hottest venues on youtube .
he and his fellow monks had posted a youtube video of their chants for the benefit of shut-ins and invalids who could not attend mass .
he had no idea that it would become an internet hit .
" i can not believe this whole story , " he told interviewers .
" i got this e-mail , and there were only two words , ' schnell , schnell -lrb- quick , quick -rrb- , ' and there was a link .
i clicked on the link and found that they were looking for the most beautiful sacred voices . "
last-minute application struck gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks stipulated that their album be recorded in the monastery " they " turned out to be universal music looking for new talent .
" i just answered it and sent them a link to our homepage where we have an example of gregorian chants , " explained father karl .
" it was also the last day for applications . "
he admitted that he thought nothing would come of it .
" after all , our homepage is rather pathetic , " he said .
even so , the online video of the chanting monks had already gotten 80,000 hits at that point .
since the release of the album , the video has registered twice that many hits .
next thing they knew , studio executives were handing them a recording contract and photographers and a film crew were setting up to shoot a professional quality music video to coincide with the album release .
the video was shot in the monastery itself .
that was one of the stipulations imposed by the cistercian monks .
they refused to be flown to london to record the album in a studio .
funeral chants set the mood the monastery choirmaster , father simeon , selected 17 monks with the finest voices for the actual recording session .
recording execs were a bit taken aback when father simeon informed them he had selected a number of funerary chants owing to the recent deaths of one or two monks .
he insisted it would be inappropriate for the brothers to be expected to do upbeat , joyful chants under the circumstances .
in addition , the monastery ruled out any publicity tour or tv appearances .
the funeral dirges turned out to be a stroke of genius since the soothing , gentle tones proved a chart-busting hit in germany .
it is pure " chill-out " music to untrained ears .
father karl said he is not bothered by the way the chants are received by lay listeners .
chanting -lrb- and internet -rrb- part of everyday life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet and mobile phones are also part of the monks ' daily lives " it 's our way of praying and meditating , " he explained .
" we get up early and begin chanting at 5:15 in the morning .
we intersperse chanting with working all day .
that 's what we do .
" how the music comes across to other people is in the hands of god , " he added .
it is the biggest media exposure the monastery has had in its 875-year history , and father karl concedes that it is all a bit too much for some of the older brothers to cope with .
" i 've been told to refrain from posting the chart standings on the bulletin board next to the dining hall , " he said .
but the royalties for the monastery 's earthly work are welcome .
" it is a veritable gift from god , " he said of the sudden influx of cash .
" we desperately need this money for our work in training monks from vietnam , sri lanka and africa . "
actually , the monks are not as out of touch as outsiders might think .
most of them have their own laptops and mobile phones , which they use to text each other so as to keep in touch when in far-flung parts of the monastery .
e-mail and internet access and youtube are important parts of their lives .
" after all , " said father karl , " st. benedict wisely said in the sixth century that every monk must have stylus and parchment .
we have cyber-stylus and cyber-parchment .
but the idea is the same . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

belgium , germany , holland and italy each have nuclear weapons at one of their national air bases . the weapons at each of the national bases are under control of the us air force in peacetime but would , upon receipt of proper authority from the us national command authority , be handed over to the national air force at the base in a war for delivery by the host nation 's own aircraft , the federation wrote .
missing nukes the blue ribbon review -lrb- brr -rrb- was carried out after the us air force lost track of six nuclear warheads for more than a day last year as they were flown across the us . the federation of american scientists is pushing for release of details of the report . the brr found that " host nation security at overseas nuclear-capable units varies from country to country in terms of personnel , facilities , and equipment , " the federation quoted the report as saying . there were security lapses in " support buildings , fencing , lighting , and security systems , " the report found . one example cited was having conscripts with as little as nine months active duty protect nuclear weapons against theft . the number and location of nuclear weapons in europe are secret , but the federation estimated the number at 200 to 350 b61 nuclear bombs . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a combination of reasons the end of hooliganism in stadiums , greater comfort there , as well as football turning from a simple sports competition to an event are listed as some factors which attract women to the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian fans at the 2006 world cup the trend was first observed at the 2006 world cup - which like euro saw a figure of almost 50 percent women in the stadiums - and it now even covers the merchandising sector . " at least half of our shoppers are women , " said one member of the official euro fan shop in vienna .
" while men simply buy the xl shirt of their favorite team women want some advice as far as size and color are concerned . " this shows a different approach of the genders , which is also confirmed by nicole selmer , author of the book " watching the boys play . " " male and female football fans have a lot in common , but there are also differences .
women make more personal remarks about players such as ' he looks good ' or ' he can even put three sentences together , " ' said selmer . not just the babe factor she insisted this does n't mean that women do n't have a clue about football and were only interested in the looks of players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sex appeal of players like cristiano ronaldo does n't keep the women away , but it 's not the only reason they 're fans in germany , a poll by the allensbach institute conducted ahead of euro seems to confirms this as well , with 59 percent of the women saying they are really into the game when germany plays - as opposed to 57 percent of the men . another poll , from the german elitepartner online dating service , also reveals that 34 per cent of the men polled consider football-crazy women sexy .

croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .
our people can celebrate with us .
if our people are proud of us then we are proud of our people . " croatia coach slaven bilic put a brave face on defeat , saying turkey 's last-gasp equalizer was " a dream goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senturk got in the last kick of the game " it is unbelievable .
that is why football is the best sport in the world , " he said before adding : " the last two minutes were unbelievable .
this will probably haunt me for the rest of my life . "
late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .
" now anything can happen .
if we carry on like this and believe in ourselves then a lot can happen . " the late drama made up for an unattractive first 90 minutes in which croatia enjoyed the best of the opportunities . after the high-class first quarter-final between germany and portugal the previous evening in basel , the 51,428 capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion had to endure a dull and disjointed game .
turkish omissions terim could perhaps excuse his side 's lack of cohesion after injuries and suspension forced him to reshuffle .
there was a new look to the defense , with emre asik and gokhan zan in the center , while veteran keeper rustu was recalled in place of suspended volkan demirel , who will also miss the semi-final unless his appeal against a two-match ban is upheld on monday . turkey will also be without arda turan , tuncay sanli and emre asik , who received their second booking of the tournament , while nihat kahveci , who was substituted with an injury , must be doubtful . terim said he had not yet thought about the players missing for the next game .
" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia thought they had a sure thing for a while turkey rarely got forward after the break but remained stubborn in defense and croatia , who had looked so inventive in defeating germany 2-1 , found it hard to create any danger . olic and ivan rakitic had opportunities and a free-kick outside the box from darijo srna six minutes from time was well saved by rustu . the 35-year-old keeper , turkey 's most-capped player in his 117th game , had experienced some uncertain moments but then thwarted modric from close range in the final minute to take the game into extra-time .
croatia thought they were through croatian fans in the stadium , who had been lighting flares in the stands , raised the noise levels in the extra period after turkey began to look more enterprising , and semih fired over the bar before sanli narrowly shot wide of the post . but when rustu left his goal but failed to get the ball near the byline ahead of modric , substitute klasnic took full advantage to head modric 's cross into the empty net . but there was still time for rustu to make amends for the error as it was his long ball downfield which eventually broke to semih to blast the ball into the top corner of the net . until that moment , croatia were already eyeing up a return match with germany in the semi-final in basel next wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic missed his chance but perhaps shocked by semih 's equalizer , modric and rakitic both missed the goal completely from the spot while srna converted his and substitute mladen petric saw rustu save his effort . turan , semih and altintop all converted their penalties for turkey to secure a remarkable victory . " this is football , you should never give up until the end , until the referee blows the final whistle , " said terim .
" that is why it is such an interesting game . " dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of them had never even heard of universal until the label turned them into gold-winning recording stars overnight .
" the whole thing with the recording happened like a miracle , " said father karl , who almost inadvertently turned his monastery , nestled in the vienna woods , into one of the hottest venues on youtube .
he and his fellow monks had posted a youtube video of their chants for the benefit of shut-ins and invalids who could not attend mass .
he had no idea that it would become an internet hit .
" i can not believe this whole story , " he told interviewers .
" i got this e-mail , and there were only two words , ' schnell , schnell -lrb- quick , quick -rrb- , ' and there was a link .
i clicked on the link and found that they were looking for the most beautiful sacred voices . "

" it was also the last day for applications . "
he admitted that he thought nothing would come of it .
" after all , our homepage is rather pathetic , " he said .
even so , the online video of the chanting monks had already gotten 80,000 hits at that point .
since the release of the album , the video has registered twice that many hits .
next thing they knew , studio executives were handing them a recording contract and photographers and a film crew were setting up to shoot a professional quality music video to coincide with the album release .
the video was shot in the monastery itself .
that was one of the stipulations imposed by the cistercian monks .
they refused to be flown to london to record the album in a studio .
funeral chants set the mood the monastery choirmaster , father simeon , selected 17 monks with the finest voices for the actual recording session .
recording execs were a bit taken aback when father simeon informed them he had selected a number of funerary chants owing to the recent deaths of one or two monks .
he insisted it would be inappropriate for the brothers to be expected to do upbeat , joyful chants under the circumstances .

many of them had never even heard of universal until the label turned them into gold-winning recording stars overnight .
" the whole thing with the recording happened like a miracle , " said father karl , who almost inadvertently turned his monastery , nestled in the vienna woods , into one of the hottest venues on youtube .
he and his fellow monks had posted a youtube video of their chants for the benefit of shut-ins and invalids who could not attend mass .
he had no idea that it would become an internet hit .
" i can not believe this whole story , " he told interviewers .
" i got this e-mail , and there were only two words , ' schnell , schnell -lrb- quick , quick -rrb- , ' and there was a link .
i clicked on the link and found that they were looking for the most beautiful sacred voices . "
last-minute application struck gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks stipulated that their album be recorded in the monastery " they " turned out to be universal music looking for new talent .
" i just answered it and sent them a link to our homepage where we have an example of gregorian chants , " explained father karl .
" it was also the last day for applications . "
he admitted that he thought nothing would come of it .
" after all , our homepage is rather pathetic , " he said .
even so , the online video of the chanting monks had already gotten 80,000 hits at that point .
since the release of the album , the video has registered twice that many hits .
next thing they knew , studio executives were handing them a recording contract and photographers and a film crew were setting up to shoot a professional quality music video to coincide with the album release .
the video was shot in the monastery itself .
that was one of the stipulations imposed by the cistercian monks .
they refused to be flown to london to record the album in a studio .
funeral chants set the mood the monastery choirmaster , father simeon , selected 17 monks with the finest voices for the actual recording session .
recording execs were a bit taken aback when father simeon informed them he had selected a number of funerary chants owing to the recent deaths of one or two monks .
he insisted it would be inappropriate for the brothers to be expected to do upbeat , joyful chants under the circumstances .
in addition , the monastery ruled out any publicity tour or tv appearances .
the funeral dirges turned out to be a stroke of genius since the soothing , gentle tones proved a chart-busting hit in germany .
it is pure " chill-out " music to untrained ears .
father karl said he is not bothered by the way the chants are received by lay listeners .
chanting -lrb- and internet -rrb- part of everyday life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet and mobile phones are also part of the monks ' daily lives " it 's our way of praying and meditating , " he explained .
" we get up early and begin chanting at 5:15 in the morning .
we intersperse chanting with working all day .
that 's what we do .
" how the music comes across to other people is in the hands of god , " he added .
it is the biggest media exposure the monastery has had in its 875-year history , and father karl concedes that it is all a bit too much for some of the older brothers to cope with .
" i 've been told to refrain from posting the chart standings on the bulletin board next to the dining hall , " he said .
but the royalties for the monastery 's earthly work are welcome .
" it is a veritable gift from god , " he said of the sudden influx of cash .
" we desperately need this money for our work in training monks from vietnam , sri lanka and africa . "
actually , the monks are not as out of touch as outsiders might think .
most of them have their own laptops and mobile phones , which they use to text each other so as to keep in touch when in far-flung parts of the monastery .
e-mail and internet access and youtube are important parts of their lives .
" after all , " said father karl , " st. benedict wisely said in the sixth century that every monk must have stylus and parchment .
we have cyber-stylus and cyber-parchment .
but the idea is the same . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .
our people can celebrate with us .
if our people are proud of us then we are proud of our people . " croatia coach slaven bilic put a brave face on defeat , saying turkey 's last-gasp equalizer was " a dream goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senturk got in the last kick of the game " it is unbelievable .
that is why football is the best sport in the world , " he said before adding : " the last two minutes were unbelievable .
this will probably haunt me for the rest of my life . "
late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .
" now anything can happen .
if we carry on like this and believe in ourselves then a lot can happen . " the late drama made up for an unattractive first 90 minutes in which croatia enjoyed the best of the opportunities . after the high-class first quarter-final between germany and portugal the previous evening in basel , the 51,428 capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion had to endure a dull and disjointed game .
turkish omissions terim could perhaps excuse his side 's lack of cohesion after injuries and suspension forced him to reshuffle .
there was a new look to the defense , with emre asik and gokhan zan in the center , while veteran keeper rustu was recalled in place of suspended volkan demirel , who will also miss the semi-final unless his appeal against a two-match ban is upheld on monday . turkey will also be without arda turan , tuncay sanli and emre asik , who received their second booking of the tournament , while nihat kahveci , who was substituted with an injury , must be doubtful . terim said he had not yet thought about the players missing for the next game .
" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia thought they had a sure thing for a while turkey rarely got forward after the break but remained stubborn in defense and croatia , who had looked so inventive in defeating germany 2-1 , found it hard to create any danger . olic and ivan rakitic had opportunities and a free-kick outside the box from darijo srna six minutes from time was well saved by rustu . the 35-year-old keeper , turkey 's most-capped player in his 117th game , had experienced some uncertain moments but then thwarted modric from close range in the final minute to take the game into extra-time .
croatia thought they were through croatian fans in the stadium , who had been lighting flares in the stands , raised the noise levels in the extra period after turkey began to look more enterprising , and semih fired over the bar before sanli narrowly shot wide of the post . but when rustu left his goal but failed to get the ball near the byline ahead of modric , substitute klasnic took full advantage to head modric 's cross into the empty net . but there was still time for rustu to make amends for the error as it was his long ball downfield which eventually broke to semih to blast the ball into the top corner of the net . until that moment , croatia were already eyeing up a return match with germany in the semi-final in basel next wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic missed his chance but perhaps shocked by semih 's equalizer , modric and rakitic both missed the goal completely from the spot while srna converted his and substitute mladen petric saw rustu save his effort . turan , semih and altintop all converted their penalties for turkey to secure a remarkable victory .

" there are plenty of women in these happy crowds , which refutes once and for all the sexist reputation of our game , " said uefa boss michel platini earlier in the tournament . uefa spokesman wolfgang eichler also spoke of " a tendency towards a growing number of women in the fan zones and stadiums " with a german football spokesman speaking in more general terms of " growing interest of women in football - including the bundesliga . " a combination of reasons the end of hooliganism in stadiums , greater comfort there , as well as football turning from a simple sports competition to an event are listed as some factors which attract women to the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian fans at the 2006 world cup the trend was first observed at the 2006 world cup - which like euro saw a figure of almost 50 percent women in the stadiums - and it now even covers the merchandising sector . " at least half of our shoppers are women , " said one member of the official euro fan shop in vienna .
" while men simply buy the xl shirt of their favorite team women want some advice as far as size and color are concerned . " this shows a different approach of the genders , which is also confirmed by nicole selmer , author of the book " watching the boys play . " " male and female football fans have a lot in common , but there are also differences .
women make more personal remarks about players such as ' he looks good ' or ' he can even put three sentences together , " ' said selmer . not just the babe factor she insisted this does n't mean that women do n't have a clue about football and were only interested in the looks of players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sex appeal of players like cristiano ronaldo does n't keep the women away , but it 's not the only reason they 're fans in germany , a poll by the allensbach institute conducted ahead of euro seems to confirms this as well , with 59 percent of the women saying they are really into the game when germany plays - as opposed to 57 percent of the men . another poll , from the german elitepartner online dating service , also reveals that 34 per cent of the men polled consider football-crazy women sexy . " men like it when women love the sport .
they hope for football evenings with them , " said elitepartner psychologist lisa fischbach . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .
our people can celebrate with us .
if our people are proud of us then we are proud of our people . " croatia coach slaven bilic put a brave face on defeat , saying turkey 's last-gasp equalizer was " a dream goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senturk got in the last kick of the game " it is unbelievable .
that is why football is the best sport in the world , " he said before adding : " the last two minutes were unbelievable .
this will probably haunt me for the rest of my life . "
late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .
" now anything can happen .
if we carry on like this and believe in ourselves then a lot can happen . " the late drama made up for an unattractive first 90 minutes in which croatia enjoyed the best of the opportunities . after the high-class first quarter-final between germany and portugal the previous evening in basel , the 51,428 capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion had to endure a dull and disjointed game .
turkish omissions terim could perhaps excuse his side 's lack of cohesion after injuries and suspension forced him to reshuffle .
there was a new look to the defense , with emre asik and gokhan zan in the center , while veteran keeper rustu was recalled in place of suspended volkan demirel , who will also miss the semi-final unless his appeal against a two-match ban is upheld on monday . turkey will also be without arda turan , tuncay sanli and emre asik , who received their second booking of the tournament , while nihat kahveci , who was substituted with an injury , must be doubtful . terim said he had not yet thought about the players missing for the next game .
" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia thought they had a sure thing for a while turkey rarely got forward after the break but remained stubborn in defense and croatia , who had looked so inventive in defeating germany 2-1 , found it hard to create any danger . olic and ivan rakitic had opportunities and a free-kick outside the box from darijo srna six minutes from time was well saved by rustu . the 35-year-old keeper , turkey 's most-capped player in his 117th game , had experienced some uncertain moments but then thwarted modric from close range in the final minute to take the game into extra-time .
croatia thought they were through croatian fans in the stadium , who had been lighting flares in the stands , raised the noise levels in the extra period after turkey began to look more enterprising , and semih fired over the bar before sanli narrowly shot wide of the post . but when rustu left his goal but failed to get the ball near the byline ahead of modric , substitute klasnic took full advantage to head modric 's cross into the empty net . but there was still time for rustu to make amends for the error as it was his long ball downfield which eventually broke to semih to blast the ball into the top corner of the net . until that moment , croatia were already eyeing up a return match with germany in the semi-final in basel next wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic missed his chance but perhaps shocked by semih 's equalizer , modric and rakitic both missed the goal completely from the spot while srna converted his and substitute mladen petric saw rustu save his effort . turan , semih and altintop all converted their penalties for turkey to secure a remarkable victory . " this is football , you should never give up until the end , until the referee blows the final whistle , " said terim .
" that is why it is such an interesting game . " dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

belgium , germany , holland and italy each have nuclear weapons at one of their national air bases . the weapons at each of the national bases are under control of the us air force in peacetime but would , upon receipt of proper authority from the us national command authority , be handed over to the national air force at the base in a war for delivery by the host nation 's own aircraft , the federation wrote .
missing nukes the blue ribbon review -lrb- brr -rrb- was carried out after the us air force lost track of six nuclear warheads for more than a day last year as they were flown across the us . the federation of american scientists is pushing for release of details of the report . the brr found that " host nation security at overseas nuclear-capable units varies from country to country in terms of personnel , facilities , and equipment , " the federation quoted the report as saying . there were security lapses in " support buildings , fencing , lighting , and security systems , " the report found . one example cited was having conscripts with as little as nine months active duty protect nuclear weapons against theft . the number and location of nuclear weapons in europe are secret , but the federation estimated the number at 200 to 350 b61 nuclear bombs . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are plenty of women in these happy crowds , which refutes once and for all the sexist reputation of our game , " said uefa boss michel platini earlier in the tournament . uefa spokesman wolfgang eichler also spoke of " a tendency towards a growing number of women in the fan zones and stadiums " with a german football spokesman speaking in more general terms of " growing interest of women in football - including the bundesliga . " a combination of reasons the end of hooliganism in stadiums , greater comfort there , as well as football turning from a simple sports competition to an event are listed as some factors which attract women to the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian fans at the 2006 world cup the trend was first observed at the 2006 world cup - which like euro saw a figure of almost 50 percent women in the stadiums - and it now even covers the merchandising sector . " at least half of our shoppers are women , " said one member of the official euro fan shop in vienna .
" while men simply buy the xl shirt of their favorite team women want some advice as far as size and color are concerned . " this shows a different approach of the genders , which is also confirmed by nicole selmer , author of the book " watching the boys play . " " male and female football fans have a lot in common , but there are also differences .
women make more personal remarks about players such as ' he looks good ' or ' he can even put three sentences together , " ' said selmer . not just the babe factor she insisted this does n't mean that women do n't have a clue about football and were only interested in the looks of players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sex appeal of players like cristiano ronaldo does n't keep the women away , but it 's not the only reason they 're fans in germany , a poll by the allensbach institute conducted ahead of euro seems to confirms this as well , with 59 percent of the women saying they are really into the game when germany plays - as opposed to 57 percent of the men . another poll , from the german elitepartner online dating service , also reveals that 34 per cent of the men polled consider football-crazy women sexy .

a defense ministry spokesman said jung would make clear the exact number at the end of next week . jung said in a radio interview saturday that any increase in troop strength would be used for training and civil reconstruction projects . " we want to increase training three-fold .
next year we want to train 7,500 afghan troops .

croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .
our people can celebrate with us .
if our people are proud of us then we are proud of our people . " croatia coach slaven bilic put a brave face on defeat , saying turkey 's last-gasp equalizer was " a dream goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senturk got in the last kick of the game " it is unbelievable .
that is why football is the best sport in the world , " he said before adding : " the last two minutes were unbelievable .
this will probably haunt me for the rest of my life . "
late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .
" now anything can happen .
if we carry on like this and believe in ourselves then a lot can happen . " the late drama made up for an unattractive first 90 minutes in which croatia enjoyed the best of the opportunities . after the high-class first quarter-final between germany and portugal the previous evening in basel , the 51,428 capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion had to endure a dull and disjointed game .
turkish omissions terim could perhaps excuse his side 's lack of cohesion after injuries and suspension forced him to reshuffle .
there was a new look to the defense , with emre asik and gokhan zan in the center , while veteran keeper rustu was recalled in place of suspended volkan demirel , who will also miss the semi-final unless his appeal against a two-match ban is upheld on monday . turkey will also be without arda turan , tuncay sanli and emre asik , who received their second booking of the tournament , while nihat kahveci , who was substituted with an injury , must be doubtful . terim said he had not yet thought about the players missing for the next game .
" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia thought they had a sure thing for a while turkey rarely got forward after the break but remained stubborn in defense and croatia , who had looked so inventive in defeating germany 2-1 , found it hard to create any danger . olic and ivan rakitic had opportunities and a free-kick outside the box from darijo srna six minutes from time was well saved by rustu . the 35-year-old keeper , turkey 's most-capped player in his 117th game , had experienced some uncertain moments but then thwarted modric from close range in the final minute to take the game into extra-time .
croatia thought they were through croatian fans in the stadium , who had been lighting flares in the stands , raised the noise levels in the extra period after turkey began to look more enterprising , and semih fired over the bar before sanli narrowly shot wide of the post . but when rustu left his goal but failed to get the ball near the byline ahead of modric , substitute klasnic took full advantage to head modric 's cross into the empty net . but there was still time for rustu to make amends for the error as it was his long ball downfield which eventually broke to semih to blast the ball into the top corner of the net . until that moment , croatia were already eyeing up a return match with germany in the semi-final in basel next wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic missed his chance but perhaps shocked by semih 's equalizer , modric and rakitic both missed the goal completely from the spot while srna converted his and substitute mladen petric saw rustu save his effort . turan , semih and altintop all converted their penalties for turkey to secure a remarkable victory .

" there are plenty of women in these happy crowds , which refutes once and for all the sexist reputation of our game , " said uefa boss michel platini earlier in the tournament . uefa spokesman wolfgang eichler also spoke of " a tendency towards a growing number of women in the fan zones and stadiums " with a german football spokesman speaking in more general terms of " growing interest of women in football - including the bundesliga . " a combination of reasons the end of hooliganism in stadiums , greater comfort there , as well as football turning from a simple sports competition to an event are listed as some factors which attract women to the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian fans at the 2006 world cup the trend was first observed at the 2006 world cup - which like euro saw a figure of almost 50 percent women in the stadiums - and it now even covers the merchandising sector . " at least half of our shoppers are women , " said one member of the official euro fan shop in vienna .
" while men simply buy the xl shirt of their favorite team women want some advice as far as size and color are concerned . " this shows a different approach of the genders , which is also confirmed by nicole selmer , author of the book " watching the boys play . " " male and female football fans have a lot in common , but there are also differences .
women make more personal remarks about players such as ' he looks good ' or ' he can even put three sentences together , " ' said selmer . not just the babe factor she insisted this does n't mean that women do n't have a clue about football and were only interested in the looks of players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sex appeal of players like cristiano ronaldo does n't keep the women away , but it 's not the only reason they 're fans in germany , a poll by the allensbach institute conducted ahead of euro seems to confirms this as well , with 59 percent of the women saying they are really into the game when germany plays - as opposed to 57 percent of the men . another poll , from the german elitepartner online dating service , also reveals that 34 per cent of the men polled consider football-crazy women sexy .

croatia celebrated what they thought to be a 119th-minute winner from substitute ivan klasnic , only for semih senturk to equalize for turkey with the last kick of the game . turkey kept their cool in the penalty showdown , winning 3-1 after croatia missed three of their four spot kicks - the last saved by veteran goalkeeper rustu recber - and turkey converted all of theirs . an emotional turkey coach fatih terim said : " what has happened to us today is unique in history .
we have become one of the most important football nations .
our people can celebrate with us .
if our people are proud of us then we are proud of our people . " croatia coach slaven bilic put a brave face on defeat , saying turkey 's last-gasp equalizer was " a dream goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senturk got in the last kick of the game " it is unbelievable .
that is why football is the best sport in the world , " he said before adding : " the last two minutes were unbelievable .
this will probably haunt me for the rest of my life . "
late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .
" now anything can happen .
if we carry on like this and believe in ourselves then a lot can happen . " the late drama made up for an unattractive first 90 minutes in which croatia enjoyed the best of the opportunities . after the high-class first quarter-final between germany and portugal the previous evening in basel , the 51,428 capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion had to endure a dull and disjointed game .
turkish omissions terim could perhaps excuse his side 's lack of cohesion after injuries and suspension forced him to reshuffle .
there was a new look to the defense , with emre asik and gokhan zan in the center , while veteran keeper rustu was recalled in place of suspended volkan demirel , who will also miss the semi-final unless his appeal against a two-match ban is upheld on monday . turkey will also be without arda turan , tuncay sanli and emre asik , who received their second booking of the tournament , while nihat kahveci , who was substituted with an injury , must be doubtful . terim said he had not yet thought about the players missing for the next game .
" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senturk got in the last kick of the game " it is unbelievable .
that is why football is the best sport in the world , " he said before adding : " the last two minutes were unbelievable .
this will probably haunt me for the rest of my life . "
late drama it was the third match in a row in which turkey have pulled a game out of the fire in the last seconds after defeating switzerland and czech republic in the group stage with last-gasp goals . " this is indescribable , " said turkey 's hamit altintop , who was voted man of the match .
" now anything can happen .
if we carry on like this and believe in ourselves then a lot can happen . " the late drama made up for an unattractive first 90 minutes in which croatia enjoyed the best of the opportunities . after the high-class first quarter-final between germany and portugal the previous evening in basel , the 51,428 capacity crowd in the ernst happel stadion had to endure a dull and disjointed game .
turkish omissions terim could perhaps excuse his side 's lack of cohesion after injuries and suspension forced him to reshuffle .
there was a new look to the defense , with emre asik and gokhan zan in the center , while veteran keeper rustu was recalled in place of suspended volkan demirel , who will also miss the semi-final unless his appeal against a two-match ban is upheld on monday . turkey will also be without arda turan , tuncay sanli and emre asik , who received their second booking of the tournament , while nihat kahveci , who was substituted with an injury , must be doubtful . terim said he had not yet thought about the players missing for the next game .
" i have n't been able to do any damage assessment yet . " emre , tuncay and arda will be suspended for the semi-final ... we will see about that , " he said . turkey began brightly and hamit altintop fired wide from 20 meters , but croatia looked more threatening , and olic should have opened the scoring in the 19th minute when luka modric found him in the area with a low cross but the sv hamburg striker blasted over from six meters in one of the misses of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia thought they had a sure thing for a while turkey rarely got forward after the break but remained stubborn in defense and croatia , who had looked so inventive in defeating germany 2-1 , found it hard to create any danger . olic and ivan rakitic had opportunities and a free-kick outside the box from darijo srna six minutes from time was well saved by rustu . the 35-year-old keeper , turkey 's most-capped player in his 117th game , had experienced some uncertain moments but then thwarted modric from close range in the final minute to take the game into extra-time .
croatia thought they were through croatian fans in the stadium , who had been lighting flares in the stands , raised the noise levels in the extra period after turkey began to look more enterprising , and semih fired over the bar before sanli narrowly shot wide of the post . but when rustu left his goal but failed to get the ball near the byline ahead of modric , substitute klasnic took full advantage to head modric 's cross into the empty net . but there was still time for rustu to make amends for the error as it was his long ball downfield which eventually broke to semih to blast the ball into the top corner of the net . until that moment , croatia were already eyeing up a return match with germany in the semi-final in basel next wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olic missed his chance but perhaps shocked by semih 's equalizer , modric and rakitic both missed the goal completely from the spot while srna converted his and substitute mladen petric saw rustu save his effort . turan , semih and altintop all converted their penalties for turkey to secure a remarkable victory . " this is football , you should never give up until the end , until the referee blows the final whistle , " said terim .
" that is why it is such an interesting game . " dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

advertisement scenes from the torch relay in lhasa the olympic torch has been carried through the tibetan provincial capital of lhasa amid heavy security .
the 11km -lrb- seven mile -rrb- parade passed off smoothly , with the flame carried past apparently hand-picked spectators .
the bbc 's james reynolds says there is a staggering security presence in the city , three months after violent protests broke out .
ethnic tibetans clashed with security forces and han chinese in march in the biggest protests for two decades .
foreign journalists have been barred from lhasa since the unrest .
but reporters representing about 30 international news organisations have been allowed into the city in a closely monitored group to cover the torch relay - widely considered the most sensitive leg of the flame 's journey around the world and through china .
' vetting ' torch bearers in white-and-red track suits carried the olympic flame through lhasa 's streets , beginning at norbulingka , the former summer palace of the dalai lama , the tibetan spiritual leader now living in exile in india .
we saw very clearly several dozen soldiers wearing riot gear - a reminder that lhasa is not a normal city james reynolds reynolds ' china : inside lhasa in pictures : lhasa relay our correspondent says he passed through at least six checkpoints as he was driven in an official convoy to the start of the relay .
each member of the crowd has a badge , suggesting that spectators were specially chosen or vetted for the ceremony , he says .
the lhasa relay is important for beijing because it wants to show that tibet is very much a part of china , he adds .
after being taken through the city 's streets , the flame was brought to a closing ceremony where officials were giving speeches at the iconic hilltop potala palace , the traditional seat of tibetan rulers .
on the eve of the parade , small crowds of people were wandering in the square in front of the palace , as performers practised for the ceremonies , our correspondent says .
but he says he also saw four military trucks near the area - two of which were filled with soldiers in riot gear .
ahead of the event , palma trily , vice-governor of the beijing-backed tibetan government , said he was confident the relay would pass through the city without incident .
" we have sufficient confidence and capability to turn tomorrow 's lhasa torch relay into a big success , " the associated press quoted him as saying on friday .
a planned three-day stay in tibet has been cut to one day because of schedule adjustments linked to last month 's sichuan earthquake , officials said .
in a separate development , the state-run xinhua news agency reported on friday that more than 1,000 people detained after the protests in tibet had been freed .
it quoted a senior official as saying 116 people remained in custody awaiting trial over the unrest .

ethnic tibetans clashed with security forces and han chinese in march in the biggest protests for two decades .
foreign journalists have been barred from lhasa since the unrest .
but reporters representing about 30 international news organisations have been allowed into the city in a closely monitored group to cover the torch relay - widely considered the most sensitive leg of the flame 's journey around the world and through china .
' vetting ' torch bearers in white-and-red track suits carried the olympic flame through lhasa 's streets , beginning at norbulingka , the former summer palace of the dalai lama , the tibetan spiritual leader now living in exile in india .
we saw very clearly several dozen soldiers wearing riot gear - a reminder that lhasa is not a normal city james reynolds reynolds ' china : inside lhasa in pictures : lhasa relay our correspondent says he passed through at least six checkpoints as he was driven in an official convoy to the start of the relay .
each member of the crowd has a badge , suggesting that spectators were specially chosen or vetted for the ceremony , he says .
the lhasa relay is important for beijing because it wants to show that tibet is very much a part of china , he adds .
after being taken through the city 's streets , the flame was brought to a closing ceremony where officials were giving speeches at the iconic hilltop potala palace , the traditional seat of tibetan rulers .
on the eve of the parade , small crowds of people were wandering in the square in front of the palace , as performers practised for the ceremonies , our correspondent says .
but he says he also saw four military trucks near the area - two of which were filled with soldiers in riot gear .
ahead of the event , palma trily , vice-governor of the beijing-backed tibetan government , said he was confident the relay would pass through the city without incident .
" we have sufficient confidence and capability to turn tomorrow 's lhasa torch relay into a big success , " the associated press quoted him as saying on friday .
a planned three-day stay in tibet has been cut to one day because of schedule adjustments linked to last month 's sichuan earthquake , officials said .
in a separate development , the state-run xinhua news agency reported on friday that more than 1,000 people detained after the protests in tibet had been freed .
it quoted a senior official as saying 116 people remained in custody awaiting trial over the unrest .

the unit , eira - welsh for snow - will offer a new genetic therapy to patients who use the north wales cancer treatment centre in denbighshire .
it will also see more people treated at the glan clwyd hospital site .
the project has been funded through donations , including money raised by rock star mike peters , who is returning to snowdon to raise more funds .
last year , the alarm star raised funds by holding the highest-ever concert on everest , and on saturday he is on snowdon for a second time for a special acoustic performance on the mountain 's summit .
peters is still undergoing long-term maintenance treatment after being diagnosed and successfully treated twice for leukaemia .
eira is being built as an extension to the heulwen day unit at the hospital in bodelwyddan , and its name continues the weather-related theme at the cancer centre .
one ward , named heulwen , means sunshine and another , enfys , is rainbow .
new therapies one of the major developments at the new unit will be an antibody treatment room , which officials hope will be ready for its first patients by christmas .
the antibody therapy is a new treatment where cells are genetically engineered in a laboratory and are designed to prompt the immune system to directly attack cancers .
the therapy can also help block the signals to cancer cells that cause them to grow .
" these new therapies can sometimes take many hours to administer to the patient and these extra bed spaces will ensure that all patients are treated on a bed , enabling them to have their treatment safely in comfortable surroundings , " explained lead chemotherapy nurse pat pilkington .
" there will also be an emergency triage room where patients can be assessed by skilled oncology nurses and doctors , and emergency treatment delivered immediately if required . "
jacqueline thompson , from nearby st asaph , is one of the patients who has been receiving chemotherapy at the cancer centre and is now on the antibody treatment .
she said the new unit would be vital for the area , adding : " being able to have this treatment locally has been a real boost for me and my family . "

the unit , eira - welsh for snow - will offer a new genetic therapy to patients who use the north wales cancer treatment centre in denbighshire .
it will also see more people treated at the glan clwyd hospital site .
the project has been funded through donations , including money raised by rock star mike peters , who is returning to snowdon to raise more funds .
last year , the alarm star raised funds by holding the highest-ever concert on everest , and on saturday he is on snowdon for a second time for a special acoustic performance on the mountain 's summit .
peters is still undergoing long-term maintenance treatment after being diagnosed and successfully treated twice for leukaemia .
eira is being built as an extension to the heulwen day unit at the hospital in bodelwyddan , and its name continues the weather-related theme at the cancer centre .
one ward , named heulwen , means sunshine and another , enfys , is rainbow .
new therapies one of the major developments at the new unit will be an antibody treatment room , which officials hope will be ready for its first patients by christmas .
the antibody therapy is a new treatment where cells are genetically engineered in a laboratory and are designed to prompt the immune system to directly attack cancers .
the therapy can also help block the signals to cancer cells that cause them to grow .
" these new therapies can sometimes take many hours to administer to the patient and these extra bed spaces will ensure that all patients are treated on a bed , enabling them to have their treatment safely in comfortable surroundings , " explained lead chemotherapy nurse pat pilkington .
" there will also be an emergency triage room where patients can be assessed by skilled oncology nurses and doctors , and emergency treatment delivered immediately if required . "
jacqueline thompson , from nearby st asaph , is one of the patients who has been receiving chemotherapy at the cancer centre and is now on the antibody treatment .
she said the new unit would be vital for the area , adding : " being able to have this treatment locally has been a real boost for me and my family . "

defendants in criminal trials now have a legal right to know the identity of witnesses testifying against them .
john yates told the daily telegraph convicted criminals could appeal and be freed if witnesses refused to reveal their identities in a retrial .
ministers said the issue of protecting witness identities would be addressed .
police in london believe up to 40 criminals could now launch appeals , the telegraph reports .
mr yates , who is assistant commissioner of the met , made his comments after iain davis ' double murder conviction was quashed by the law lords .
he said : " a lot of good work being undone , and this will play out so badly in terms of those we are trying to reach out to in communities .
it almost feels like we have broken our word .
" to see clearly guilty people walking free is just awful .
from the today programme more from today programme " special measures are only used in the most extreme cases , which means these are our most dangerous criminals , people who have been jailed for up to 40 years .
and they could be walking free . "
justice secretary jack straw told bbc radio 4 's today programme the issue of protecting witness identities would be addressed " very urgently " .
" it is fundamental that defendants should be able literally to see and hear the evidence before them .
" but you have to balance that against what actually happens in real life these days where you 've got very serious gun and drug crime and there is a such a high level of fear . "
anonymous evidence davis was convicted of killing of two men in a shooting at a flat in hackney , east london , on new year 's day 2002 .
at the trial in 2004 , seven witnesses claimed to be in fear for their lives if it became known that they had given evidence against davis .
in order to persuade them to give evidence against the accused , trial judge david paget qc allowed witnesses anonymity .
without the evidence of three of the witnesses , davis would not have been convicted , said lord bingham , the head of the panel of judges who sit at the country 's highest court , at the house of lords .
but he ruled : " i feel bound to conclude that the protective measures imposed by the court in this case hampered the conduct of the defence in a manner and to an extent which was unlawful and rendered the trial unfair . "
he , along with four other law lords , allowed davis ' appeal and sent the case back to the court of appeal , which was asked to quash the conviction .
it was also asked to decide whether to order a retrial if an application was made by the prosecution .

over the next 10 years , burberry has promised to hand over £ 1.5m to help train and educate communities hit by the factory 's closure .
the process of bidding for that cash is now under way .
the fund is open to anyone in the area , with up to £ 2,500 available for people to boost their skills .
joan young , a former burberry worker and now one of six members of the rhondda trust , said the money would help to change people 's lives .
" if you want to become a carpenter and you have to buy the tools , or a plumber perhaps , we will be able to look towards giving them grants towards their tools or training , " she explained . "
it is something for us to have for free , so let 's enjoy spending it , and giving it to the local community " joan young , rhondda trust " individuals will be able to apply for a grant of £ 2,500 per annum .
i think this will be very good for the youngsters here . "
but the funds are not just for training young people in the rhondda , insisted local mp chris bryant .
" whether you are a youngster thinking about a gap year and they want a bit of money to go look at ice flows in patagonia , or it 's an old people 's group who want to make sure all their members have it skills , or someone who wants to set up a new youth club - these are the things we are looking to fund , " he said .
" i hope this will be a seed over the next 10 years that will transform some people 's lives . "
the fashion giant agreed to give £ 150,000 every year for the next decade to the community after it shut the factory last march with 300 job losses .
production of the company 's polo shirts was transferred to china .
but the decision sparked a wave of protest that spread internationally , with campaigners winning the support of celebrities , including emma thompson , rhys ifans , sir tom jones , and manchester united manager sir alex ferguson .
part-time work mrs young said a year on , the communities that worked for burberry were now looking to the future , but it had been difficult for some .
" many of them have found jobs , but we 've found that the girls have a lot of part-time work - it 's not full-time employment , " she said .
" for some , the closure of burberry has turned out to be a good thing .
burberry 's was on our doorstep and we just stayed there .
" now some of them have looked outside of the factory for work - and found better jobs . "
the trustee also urged people to get their grant applications in as soon as possible , with a deadline in august .
" it is something for us to have for free , so let 's enjoy spending it , and giving it to the local community , the two valleys , rhondda fawr and fach , " she enthused .

over the next 10 years , burberry has promised to hand over £ 1.5m to help train and educate communities hit by the factory 's closure .
the process of bidding for that cash is now under way .
the fund is open to anyone in the area , with up to £ 2,500 available for people to boost their skills .
joan young , a former burberry worker and now one of six members of the rhondda trust , said the money would help to change people 's lives .
" if you want to become a carpenter and you have to buy the tools , or a plumber perhaps , we will be able to look towards giving them grants towards their tools or training , " she explained .
it is something for us to have for free , so let 's enjoy spending it , and giving it to the local community joan young , rhondda trust " individuals will be able to apply for a grant of £ 2,500 per annum .
i think this will be very good for the youngsters here . "
but the funds are not just for training young people in the rhondda , insisted local mp chris bryant .
" whether you are a youngster thinking about a gap year and they want a bit of money to go look at ice flows in patagonia , or it 's an old people 's group who want to make sure all their members have it skills , or someone who wants to set up a new youth club - these are the things we are looking to fund , " he said .
the protests against the closure were backed in london and new york " i hope this will be a seed over the next 10 years that will transform some people 's lives . "
the fashion giant agreed to give £ 150,000 every year for the next decade to the community after it shut the factory last march with 300 job losses .
production of the company 's polo shirts was transferred to china .
but the decision sparked a wave of protest that spread internationally , with campaigners winning the support of celebrities , including emma thompson , rhys ifans , sir tom jones , and manchester united manager sir alex ferguson .
part-time work mrs young said a year on , the communities that worked for burberry were now looking to the future , but it had been difficult for some .
" many of them have found jobs , but we 've found that the girls have a lot of part-time work - it 's not full-time employment , " she said .
" for some , the closure of burberry has turned out to be a good thing .
burberry 's was on our doorstep and we just stayed there .
" now some of them have looked outside of the factory for work - and found better jobs . "
the trustee also urged people to get their grant applications in as soon as possible , with a deadline in august .
" it is something for us to have for free , so let 's enjoy spending it , and giving it to the local community , the two valleys , rhondda fawr and fach , " she enthused .
