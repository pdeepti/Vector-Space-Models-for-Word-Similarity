such a decision would allow the eu 's executive , the european commission , to begin talks with the russian government on a political deal covering cooperation and consultation on a range of issues , from energy and security policy to education and scientific research .
relations between russia and the eu are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- signed with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 and designed to run for 10 years .
since the pca was signed , russia has become much more assertive of its perceived rights in europe , while the eu has expanded to take in 10 new members from the former communist bloc in an arc sweeping from the baltic states to bulgaria .
both sides say it is time for a new deal which would better reflect their current positions and priorities .
difficulties along the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia will also be on the table the eu has found it difficult to reach an agreement on launching talks .
first , poland blocked any such move in protest at a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
while the polish meat ban has since been lifted , lithuania is now threatening to veto the opening of talks in protest at russia 's shut-off - allegedly for technical reasons - of the pipeline feeding russian oil to lithuania 's only oil refinery .
vilnius claims that the shut-off of july 2006 , only two months after the lithuanian government allowed the sale of the refinery to poland 's pkn orlen company , was politically motivated .
lithuanian diplomats also insist that the eu include the issue of the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia 's breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia in its negotiating mandate .
the negotiating mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's successor dmitry medvedev -lrb- right -rrb- will meet with eu officials in june to address those concerns , eu diplomats have agreed to include the term " frozen conflicts " in the negotiating mandate and to append two declarations to it - one on energy security and one on the pipeline issue .
presidency officials now hope that experts from the eu and russia will be able to begin talks on the new agreement before a summit scheduled for late june in siberia - the first top-level meeting with russia 's newly-elected president dmitry medvedev .
at the end of tuesday 's meeting , representatives of the commission and the presidency - currently held by slovenia - are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 27.04.2008 activists want more from proposed eu ban on seal products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal activists want the eu to implement a complete ban on seal hunting animal rights groups fear the move by the european commission to seek a ban on the import of " inhumane " seal products may not prevent the annual cull in canada . environment commissioner dimas " intends to come forward with legislation which bans the importation and sale of products derived from seals that had been ... inhumanely killed , " his spokeswoman barbara helfferich told reporters in brussels .
she did not say when such legislation might be presented to the european parliament and the 27 eu member states .
experts suggest an eu ban would be very important as europe is a major importer of seal products .
some eu nations , including belgium and the netherlands , have already introduced their own bans , she said .
even the threat of an eu-wide ban has already brought down prices , and this is making the seal hunt less economically attractive .
unworkable ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is focusing on products from inhumane killing activists fear that any ban will come with a proviso which will make it practically unworkable and ineffective , british green mep caroline lucas said .
" what we are hearing is that -lsb- eu environment commissioner stavros -rsb- dimas plans to include the proviso that the ban will apply where the animals have been inhumanely killed , " she said .
" the number of police you would need to demonstrate that is in the realms of fantasy , " she argued .
" the seal hunt is routinely inhumane .
when you are on slippery ice and they are moving and you are moving it is practically impossible to ensure that a seal is humanely killed . "
animal welfare groups want total ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists say the decrease in the cull is down to protests the canadian fisheries ministry said the number of boats taking part in the first fortnight of the spring hunt this year was markedly down on previous years .
local media attribute the change to rising oil costs and lower prices for seal fur .
but the opponents of the hunt said it was a result of their protests .
" we want a total ban which applies to all countries involved in commercial hunting " of young seals for their pelts , the international fund for animal welfare -lsb- ifaw -rsb- said , citing canada but also russia , finland and denmark with greenland .
the campaign group showed the eu footage taken in canada last month of baby seals being shot from a hunter aboard ships then clubbed or simply skinned while still alive .
canada has increased its quota of seals to be hunted to 275,000 this year from 270,000 .
the annual commercial seal hunt , which opened march 28 in the gulf of saint lawrence , is often marked by confrontations between animal rights protesters and the hunters and canadian authorities . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.04.2008 eu hopes to launch talks on strategic russia partnership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the european union , strategic partnership with russia is of paramount importance the european union hopes to launch talks on a wide-ranging political deal with russia this week despite mounting tensions over trade , energy and foreign policy . at a meeting on tuesday , april 29 , in luxembourg , the foreign ministers of the bloc 's 27 member states are " expected to adopt ... negotiating directives for a new agreement to provide a comprehensive framework for eu-russia relations , " officials from the eu presidency , which chairs such meetings , said on friday .
such a decision would allow the eu 's executive , the european commission , to begin talks with the russian government on a political deal covering cooperation and consultation on a range of issues , from energy and security policy to education and scientific research .
relations between russia and the eu are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- signed with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 and designed to run for 10 years .
since the pca was signed , russia has become much more assertive of its perceived rights in europe , while the eu has expanded to take in 10 new members from the former communist bloc in an arc sweeping from the baltic states to bulgaria .
both sides say it is time for a new deal which would better reflect their current positions and priorities .
difficulties along the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia will also be on the table the eu has found it difficult to reach an agreement on launching talks .
first , poland blocked any such move in protest at a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
while the polish meat ban has since been lifted , lithuania is now threatening to veto the opening of talks in protest at russia 's shut-off - allegedly for technical reasons - of the pipeline feeding russian oil to lithuania 's only oil refinery .
vilnius claims that the shut-off of july 2006 , only two months after the lithuanian government allowed the sale of the refinery to poland 's pkn orlen company , was politically motivated .
lithuanian diplomats also insist that the eu include the issue of the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia 's breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia in its negotiating mandate .
the negotiating mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's successor dmitry medvedev -lrb- right -rrb- will meet with eu officials in june to address those concerns , eu diplomats have agreed to include the term " frozen conflicts " in the negotiating mandate and to append two declarations to it - one on energy security and one on the pipeline issue .
presidency officials now hope that experts from the eu and russia will be able to begin talks on the new agreement before a summit scheduled for late june in siberia - the first top-level meeting with russia 's newly-elected president dmitry medvedev .
at the end of tuesday 's meeting , representatives of the commission and the presidency - currently held by slovenia - are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
diplomats say that the signing of a pca would give both sides an opportunity to discuss their differences in a less confrontational way . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

such a decision would allow the eu 's executive , the european commission , to begin talks with the russian government on a political deal covering cooperation and consultation on a range of issues , from energy and security policy to education and scientific research .
relations between russia and the eu are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- signed with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 and designed to run for 10 years .
since the pca was signed , russia has become much more assertive of its perceived rights in europe , while the eu has expanded to take in 10 new members from the former communist bloc in an arc sweeping from the baltic states to bulgaria .
both sides say it is time for a new deal which would better reflect their current positions and priorities .
difficulties along the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia will also be on the table the eu has found it difficult to reach an agreement on launching talks .
first , poland blocked any such move in protest at a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
while the polish meat ban has since been lifted , lithuania is now threatening to veto the opening of talks in protest at russia 's shut-off - allegedly for technical reasons - of the pipeline feeding russian oil to lithuania 's only oil refinery .
vilnius claims that the shut-off of july 2006 , only two months after the lithuanian government allowed the sale of the refinery to poland 's pkn orlen company , was politically motivated .
lithuanian diplomats also insist that the eu include the issue of the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia 's breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia in its negotiating mandate .
the negotiating mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's successor dmitry medvedev -lrb- right -rrb- will meet with eu officials in june to address those concerns , eu diplomats have agreed to include the term " frozen conflicts " in the negotiating mandate and to append two declarations to it - one on energy security and one on the pipeline issue .
presidency officials now hope that experts from the eu and russia will be able to begin talks on the new agreement before a summit scheduled for late june in siberia - the first top-level meeting with russia 's newly-elected president dmitry medvedev .
at the end of tuesday 's meeting , representatives of the commission and the presidency - currently held by slovenia - are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 27.04.2008 activists want more from proposed eu ban on seal products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal activists want the eu to implement a complete ban on seal hunting animal rights groups fear the move by the european commission to seek a ban on the import of " inhumane " seal products may not prevent the annual cull in canada . environment commissioner dimas " intends to come forward with legislation which bans the importation and sale of products derived from seals that had been ... inhumanely killed , " his spokeswoman barbara helfferich told reporters in brussels .
she did not say when such legislation might be presented to the european parliament and the 27 eu member states .
experts suggest an eu ban would be very important as europe is a major importer of seal products .
some eu nations , including belgium and the netherlands , have already introduced their own bans , she said .
even the threat of an eu-wide ban has already brought down prices , and this is making the seal hunt less economically attractive .
unworkable ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is focusing on products from inhumane killing activists fear that any ban will come with a proviso which will make it practically unworkable and ineffective , british green mep caroline lucas said .
" what we are hearing is that -lsb- eu environment commissioner stavros -rsb- dimas plans to include the proviso that the ban will apply where the animals have been inhumanely killed , " she said .
" the number of police you would need to demonstrate that is in the realms of fantasy , " she argued .
" the seal hunt is routinely inhumane .
when you are on slippery ice and they are moving and you are moving it is practically impossible to ensure that a seal is humanely killed . "
animal welfare groups want total ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists say the decrease in the cull is down to protests the canadian fisheries ministry said the number of boats taking part in the first fortnight of the spring hunt this year was markedly down on previous years .
local media attribute the change to rising oil costs and lower prices for seal fur .
but the opponents of the hunt said it was a result of their protests .
" we want a total ban which applies to all countries involved in commercial hunting " of young seals for their pelts , the international fund for animal welfare -lsb- ifaw -rsb- said , citing canada but also russia , finland and denmark with greenland .
the campaign group showed the eu footage taken in canada last month of baby seals being shot from a hunter aboard ships then clubbed or simply skinned while still alive .
canada has increased its quota of seals to be hunted to 275,000 this year from 270,000 .
the annual commercial seal hunt , which opened march 28 in the gulf of saint lawrence , is often marked by confrontations between animal rights protesters and the hunters and canadian authorities . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

such a decision would allow the eu 's executive , the european commission , to begin talks with the russian government on a political deal covering cooperation and consultation on a range of issues , from energy and security policy to education and scientific research .
relations between russia and the eu are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- signed with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 and designed to run for 10 years .
since the pca was signed , russia has become much more assertive of its perceived rights in europe , while the eu has expanded to take in 10 new members from the former communist bloc in an arc sweeping from the baltic states to bulgaria .
both sides say it is time for a new deal which would better reflect their current positions and priorities .

while the polish meat ban has since been lifted , lithuania is now threatening to veto the opening of talks in protest at russia 's shut-off - allegedly for technical reasons - of the pipeline feeding russian oil to lithuania 's only oil refinery .
vilnius claims that the shut-off of july 2006 , only two months after the lithuanian government allowed the sale of the refinery to poland 's pkn orlen company , was politically motivated .
lithuanian diplomats also insist that the eu include the issue of the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia 's breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia in its negotiating mandate .
the negotiating mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's successor dmitry medvedev -lrb- right -rrb- will meet with eu officials in june to address those concerns , eu diplomats have agreed to include the term " frozen conflicts " in the negotiating mandate and to append two declarations to it - one on energy security and one on the pipeline issue .
presidency officials now hope that experts from the eu and russia will be able to begin talks on the new agreement before a summit scheduled for late june in siberia - the first top-level meeting with russia 's newly-elected president dmitry medvedev .
at the end of tuesday 's meeting , representatives of the commission and the presidency - currently held by slovenia - are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .

such a decision would allow the eu 's executive , the european commission , to begin talks with the russian government on a political deal covering cooperation and consultation on a range of issues , from energy and security policy to education and scientific research .
relations between russia and the eu are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- signed with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 and designed to run for 10 years .
since the pca was signed , russia has become much more assertive of its perceived rights in europe , while the eu has expanded to take in 10 new members from the former communist bloc in an arc sweeping from the baltic states to bulgaria .
both sides say it is time for a new deal which would better reflect their current positions and priorities .
difficulties along the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia will also be on the table the eu has found it difficult to reach an agreement on launching talks .
first , poland blocked any such move in protest at a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
while the polish meat ban has since been lifted , lithuania is now threatening to veto the opening of talks in protest at russia 's shut-off - allegedly for technical reasons - of the pipeline feeding russian oil to lithuania 's only oil refinery .

she did not say when such legislation might be presented to the european parliament and the 27 eu member states .
experts suggest an eu ban would be very important as europe is a major importer of seal products .
some eu nations , including belgium and the netherlands , have already introduced their own bans , she said .
even the threat of an eu-wide ban has already brought down prices , and this is making the seal hunt less economically attractive .

" the number of police you would need to demonstrate that is in the realms of fantasy , " she argued .
" the seal hunt is routinely inhumane .
when you are on slippery ice and they are moving and you are moving it is practically impossible to ensure that a seal is humanely killed . "

canada has increased its quota of seals to be hunted to 275,000 this year from 270,000 .

such a decision would allow the eu 's executive , the european commission , to begin talks with the russian government on a political deal covering cooperation and consultation on a range of issues , from energy and security policy to education and scientific research .
relations between russia and the eu are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- signed with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 and designed to run for 10 years .
since the pca was signed , russia has become much more assertive of its perceived rights in europe , while the eu has expanded to take in 10 new members from the former communist bloc in an arc sweeping from the baltic states to bulgaria .
both sides say it is time for a new deal which would better reflect their current positions and priorities .
difficulties along the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia will also be on the table the eu has found it difficult to reach an agreement on launching talks .
first , poland blocked any such move in protest at a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
while the polish meat ban has since been lifted , lithuania is now threatening to veto the opening of talks in protest at russia 's shut-off - allegedly for technical reasons - of the pipeline feeding russian oil to lithuania 's only oil refinery .
vilnius claims that the shut-off of july 2006 , only two months after the lithuanian government allowed the sale of the refinery to poland 's pkn orlen company , was politically motivated .
lithuanian diplomats also insist that the eu include the issue of the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia 's breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia in its negotiating mandate .
the negotiating mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's successor dmitry medvedev -lrb- right -rrb- will meet with eu officials in june to address those concerns , eu diplomats have agreed to include the term " frozen conflicts " in the negotiating mandate and to append two declarations to it - one on energy security and one on the pipeline issue .
presidency officials now hope that experts from the eu and russia will be able to begin talks on the new agreement before a summit scheduled for late june in siberia - the first top-level meeting with russia 's newly-elected president dmitry medvedev .
at the end of tuesday 's meeting , representatives of the commission and the presidency - currently held by slovenia - are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .

such a decision would allow the eu 's executive , the european commission , to begin talks with the russian government on a political deal covering cooperation and consultation on a range of issues , from energy and security policy to education and scientific research .
relations between russia and the eu are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- signed with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 and designed to run for 10 years .
since the pca was signed , russia has become much more assertive of its perceived rights in europe , while the eu has expanded to take in 10 new members from the former communist bloc in an arc sweeping from the baltic states to bulgaria .
both sides say it is time for a new deal which would better reflect their current positions and priorities .
difficulties along the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia will also be on the table the eu has found it difficult to reach an agreement on launching talks .
first , poland blocked any such move in protest at a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
while the polish meat ban has since been lifted , lithuania is now threatening to veto the opening of talks in protest at russia 's shut-off - allegedly for technical reasons - of the pipeline feeding russian oil to lithuania 's only oil refinery .
vilnius claims that the shut-off of july 2006 , only two months after the lithuanian government allowed the sale of the refinery to poland 's pkn orlen company , was politically motivated .
lithuanian diplomats also insist that the eu include the issue of the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia 's breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia in its negotiating mandate .
the negotiating mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's successor dmitry medvedev -lrb- right -rrb- will meet with eu officials in june to address those concerns , eu diplomats have agreed to include the term " frozen conflicts " in the negotiating mandate and to append two declarations to it - one on energy security and one on the pipeline issue .
presidency officials now hope that experts from the eu and russia will be able to begin talks on the new agreement before a summit scheduled for late june in siberia - the first top-level meeting with russia 's newly-elected president dmitry medvedev .
at the end of tuesday 's meeting , representatives of the commission and the presidency - currently held by slovenia - are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
diplomats say that the signing of a pca would give both sides an opportunity to discuss their differences in a less confrontational way . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she did not say when such legislation might be presented to the european parliament and the 27 eu member states .
experts suggest an eu ban would be very important as europe is a major importer of seal products .
some eu nations , including belgium and the netherlands , have already introduced their own bans , she said .

" the seal hunt is routinely inhumane .
when you are on slippery ice and they are moving and you are moving it is practically impossible to ensure that a seal is humanely killed . "

the campaign group showed the eu footage taken in canada last month of baby seals being shot from a hunter aboard ships then clubbed or simply skinned while still alive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.04.2008 eu hopes to launch talks on strategic russia partnership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the european union , strategic partnership with russia is of paramount importance the european union hopes to launch talks on a wide-ranging political deal with russia this week despite mounting tensions over trade , energy and foreign policy . at a meeting on tuesday , april 29 , in luxembourg , the foreign ministers of the bloc 's 27 member states are " expected to adopt ... negotiating directives for a new agreement to provide a comprehensive framework for eu-russia relations , " officials from the eu presidency , which chairs such meetings , said on friday .
such a decision would allow the eu 's executive , the european commission , to begin talks with the russian government on a political deal covering cooperation and consultation on a range of issues , from energy and security policy to education and scientific research .
relations between russia and the eu are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- signed with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 and designed to run for 10 years .
since the pca was signed , russia has become much more assertive of its perceived rights in europe , while the eu has expanded to take in 10 new members from the former communist bloc in an arc sweeping from the baltic states to bulgaria .
both sides say it is time for a new deal which would better reflect their current positions and priorities .
difficulties along the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia will also be on the table the eu has found it difficult to reach an agreement on launching talks .
first , poland blocked any such move in protest at a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
while the polish meat ban has since been lifted , lithuania is now threatening to veto the opening of talks in protest at russia 's shut-off - allegedly for technical reasons - of the pipeline feeding russian oil to lithuania 's only oil refinery .
vilnius claims that the shut-off of july 2006 , only two months after the lithuanian government allowed the sale of the refinery to poland 's pkn orlen company , was politically motivated .
lithuanian diplomats also insist that the eu include the issue of the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia 's breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia in its negotiating mandate .
the negotiating mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's successor dmitry medvedev -lrb- right -rrb- will meet with eu officials in june to address those concerns , eu diplomats have agreed to include the term " frozen conflicts " in the negotiating mandate and to append two declarations to it - one on energy security and one on the pipeline issue .
presidency officials now hope that experts from the eu and russia will be able to begin talks on the new agreement before a summit scheduled for late june in siberia - the first top-level meeting with russia 's newly-elected president dmitry medvedev .
at the end of tuesday 's meeting , representatives of the commission and the presidency - currently held by slovenia - are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
diplomats say that the signing of a pca would give both sides an opportunity to discuss their differences in a less confrontational way . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she did not say when such legislation might be presented to the european parliament and the 27 eu member states .
experts suggest an eu ban would be very important as europe is a major importer of seal products .
some eu nations , including belgium and the netherlands , have already introduced their own bans , she said .
even the threat of an eu-wide ban has already brought down prices , and this is making the seal hunt less economically attractive .

" the number of police you would need to demonstrate that is in the realms of fantasy , " she argued .
" the seal hunt is routinely inhumane .
when you are on slippery ice and they are moving and you are moving it is practically impossible to ensure that a seal is humanely killed . "

the campaign group showed the eu footage taken in canada last month of baby seals being shot from a hunter aboard ships then clubbed or simply skinned while still alive .
canada has increased its quota of seals to be hunted to 275,000 this year from 270,000 .

such a decision would allow the eu 's executive , the european commission , to begin talks with the russian government on a political deal covering cooperation and consultation on a range of issues , from energy and security policy to education and scientific research .
relations between russia and the eu are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- signed with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 and designed to run for 10 years .
since the pca was signed , russia has become much more assertive of its perceived rights in europe , while the eu has expanded to take in 10 new members from the former communist bloc in an arc sweeping from the baltic states to bulgaria .
both sides say it is time for a new deal which would better reflect their current positions and priorities .
difficulties along the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia will also be on the table the eu has found it difficult to reach an agreement on launching talks .
first , poland blocked any such move in protest at a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
while the polish meat ban has since been lifted , lithuania is now threatening to veto the opening of talks in protest at russia 's shut-off - allegedly for technical reasons - of the pipeline feeding russian oil to lithuania 's only oil refinery .
vilnius claims that the shut-off of july 2006 , only two months after the lithuanian government allowed the sale of the refinery to poland 's pkn orlen company , was politically motivated .
lithuanian diplomats also insist that the eu include the issue of the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia 's breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia in its negotiating mandate .
the negotiating mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's successor dmitry medvedev -lrb- right -rrb- will meet with eu officials in june to address those concerns , eu diplomats have agreed to include the term " frozen conflicts " in the negotiating mandate and to append two declarations to it - one on energy security and one on the pipeline issue .
presidency officials now hope that experts from the eu and russia will be able to begin talks on the new agreement before a summit scheduled for late june in siberia - the first top-level meeting with russia 's newly-elected president dmitry medvedev .
at the end of tuesday 's meeting , representatives of the commission and the presidency - currently held by slovenia - are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .

such a decision would allow the eu 's executive , the european commission , to begin talks with the russian government on a political deal covering cooperation and consultation on a range of issues , from energy and security policy to education and scientific research .
relations between russia and the eu are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- signed with the government of boris yeltsin in 1997 and designed to run for 10 years .
since the pca was signed , russia has become much more assertive of its perceived rights in europe , while the eu has expanded to take in 10 new members from the former communist bloc in an arc sweeping from the baltic states to bulgaria .
both sides say it is time for a new deal which would better reflect their current positions and priorities .
difficulties along the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " frozen conflicts " in abkhazia and south ossetia will also be on the table the eu has found it difficult to reach an agreement on launching talks .
first , poland blocked any such move in protest at a russian import ban on polish meat and vegetable products .
while the polish meat ban has since been lifted , lithuania is now threatening to veto the opening of talks in protest at russia 's shut-off - allegedly for technical reasons - of the pipeline feeding russian oil to lithuania 's only oil refinery .
vilnius claims that the shut-off of july 2006 , only two months after the lithuanian government allowed the sale of the refinery to poland 's pkn orlen company , was politically motivated .
lithuanian diplomats also insist that the eu include the issue of the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia 's breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia in its negotiating mandate .
the negotiating mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's successor dmitry medvedev -lrb- right -rrb- will meet with eu officials in june to address those concerns , eu diplomats have agreed to include the term " frozen conflicts " in the negotiating mandate and to append two declarations to it - one on energy security and one on the pipeline issue .
presidency officials now hope that experts from the eu and russia will be able to begin talks on the new agreement before a summit scheduled for late june in siberia - the first top-level meeting with russia 's newly-elected president dmitry medvedev .
at the end of tuesday 's meeting , representatives of the commission and the presidency - currently held by slovenia - are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
diplomats say that the signing of a pca would give both sides an opportunity to discuss their differences in a less confrontational way . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the royal college of nursing -lrb- rcn -rrb- poll of more than 2,000 uk nurses cited washing and privacy as key issues .
the government said high quality care was a top priority , but a patients ' group said nurse standards had slipped .
the report comes as thousands of nurses gather in bournemouth for the rcn 's annual conference .
the four-day meeting will see a range of issues debated , from nhs targets to cleaning standards , ahead of a speech by health secretary alan johnson on wednesday . "
dignity should not be an afterthought or an optional extra " peter carter , rcn general secretary the nurses polled by the rcn highlighted a range of dignity issues that needed to be addressed .
in particular , they said hospitals were still not able to guarantee non-emergency patients single-sex accommodation despite long-running attempts by ministers .
they also pointed out that patient dignity was being hampered by a lack of specialist lifting equipment , ill-fitting bed curtains , insufficient washing and toilet facilities and staff shortages .
one nurse said : " patients seem to be becoming numbers not people .
i am having to fight against what the system wants in order to provide dignified care to my patients . "
in total , 81 % of those quizzed said they sometimes or always left their workplace feeling distressed or upset because they had not been able to give patients the kind of dignified care that they should .
and 86 % said dignity should be a higher priority .
respect peter carter , general secretary of the rcn , said : " dignity should not be an afterthought or an optional extra .
" each and every patient - whether they are in a hospital , a gp 's surgery , in the community or in a care home - deserves to be treated with dignity and respect .
" nurses are being asked to care for patients in wards that are really not properly equipped .
" for example , there are still copious examples of mixed toilets , washing and bathing facilities , which is very distressing to patients of both genders .
" there are examples where there are ill-fitting curtains around beds , and people using bedpans do n't have the privacy . "
but joyce robins , of patient concern , said : " while nurses are undoubtedly under pressure and the government could do more to help , i must say that we are increasingly hearing that patients are unhappy with the care they get from nurses .
" the perception of them has dropped and some of that is down to their own standards .
" in particular , they are being given more and more responsibility and i think there is a perception that nurses now feel they are above the basic care that is so important to patients and was always part of the nurse 's remit , things such as help at meal times and going to the toilet . "
charlotte potter , of the charity help the aged , said : " establishing and maintaining dignity for patients is an issue of paramount importance .
" nurses are key to ensuring dignity through care but they do not work in a vacuum .
if they do not receive appropriate support , patients will lose out . "
government response care services minister ivan lewis said : " nurses , like other nhs professionals , have a duty to treat patients with dignity at all times , however they also have a right to expect the necessary support and resources to make this possible .
" putting respect for dignity at the heart of patient care is now one of the top priorities for the nhs .
" over the last 18 months we have worked with the rcn and other groups to ensure that dignity is now on the agenda of every hospital and care home in the this country .
" in the next few weeks we will announce a major expansion of our dignity in care campaign and lord darzi 's next stage review of the nhs will highlight that personal care is not a luxury but integral to world-class clinical care . "
chief nursing officer christine beasley said : " i believe strongly that dignity , respect , care , and compassion are at the heart of good nursing care whenever and wherever it takes place .
" creating the conditions that will enable nurses to provide high quality and personalised nursing care has been a key theme of my work with nurse leaders this year .
" many are using initiatives like the productive wards programme to help nurses and other frontline staff find ways to release time to care . "

dignity should not be an afterthought or an optional extra peter carter , rcn general secretary the nurses polled by the rcn highlighted a range of dignity issues that needed to be addressed .
in particular , they said hospitals were still not able to guarantee non-emergency patients single-sex accommodation despite long-running attempts by ministers .
they also pointed out that patient dignity was being hampered by a lack of specialist lifting equipment , ill-fitting bed curtains , insufficient washing and toilet facilities and staff shortages .
one nurse said : " patients seem to be becoming numbers not people .
i am having to fight against what the system wants in order to provide dignified care to my patients . "
in total , 81 % of those quizzed said they sometimes or always left their workplace feeling distressed or upset because they had not been able to give patients the kind of dignified care that they should .
and 86 % said dignity should be a higher priority .
respect peter carter , general secretary of the rcn , said : " dignity should not be an afterthought or an optional extra .
" each and every patient - whether they are in a hospital , a gp 's surgery , in the community or in a care home - deserves to be treated with dignity and respect .

" there are examples where there are ill-fitting curtains around beds , and people using bedpans do n't have the privacy . "
but joyce robins , of patient concern , said : " while nurses are undoubtedly under pressure and the government could do more to help , i must say that we are increasingly hearing that patients are unhappy with the care they get from nurses .
" the perception of them has dropped and some of that is down to their own standards .

but what they lack in quantity our elections should make up for in interest .
the local authorities in question include the region 's two major cities , plymouth and exeter .
the third - weymouth & portland - is the main population centre in the marginal south dorset parliamentary constituency .
in plymouth , the power struggle is traditionally a two-party affair , with control seesawing between labour and the conservatives ever since the unitary authority was created eleven years ago .
in 2007 , a conservative victory put an end to four years of labour rule , while the liberal democrats lost their two seats to be left with no representation on the council .
exeter scalp over in exeter no party has had overall control of the city council for most of this decade .
the 2007 election claimed a prominent labour scalp , when the then group leader lost his seat to a liberal democrat challenger .
however , labour remains the largest group , albeit with two fewer seats .
the liberal democrats are snapping at their heels , with the conservatives in third place - though only just .
the " traditional " liberals - who objected to the merger with the sdp to form the liberal democrats in 1988 - also maintain a small presence in the council chamber .
weymouth council hung the third piece in the jigsaw , weymouth & portland borough council , is another hung council - and it has been that way for more than a generation .
here the conservatives edged into the lead last may , with the liberal democrats falling back to second place and labour a poor third .
it will be big news if any one party takes overall control of weymouth & portland for the first time since 1980 -lrb- when the conservatives lost power -rrb- .
dramatic changes here could also have a wider importance .
south west marginal the south dorset constituency is one of the region 's marginal seats .
sitting labour mp and schools minister jim knight first won it from the conservatives in 2001 by only 153 votes - labour 's smallest majority in england .
he increased this substantially to 1,812 in 2005 , but south dorset is still far from being a safe labour seat .
a surge by one of the main parties in weymouth & portland this thursday may hint at the direction the electorate is likely to take in the next general election .
and significant swings in marginals can make and unmake governments .
candidates standing a grand total of 177 candidates will be contesting the 46 seats on offer on may 1 .
labour and the conservatives are both contesting all 46 and the liberal democrats 41 .
after the three main parties , the largest numbers of candidates are being fielded by the green party -lrb- 16 -rrb- and the united kingdom independence party -lrb- 15 -rrb- .
ukip has two meps in the south west , but neither party currently has any councillors on the three councils up for election this week .
the liberals are fielding just four candidates - but have the consolation of already having four councillors on exeter city council .
the british national party is standing two candidates in plymouth .
and seven candidates are aiming to continue the longstanding west country tradition of being elected as an independent .

but what they lack in quantity our elections should make up for in interest .
the local authorities in question include the region 's two major cities , plymouth and exeter .
the third - weymouth & portland - is the main population centre in the marginal south dorset parliamentary constituency .
in plymouth , the power struggle is traditionally a two-party affair , with control seesawing between labour and the conservatives ever since the unitary authority was created eleven years ago .
in 2007 , a conservative victory put an end to four years of labour rule , while the liberal democrats lost their two seats to be left with no representation on the council .
exeter scalp over in exeter no party has had overall control of the city council for most of this decade .
the 2007 election claimed a prominent labour scalp , when the then group leader lost his seat to a liberal democrat challenger .
however , labour remains the largest group , albeit with two fewer seats .
the liberal democrats are snapping at their heels , with the conservatives in third place - though only just .
the " traditional " liberals - who objected to the merger with the sdp to form the liberal democrats in 1988 - also maintain a small presence in the council chamber .
weymouth council hung the third piece in the jigsaw , weymouth & portland borough council , is another hung council - and it has been that way for more than a generation .
here the conservatives edged into the lead last may , with the liberal democrats falling back to second place and labour a poor third .
it will be big news if any one party takes overall control of weymouth & portland for the first time since 1980 -lrb- when the conservatives lost power -rrb- .
dramatic changes here could also have a wider importance .
will south west councils remain hung ?
south west marginal the south dorset constituency is one of the region 's marginal seats .
sitting labour mp and schools minister jim knight first won it from the conservatives in 2001 by only 153 votes - labour 's smallest majority in england .
he increased this substantially to 1,812 in 2005 , but south dorset is still far from being a safe labour seat .
a surge by one of the main parties in weymouth & portland this thursday may hint at the direction the electorate is likely to take in the next general election .
and significant swings in marginals can make and unmake governments .
candidates standing a grand total of 177 candidates will be contesting the 46 seats on offer on may 1 .
labour and the conservatives are both contesting all 46 and the liberal democrats 41 .
after the three main parties , the largest numbers of candidates are being fielded by the green party -lrb- 16 -rrb- and the united kingdom independence party -lrb- 15 -rrb- .
ukip has two meps in the south west , but neither party currently has any councillors on the three councils up for election this week .
the liberals are fielding just four candidates - but have the consolation of already having four councillors on exeter city council .
the british national party is standing two candidates in plymouth .
and seven candidates are aiming to continue the longstanding west country tradition of being elected as an independent .

media requires javascript to play .
gunfire could be heard across the city gun battles between rival factions of a mexican drugs cartel have left at least 15 people dead in the city of tijuana , near the border with the us .
police said all the dead were from the arellano felix cartel , which has come under pressure from a rival gang .
two were wearing police uniforms or equipment , but are thought to have been gang members , police say .
drug-related violence is a serious issue across mexico .
nearly 200 people have been killed in tijuana this year .

some local authorities have used the regulation of investigatory powers act -lrb- ripa -rrb- more than 100 times in the last 12 months to conduct surveillance .
the findings , obtained by the press association news agency , come from 46 of the 468 local authorities in the uk .
privacy campaigners called for a " root and branch review " of the law .
earlier this month it emerged that poole borough council in dorset used ripa to spy on a family for three weeks to find out if they were really living in a school catchment area .
the council said the case was treated as potential criminal activity , which justified the use of the act .
less serious offences home office guidance says ripa allows " the interception of communications , carrying out of surveillance and the use of covert human intelligence sources " to help prevent crime , including terrorism .
the press association contacted 97 councils to find out how they were using the powers .
the 46 who responded said they had used the act a total of 1,343 times , mainly against rogue trading , benefit fraud and anti-social behaviour like criminal damage .
but some said the law was also used to find out about other less serious offences , such as : derby city council , bolton , gateshead and hartlepool used surveillance to investigate dog fouling .
bolton council also used the act to investigate littering .
the london borough of kensington and chelsea conducted surveillance on the misuse of a disabled parking badge .
liverpool city council used ripa to identify a false claim for damages .
conwy council used the law to spy on a person who was working while off sick .
the survey found the biggest user of ripa was durham county council , which used it 144 times in the last 12 months .
the council said it did not consider the use to be directed at members of the public , but against traders it had suspected of crime .
' petty and vindictive ' simon davies , director of campaign group privacy international , called for a review of ripa .
" ripa put physical surveillance on a legal basis but that does n't make it right or morally right - it just covers the back of local authorities , but at huge expense , " mr davies said .
there are strict rules to protect people from unnecessary intrusion sir simon milton local government authority " local authorities can be very petty and vindictive and they can become obsessed with issues like dog fouling and there can be a lack of judgment .
" in the case of dog fouling it 's almost morally justifiable to bring these people to book , but you have to ask the question is the response an overkill ?
" there are better ways to achieve the objectives without using counter-terrorism laws . "
shami chakrabarti , director of human rights group liberty , said : " you do n't use a sledgehammer to crack a nut , nor targeted surveillance to stop a litter bug .
" you can care about serious crime and terrorism without throwing away our personal privacy with a snoopers ' charter .
" the law must be reformed to require sign-off by judges not self authorisation by over-zealous bureaucrats . "
sir simon milton , local government association chairman , said councils were using the law to protect people against rip-off merchants , fly-tippers and benefit fraudsters .
" it 's wrong to suggest that these are specifically anti-terror powers , " he said .
" there are strict rules to protect people from unnecessary intrusion , and whenever a council applies to use these powers they must prove that it is both necessary and proportionate to the crime being investigated . "
out of the 97 councils contacted , 16 said they did not use the act at all , 19 asked for the request to be submitted under the freedom of information act and 16 did not respond .

some local authorities have used the regulation of investigatory powers act -lrb- ripa -rrb- more than 100 times in the last 12 months to conduct surveillance .
the findings , obtained by the press association news agency , come from 46 of the 468 local authorities in the uk .
privacy campaigners called for a " root and branch review " of the law .
earlier this month it emerged that poole borough council in dorset used ripa to spy on a family for three weeks to find out if they were really living in a school catchment area .
the council said the case was treated as potential criminal activity , which justified the use of the act .
less serious offences home office guidance says ripa allows " the interception of communications , carrying out of surveillance and the use of covert human intelligence sources " to help prevent crime , including terrorism .
the press association contacted 97 councils to find out how they were using the powers .
the 46 who responded said they had used the act a total of 1,343 times , mainly against rogue trading , benefit fraud and anti-social behaviour like criminal damage .
but some said the law was also used to find out about other less serious offences , such as : derby city council , bolton , gateshead and hartlepool used surveillance to investigate dog fouling .
bolton council also used the act to investigate littering .
the london borough of kensington and chelsea conducted surveillance on the misuse of a disabled parking badge .
liverpool city council used ripa to identify a false claim for damages .
conwy council used the law to spy on a person who was working while off sick .
the survey found the biggest user of ripa was durham county council , which used it 144 times in the last 12 months .
the council said it did not consider the use to be directed at members of the public , but against traders it had suspected of crime .
' petty and vindictive ' simon davies , director of campaign group privacy international , called for a review of ripa .
" ripa put physical surveillance on a legal basis but that does n't make it right or morally right - it just covers the back of local authorities , but at huge expense , " mr davies said .
there are strict rules to protect people from unnecessary intrusion sir simon milton local government authority " local authorities can be very petty and vindictive and they can become obsessed with issues like dog fouling and there can be a lack of judgment .
" in the case of dog fouling it 's almost morally justifiable to bring these people to book , but you have to ask the question is the response an overkill ?
" there are better ways to achieve the objectives without using counter-terrorism laws . "
shami chakrabarti , director of human rights group liberty , said : " you do n't use a sledgehammer to crack a nut , nor targeted surveillance to stop a litter bug .
" you can care about serious crime and terrorism without throwing away our personal privacy with a snoopers ' charter .
" the law must be reformed to require sign-off by judges not self authorisation by over-zealous bureaucrats . "
sir simon milton , local government association chairman , said councils were using the law to protect people against rip-off merchants , fly-tippers and benefit fraudsters .
" it 's wrong to suggest that these are specifically anti-terror powers , " he said .
" there are strict rules to protect people from unnecessary intrusion , and whenever a council applies to use these powers they must prove that it is both necessary and proportionate to the crime being investigated . "
out of the 97 councils contacted , 16 said they did not use the act at all , 19 asked for the request to be submitted under the freedom of information act and 16 did not respond .

bolton council also used the act to investigate littering .
the london borough of kensington and chelsea conducted surveillance on the misuse of a disabled parking badge .
liverpool city council used ripa to identify a false claim for damages .
conwy council used the law to spy on a person who was working while off sick .
the survey found the biggest user of ripa was durham county council , which used it 144 times in the last 12 months .
the council said it did not consider the use to be directed at members of the public , but against traders it had suspected of crime .
' petty and vindictive ' simon davies , director of campaign group privacy international , called for a review of ripa .
" ripa put physical surveillance on a legal basis but that does n't make it right or morally right - it just covers the back of local authorities , but at huge expense , " mr davies said .
there are strict rules to protect people from unnecessary intrusion sir simon milton local government authority " local authorities can be very petty and vindictive and they can become obsessed with issues like dog fouling and there can be a lack of judgment .
" in the case of dog fouling it 's almost morally justifiable to bring these people to book , but you have to ask the question is the response an overkill ?
" there are better ways to achieve the objectives without using counter-terrorism laws . "
shami chakrabarti , director of human rights group liberty , said : " you do n't use a sledgehammer to crack a nut , nor targeted surveillance to stop a litter bug .
" you can care about serious crime and terrorism without throwing away our personal privacy with a snoopers ' charter .
" the law must be reformed to require sign-off by judges not self authorisation by over-zealous bureaucrats . "
sir simon milton , local government association chairman , said councils were using the law to protect people against rip-off merchants , fly-tippers and benefit fraudsters .
" it 's wrong to suggest that these are specifically anti-terror powers , " he said .
" there are strict rules to protect people from unnecessary intrusion , and whenever a council applies to use these powers they must prove that it is both necessary and proportionate to the crime being investigated . "
out of the 97 councils contacted , 16 said they did not use the act at all , 19 asked for the request to be submitted under the freedom of information act and 16 did not respond .

earlier this month it emerged that poole borough council in dorset used ripa to spy on a family for three weeks to find out if they were really living in a school catchment area .
the council said the case was treated as potential criminal activity , which justified the use of the act .

some local authorities have used the regulation of investigatory powers act -lrb- ripa -rrb- more than 100 times in the last 12 months to conduct surveillance .
the findings , obtained by the press association news agency , come from 46 of the 468 local authorities in the uk .
privacy campaigners called for a " root and branch review " of the law .
earlier this month it emerged that poole borough council in dorset used ripa to spy on a family for three weeks to find out if they were really living in a school catchment area .
the council said the case was treated as potential criminal activity , which justified the use of the act .
less serious offences home office guidance says ripa allows " the interception of communications , carrying out of surveillance and the use of covert human intelligence sources " to help prevent crime , including terrorism .
the press association contacted 97 councils to find out how they were using the powers .
the 46 who responded said they had used the act a total of 1,343 times , mainly against rogue trading , benefit fraud and anti-social behaviour like criminal damage .
but some said the law was also used to find out about other less serious offences , such as : derby city council , bolton , gateshead and hartlepool used surveillance to investigate dog fouling .
bolton council also used the act to investigate littering .
the london borough of kensington and chelsea conducted surveillance on the misuse of a disabled parking badge .
liverpool city council used ripa to identify a false claim for damages .
conwy council used the law to spy on a person who was working while off sick .
the survey found the biggest user of ripa was durham county council , which used it 144 times in the last 12 months .
the council said it did not consider the use to be directed at members of the public , but against traders it had suspected of crime .
' petty and vindictive ' simon davies , director of campaign group privacy international , called for a review of ripa .
" ripa put physical surveillance on a legal basis but that does n't make it right or morally right - it just covers the back of local authorities , but at huge expense , " mr davies said .
there are strict rules to protect people from unnecessary intrusion sir simon milton local government authority " local authorities can be very petty and vindictive and they can become obsessed with issues like dog fouling and there can be a lack of judgment .
" in the case of dog fouling it 's almost morally justifiable to bring these people to book , but you have to ask the question is the response an overkill ?
" there are better ways to achieve the objectives without using counter-terrorism laws . "
shami chakrabarti , director of human rights group liberty , said : " you do n't use a sledgehammer to crack a nut , nor targeted surveillance to stop a litter bug .
" you can care about serious crime and terrorism without throwing away our personal privacy with a snoopers ' charter .
" the law must be reformed to require sign-off by judges not self authorisation by over-zealous bureaucrats . "
sir simon milton , local government association chairman , said councils were using the law to protect people against rip-off merchants , fly-tippers and benefit fraudsters .
" it 's wrong to suggest that these are specifically anti-terror powers , " he said .
" there are strict rules to protect people from unnecessary intrusion , and whenever a council applies to use these powers they must prove that it is both necessary and proportionate to the crime being investigated . "
out of the 97 councils contacted , 16 said they did not use the act at all , 19 asked for the request to be submitted under the freedom of information act and 16 did not respond .
