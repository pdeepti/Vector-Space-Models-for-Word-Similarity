the eu-brokered cease-fire left moscow with too much leeway , he said . scheffer blamed oversights in an eu-brokered peace deal for not demanding the full withdrawal of troops to their bases in russia before the war with georgia last month . the nato secretary-general made the comments in an interview with the financial times shortly before he travelled to tbilisi on monday , sept .

" the option of keeping russian forces in south ossetia and abkhazia is not acceptable . " scheffer later on monday denied portions of the report in which he was critical of the georgia peace deal , saying he had only raised concerns about russia 's implementation of it . " the secretary-general remains fully supportive of the agreement negotiated by president sarkozy , " nato spokesman james appathurai said , according to the afp news agency .

" of course i 've heard the declarations he makes , declarations that are inappropriate for the leader of such a serious organization , " he was quoted by interfax news agency as saying . russia 's top diplomat on monday was due in the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali , where the fighting erupted on aug .

15 , the bloc 's priority was to deploy 200 observers in georgia before oct . 1 , in compliance with a ceasefire brokered by french president nicolas sarkozy earlier this month . " after that , we will see how the situation evolves , " solana said ahead of talks with eu foreign ministers in brussels .
on sunday , russia completed the withdrawal of its troops from western georgia , including the strategically important black sea port of poti , in accordance with the eu ceasefire deal .
the agreement reached on sept .
8 states that the eu must have at least 200 observers in georgia by oct .
1 if russia is to withdraw its troops from the buffer zones that it has since created .
" the withdrawal is a process , and we are glad that it has started , " said eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
diplomats say that 11 countries - the baltic states , belgium , britain , france , germany , italy , poland , spain and sweden - have already pledged support for the eu mission .
" we are very committed to making sure that we play our full part in that important mission , meeting the deadline and getting the right number of people in at the right time to the right places , " british foreign minister david miliband said .
russia against eu observers in breakaway regions the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is already mandated to post observers in south ossetia , and talks are under way to boost their number by another 80 , said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who currently holds the osce 's rotating presidency .
" we have a mandate to go into south ossetia for 80 people .
what the final outcome of the 80 will be we do n't know , that 's what the georgians and russians are discussing and i think it 's a very positive development because they 're sitting together around the table , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia resists the idea of eu observers in the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia russia has so far rejected any suggestion that the eu should send its own observers into the breakaway regions , leaving the eu 's foreign ministers walking a tight-rope as they draw up the mission 's mandate .
" we need the agreement of all sides involved , because we do not want to act as an occupying force , " italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
some member states are pushing for a specific reference to the breakaway regions , while others argue that the wording should be left ambiguous to avoid antagonizing moscow , diplomats said ahead of the meeting .
" we are ready and disposed to go beyond the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- commitments into other places , but we have to see how the situation evolves on the ground , " solana said monday .
brussles pledges more aid to georgia separately , benita ferrero-waldner said on monday the eu commission is ready to provide " up to 500 million euros " -lrb- $ 714 million -rrb- in additional aid to georgia to help rebuild its infrastructure after the war with russia .
the additional money comes on top of the roughly 100 million euros already being planned for georgia this year , and it will add to any bilateral aid being provided by the eu 's individual member states .
the money would be spread over the 2008-2010 period and would be used in four major areas : refugees and internally displaced people , economic recovery , financial stabilization and infrastructure .

the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 15.09.2008 after lehman , expert calls for framework on bank bailouts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax plunged after lehman filed for bankruptcy on monday us banking giant lehman brothers is filing for bankruptcy , the latest us lender to bow to the pressures of the subprime mortgage crisis .
more losses are likely , a german economist told dw . dr. michael schroeder is the head of the department of international finance and financial management at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , a non-profit economic research institute in mannheim , germany . deutsche welle : dr. schroeder , how will lehman 's collapse affect europe ? michael schroeder : that question is difficult to answer .
lehman does n't have much systemic risk , or risk with a high probability that it will pull down other banks in its wake .
so i do n't expect the direct counterparts in the banking sector will be hit very strongly . but it is a signal that much greater-than-expected problems in the banking sector are yet to come .
some experts thought one or two months ago that the worse of the subprime crisis was over .
but as we see in the news , this is not the case .
it was very optimistic . world stock markets dropped sharply at the lehman bankruptcy news .
why does the failure of one us bank have such far-reaching financial effects ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says more problems are yet to come i think it has to do with the fact that there still very high losses to come in the near future .
we see that hedge funds , or so-called monoline insurance companies , or other banking institutions could go bankrupt or near-bankrupt by the end of the year - particularly in the us but also perhaps in europe , due to collateral damage in the sector . the expectations are now that high losses could come in the next two or three months .
this will also hurt the business cycle in europe .
but it is difficult to predict to how great an extent ; how strong the impact will be . should consumers in germany be concerned ? well , yes , german consumers should be concerned because the business cycle will be relatively weak over the next year .
but the consumers themselves are part of the problem .
the economy gets weaker , they become more risk averse , then they consume less , and it drives the cycle downwards . ...
germans should consumer more , to combat this cycle . the us government opted not to bail out lehman .
yet the german government recently went to the aid of the ikb bank , when that lender nearly collapsed in the wake of the subprime crisis ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billions of euros were spent bailing out the ikb bank i think bailing out banks or companies has a lot to do with so-called systemic risks .
i do not expect that lehman really will have a strong effect on other banks or banking systems … so the us was right for not bailing out lehman brothers , in my opinion . i also did n't understand why the german government bailed out ikb .
in my opinion it was absolutely unnecessary , and it imposes relatively high costs to the taxpayers in germany . one us analyst is comparing this monday to a certain black monday back in 1929 .
is that realistic ? that is absolutely exaggerated ...
i do n't believe we have an unmanageable , or even an extremely strong , crisis right now .
the stock markets and all the other markets have reacted realistically . there are , of course , very high losses .
but it is not a catastrophe . is there a lesson to draw from this turn of events ? we need a new framework for the banking industry that should be instituted when this crisis is over .
we need clear rules that say when to bail out and when not to bail out a company . politicians should make it clear that banks can go bankrupt . ...
there are many medium size banks that should be allowed to go bankrupt when they have no liquidity anymore . we also need to have a framework for how it should be handled when a bank is bailed out .
managers should n't be allowed to get away with being extremely risk-loving and then not have to pay the price if that strategy fails . when the economy absorbs losses it should be clear who has to pay for these losses .

the carrier , which has a well-developed air network in africa , allows lufthansa to offer its passengers an additional 12 destinations . the german carrier has said it envisions brussels airlines continuing to operate largely independently after the deal . the two airlines , which enjoy an excellent reputation internationally , could complement each other 's offers and allow both to expand their routes , lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber said . for lufthansa , the takeover of brussels airlines marks a further step in the german carrier 's expansion plans . rising fuel prices and a global financial slowdown has hit airlines hard , sparking a wave of mergers and shaking up the aviation market .
three years ago , lufthansa bought the ailing swiss carrier , swiss for around 310 million euros .
today , swiss is worth several billion euros . lufthansa allegedly eyeing sas , austrian lufthansa reportedly is also eyeing scandinavian rival , sas in a bid to catch up with its competitor , air france-klm which remains europe 's largest airline . lufthansa , which expects operating profits of 1.4 billion euros in the current year , will have no problems buying sas , which last week was worth around 830 million euros on the stock exchange . the timing for a takeover of sas could not be better either - last year , sas shares plunged by over 60 percent before partially recovering in the last three months . lufthansa is also considered a potential buyer for austrian airlines .
the austrian carrier expects losses of around 70 million euros this year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crisis underscores how banks have squandered their most prized asset - trust - says dw 's karl zawadzky . trust is the beginning of everything .
and now , mistrust is the end of everything .
this was illustrated dramatically by events on wall street on monday .
trust in the stability of large american banks has evaporated , and mistrust now reigns on wall street as well as in financial districts in london , frankfurt and tokyo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking crisis has now claimed lehman brothers , america 's fourth-largest investment bank .
the institute was founded 158 years ago by german immigrants and recently has posted billion-strong losses quarter after quarter .
in the second quarter of this year , the institution registered a record loss of $ 4 million .
the frantic search for a new cash injection turned out to be in vain . on sunday night , the bank 's management had no choice but to file for chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy filing ever .
that has won the bank a little time to find fresh funds or perhaps to be taken under the wings of another large bank . if that does n't work out , liquidation of a once strong and proud bank is certain .
america 's third-largest investment bank , merrill lynch , has found a savior for now with the bank of america taking over the stricken institution . the shockwaves from reeling us financial markets has pushed global share markets into the red .
there remains no doubt that the international banking crisis has reached a new danger level .
the us government and the federal reserve are no longer prepared to take responsibility for the mistakes of private banks . six months ago , they facilitated the emergency sale of the comparatively small investment bank bear stearns to the financial institution j.p. morgan chase with a massive loan .
they also bailed out mortgage banks fannie mae and freddie mac with the staggering sum of $ 5 trillion .
but now apparently it 's the end of state bailouts or maybe the american state has reached the limits of its financial largesse .
after all , this is about a lot of money . lehman brothers has debts worth $ 613 billion .
of course , the government and the federal reserve will try to avoid a domino effect .
but first it 's up to the private financial sector to step in - not with words but with money .
ten leading international banks , including germany 's deutsche bank , are pooling in $ 70 billion in a fund to help each other with possible cash crunches . lehman brothers , a renowned traditional bank , is in a tailspin .
without a large investor - with really deep pockets - the end of the bank is nigh .
the bank first squandered away its billions and then fell victim to the raging mistrust in financial markets . lehman is n't the first bank to suffer this fate and probably wo n't be the last .
the current banking crisis is the result of too much cheap federal reserve money , endless greed and overly generous banking supervision .
that explains the mistakes and extremes rife in the current financial disaster . germany is also affected by it .
german banks have irresponsibly speculated with bad american mortgages .
but in america , the crisis has a whole new dimension .
the result is n't just a financial disaster but also a political scandal . after the profits have been privatized , the losses are now being nationalized .
even if governments and federal reserves do n't stand by threatened banks , the banking crisis emanating from the us has squeezed the world economy . everybody is paying a price for the wrong acts of some .
in this context , calls for a stronger regulation of the financial sector are understandable .
banks have simply squandered trust .
but let 's not forget that it 's not money but rather the trust of investors and customers that is the most prized asset of banks .
that asset has been severely abused . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crisis underscores how banks have squandered their most prized asset - trust - says dw 's karl zawadzky . trust is the beginning of everything .

this was illustrated dramatically by events on wall street on monday .

the frantic search for a new cash injection turned out to be in vain . on sunday night , the bank 's management had no choice but to file for chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy filing ever .

america 's third-largest investment bank , merrill lynch , has found a savior for now with the bank of america taking over the stricken institution . the shockwaves from reeling us financial markets has pushed global share markets into the red .

"
the eu-brokered cease-fire left moscow with too much leeway , he said . scheffer blamed oversights in an eu-brokered peace deal for not demanding the full withdrawal of troops to their bases in russia before the war with georgia last month . the nato secretary-general made the comments in an interview with the financial times shortly before he travelled to tbilisi on monday , sept .
15 , in a show of support for georgia 's nato membership ambitions . " if the russians are staying in south ossetia with so many forces , i do not consider this as a return to the status quo , " scheffer told the british newspaper .
" the option of keeping russian forces in south ossetia and abkhazia is not acceptable . " scheffer later on monday denied portions of the report in which he was critical of the georgia peace deal , saying he had only raised concerns about russia 's implementation of it . " the secretary-general remains fully supportive of the agreement negotiated by president sarkozy , " nato spokesman james appathurai said , according to the afp news agency .
" he has , however , expressed reservations about russia 's implementation of the six-point plan , in particular with regard to their returning to pre-aug .
7 positions . " he has never criticised the eu and certainly not on this agreement , " appathurai added . a day after signing last week 's peace accord , moscow said near 8,000 troops would stay in the separatist regions , where considerably fewer of its peacekeepers patrolled under a un mandate before the conflict . nato showing support for georgia the object of the two-day georgia trip by ambassadors from the 26 nato member states will be ongoing talks - insistently backed by the united states - on extending georgia membership in the alliance . despite the urgency now surrounding georgia 's accession talks in the wake of the conflict with russia , nato members are far from decided on further expansion into the former soviet territory . western europe - germany , france , spain and italy - beg to delay inviting georgia and ukraine under its security umbrella , fearing a nightmare scenario in which alliance troops could face off with russian forces in eastern europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer russia and nato froze relations last month , and scheffer , who has been particularly critical of the kremlin over the conflict , said " a speedy revival of the nato-russia council will not be easy . " at the same time , russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov was wrapping up a tour of georgia 's separatist region of abkhazia and south ossetia , underscoring the rift with the west since russia recognized both provinces ' claims to independence . lavrov slammed scheffer 's politics , speaking in the abkhaz capital of sukhumi on sunday . " of course i 've heard the declarations he makes , declarations that are inappropriate for the leader of such a serious organization , " he was quoted by interfax news agency as saying . russia 's top diplomat on monday was due in the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali , where the fighting erupted on aug .
8 . peace accord leaves many in eu unsettled in brussels , the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana affirmed the european union was ready to replace russian troops in georgia with its own civilian observers within the next two weeks . but many in europe have been feeling burned by the rushed peace deal negotiated by french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the eu rotating presidency . vagueness in the accord has allowed moscow to say it provides only for the 200-strong eu mission to deploy in " buffer zones , " effectively giving the eu observers a role of safeguarding the boundaries of georgia 's separatists . those regions are part of georgian territory , the eu has said , but an agreement to tackle the status of the regions in peace talks was also dropped by moscow in the latest pact that provides for peace talks in geneva next month . some russian forces had pulled out from positions deep inside georgia at its black sea port of poti over the weekend in accord with monday 's deadline for the first phase of a withdrawal . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .
similar impatience in the working and middle classes amid perceptions that they are slipping back has emerged in britain .
rallies for " fair " pay the labour government 's determination to restrain pay for public-sector workers will be challenged this autumn by teachers and civil servants , who say they are no longer prepared to live on wages eaten up by rising costs for food and fuel .
so far , prime minister gordon brown has argued that low wage demands over the past few years have contributed to economic growth and stability , low unemployment and a rise in living standards .
but after biting the bullet for most of the last 11 years of labour rule , and facing additional challenges from the global economic downturn and the credit crunch , the trade unions are no longer prepared to toe the line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are split on whether higher wages will lead to a wage-price spiral the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- voted this month for " days of action " this autumn in support of higher wages .
rather than strikes , there will be rallies and street protests for " fair pay . "
the tuc could no longer tolerate a sharp drop in living standards for members while the pay packets of bosses were going up by 20 or 30 percent , tuc secretary-general brendan barber said .
warning against pay hikes norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , said in an interview that the danger from pay hikes was real .
if pay were to rise sharply , " the outcome will be inflationary effects in the short term and probably a weakening in growth . "
" pay negotiators do not seem to realize that the terms of trade for nations that import energy and food have worsened , " he said .
declining terms of trade mean that a nation 's imports become more expensive in comparison to its exports .
walter said the ecb would not have had to keep its interest rates so high " if we had intelligent players " who understood that big picture .
earn more , spend more the opposing view comes from claus schaefer , an economist at germany 's trade-union think-tank wsi in dusseldorf , who studies how germans share their economic cake .
it was precisely because the world economy was weak that germans needed to earn more and spend more .
" domestic demand can ease the effects of an economic slowing and make a stabilizing contribution during the slowdown phase , " he said in an interview .
" in germany and in other eu nations we have had a very restrained incomes policy .
profits have risen sharply , but wages have stagnated in nominal terms and actually fallen in real terms , " schaefer said .
current pay claims were " a small correction to past inequalities . "
he dismissed fears of a wage-price spiral , which he said had only been seen in post-war germany in the late 1960s and the early 1980s .
deutsche bank 's walter disagreed , saying that boosting domestic demand in times of trouble is only helpful in low-debt economies .
but germany had high public debt and was struggling to provide for an ageing society .
" we have already eaten up our future at breakfast time , " he said .
inflation fears rise in eastern europe in eastern european nations , where the post-1989 change from communism to private enterprise has brought prosperity to many , fears have also been growing among labor groups that inflation will eat up the gains .
tough labor talks are expected in the czech republic this autumn as public and private-sector unions seek an 8-percent pay rise for 2009 .
the czech chamber of commerce called the demand unrealistic .
koruna inflation cut real wage growth to 1.1 percent in the second quarter of 2008 , the lowest in 10 years .
a recent study found poles were earning more and have better job security , but the benefits of a stronger zloty have not helped all .
the solidarity union recently brought out at least 18,000 marchers for poland 's largest labor protest in years .
organizers displayed shopping carts with a few basic staples , saying the items were all a minimum-wage worker or retiree could afford .
labor rumblings have also been growing in the baltic nations as their years of boom fade .

metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .
similar impatience in the working and middle classes amid perceptions that they are slipping back has emerged in britain .
rallies for " fair " pay the labour government 's determination to restrain pay for public-sector workers will be challenged this autumn by teachers and civil servants , who say they are no longer prepared to live on wages eaten up by rising costs for food and fuel .
so far , prime minister gordon brown has argued that low wage demands over the past few years have contributed to economic growth and stability , low unemployment and a rise in living standards .
but after biting the bullet for most of the last 11 years of labour rule , and facing additional challenges from the global economic downturn and the credit crunch , the trade unions are no longer prepared to toe the line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are split on whether higher wages will lead to a wage-price spiral the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- voted this month for " days of action " this autumn in support of higher wages .
rather than strikes , there will be rallies and street protests for " fair pay . "
the tuc could no longer tolerate a sharp drop in living standards for members while the pay packets of bosses were going up by 20 or 30 percent , tuc secretary-general brendan barber said .
warning against pay hikes norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , said in an interview that the danger from pay hikes was real .
if pay were to rise sharply , " the outcome will be inflationary effects in the short term and probably a weakening in growth . "
" pay negotiators do not seem to realize that the terms of trade for nations that import energy and food have worsened , " he said .
declining terms of trade mean that a nation 's imports become more expensive in comparison to its exports .
walter said the ecb would not have had to keep its interest rates so high " if we had intelligent players " who understood that big picture .
earn more , spend more the opposing view comes from claus schaefer , an economist at germany 's trade-union think-tank wsi in dusseldorf , who studies how germans share their economic cake .
it was precisely because the world economy was weak that germans needed to earn more and spend more .
" domestic demand can ease the effects of an economic slowing and make a stabilizing contribution during the slowdown phase , " he said in an interview .
" in germany and in other eu nations we have had a very restrained incomes policy .
profits have risen sharply , but wages have stagnated in nominal terms and actually fallen in real terms , " schaefer said .
current pay claims were " a small correction to past inequalities . "
he dismissed fears of a wage-price spiral , which he said had only been seen in post-war germany in the late 1960s and the early 1980s .
deutsche bank 's walter disagreed , saying that boosting domestic demand in times of trouble is only helpful in low-debt economies .
but germany had high public debt and was struggling to provide for an ageing society .
" we have already eaten up our future at breakfast time , " he said .
inflation fears rise in eastern europe in eastern european nations , where the post-1989 change from communism to private enterprise has brought prosperity to many , fears have also been growing among labor groups that inflation will eat up the gains .
tough labor talks are expected in the czech republic this autumn as public and private-sector unions seek an 8-percent pay rise for 2009 .
the czech chamber of commerce called the demand unrealistic .

metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .
similar impatience in the working and middle classes amid perceptions that they are slipping back has emerged in britain .
rallies for " fair " pay the labour government 's determination to restrain pay for public-sector workers will be challenged this autumn by teachers and civil servants , who say they are no longer prepared to live on wages eaten up by rising costs for food and fuel .
so far , prime minister gordon brown has argued that low wage demands over the past few years have contributed to economic growth and stability , low unemployment and a rise in living standards .
but after biting the bullet for most of the last 11 years of labour rule , and facing additional challenges from the global economic downturn and the credit crunch , the trade unions are no longer prepared to toe the line .

metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .
similar impatience in the working and middle classes amid perceptions that they are slipping back has emerged in britain .
rallies for " fair " pay the labour government 's determination to restrain pay for public-sector workers will be challenged this autumn by teachers and civil servants , who say they are no longer prepared to live on wages eaten up by rising costs for food and fuel .
so far , prime minister gordon brown has argued that low wage demands over the past few years have contributed to economic growth and stability , low unemployment and a rise in living standards .
but after biting the bullet for most of the last 11 years of labour rule , and facing additional challenges from the global economic downturn and the credit crunch , the trade unions are no longer prepared to toe the line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are split on whether higher wages will lead to a wage-price spiral the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- voted this month for " days of action " this autumn in support of higher wages .
rather than strikes , there will be rallies and street protests for " fair pay . "
the tuc could no longer tolerate a sharp drop in living standards for members while the pay packets of bosses were going up by 20 or 30 percent , tuc secretary-general brendan barber said .
warning against pay hikes norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , said in an interview that the danger from pay hikes was real .
if pay were to rise sharply , " the outcome will be inflationary effects in the short term and probably a weakening in growth . "
" pay negotiators do not seem to realize that the terms of trade for nations that import energy and food have worsened , " he said .
declining terms of trade mean that a nation 's imports become more expensive in comparison to its exports .
walter said the ecb would not have had to keep its interest rates so high " if we had intelligent players " who understood that big picture .
earn more , spend more the opposing view comes from claus schaefer , an economist at germany 's trade-union think-tank wsi in dusseldorf , who studies how germans share their economic cake .
it was precisely because the world economy was weak that germans needed to earn more and spend more .
" domestic demand can ease the effects of an economic slowing and make a stabilizing contribution during the slowdown phase , " he said in an interview .
" in germany and in other eu nations we have had a very restrained incomes policy .
profits have risen sharply , but wages have stagnated in nominal terms and actually fallen in real terms , " schaefer said .
current pay claims were " a small correction to past inequalities . "
he dismissed fears of a wage-price spiral , which he said had only been seen in post-war germany in the late 1960s and the early 1980s .
deutsche bank 's walter disagreed , saying that boosting domestic demand in times of trouble is only helpful in low-debt economies .
but germany had high public debt and was struggling to provide for an ageing society .
" we have already eaten up our future at breakfast time , " he said .
inflation fears rise in eastern europe in eastern european nations , where the post-1989 change from communism to private enterprise has brought prosperity to many , fears have also been growing among labor groups that inflation will eat up the gains .
tough labor talks are expected in the czech republic this autumn as public and private-sector unions seek an 8-percent pay rise for 2009 .
the czech chamber of commerce called the demand unrealistic .
koruna inflation cut real wage growth to 1.1 percent in the second quarter of 2008 , the lowest in 10 years .
a recent study found poles were earning more and have better job security , but the benefits of a stronger zloty have not helped all .
the solidarity union recently brought out at least 18,000 marchers for poland 's largest labor protest in years .
organizers displayed shopping carts with a few basic staples , saying the items were all a minimum-wage worker or retiree could afford .
labor rumblings have also been growing in the baltic nations as their years of boom fade .
latvia 's government has said it will freeze public-sector wages in 2009 , prompting union threats of labor action and calls for the government to resign . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports energy -pipe- 15.09.2008 science edges towards a new generation of biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to biofuels such as ethanol from sugar cane could still help support economies dw-world.de talked to prof. eva-mari aro , an expert on plant physiology and molecular biology at the university of turku in finland , about the current developments in the pursuit of new biofuel technologies . dw-world.de : what are the most viable alternatives to biofuels like ethanol and how do they work ? eva-mari aro : new generation biofuels can be roughly divided into two groups : fuels , which use biomass as a raw material and systems where living organisms -lrb- or biomimicing devices -rrb- produce some liquid fuel , hydrogen or other gas directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide . biomass based biofuels are already close to real application and their breakthrough is mostly dependent on oil price .
however , accumulation of biomass is thermodynamically inefficient process and the conversion of biomass into the form liquid fuel decreases the efficiency more .
biomass has very low efficiency to store energy from sunlight and even in ideal situation they can replace only some percents from fossil fuels .
anyway , they are considered to be a good business when oil prise increases enough . biomass independent systems , in contrast , have very high efficacy in theory , and have real potential to replace fossil fuels .
however , there are still unsolved technical barriers against the real breakthrough of biomass free systems . nowadays ethanol and biodiesel are produced from the same raw materials than food .
this is very inefficient and ethically daunting way for fuel production .
in order to make system more sustainable , the first step is to replace food-based raw materials by more efficient and ethical feedstock .
practically this means organic waste falls , forests and special bioenergy crops and algae . considerable number of research and development is going on in this field .
the idea behind is to convert the biomass into the form of biofuel .
most of the resources are in development of physical , chemical and biochemical processes that can be used to produce biofuels from whatever bulk biomass .
other important area is to explore and develop new plants , which are more suitable for biofuel production as compared to the traditional food crops . agro , forest and oil industry is already involved in developing these systems and they no doubt believe that this will be a business .
indeed , the conversion of bulk biomass into liquid fuels can strongly increase the biofuel production .
however , to be honest , biomass never can replace oil , unless the energy consumption on human population will drop to a fraction of the present one , which will not happen without nuclear war-like catastrophe . the fundamental problem of biomass is that plants store the energy from sunlight into their biomass very inefficiently .
plants are not evolved to be the feedstock of energy production for human activities .
in order to make accumulation of biomass more efficient plants must be pushed to store solar energy many times more efficiently than they do in the nature .
however , plants are so complicated organisms that most probably this will be a mission impossible . as compared to real plants , unicellular algae are simpler and easier to manipulate .
only one type of cell does the all tasks from harvesting the light energy to storage of the energy and for reproduction .
moreover , algae can grow in seawater , which is a great advance when compared to plants . under certain conditions algae can double the biomass in one day and large share of this biomass can be starch or oil , which are easy and energy efficient to convert into form of alcohol or biodiesel .
this means that algae can be much more efficient feedstock for biomass based biofuels than higher plants , particularly for biodiesel formation . the most promising feature of algae is , however , that they can produce molecular hydrogen directly from sunlight and water .
in the nature , this pathway is a kind of emergency valve and function only under very specific conditions .
as such , it has very minor capacity in natural algae .
the existence of this pathway , however , gives a great opportunity to bioscientists to use metabolic engineering in order to make hydrogen production very efficient . what are the benefits of these alternatives ? the main benefit is that there is no competition with food supply .
these alternatives are also very efficient .
in theory , solarbiohydrogen can be a real option for fossil fuels . what effect would the production of these alternatives have on the current production processes of biofuels -lrb- e.g. use of agricultural land , economies in places like brazil , the environment , the alleged contribution to the current food crisis -rrb- ? in general , sunlight is the driving force of the all new systems .
because algae can grow in salt water , the needed water can be pumped from the seas .
when the microalgal solarbiohydrogen systems will be fully developed , indeed , the limiting factor for hydrogen production will be size of bioreactors and availability of solar energy for algal photosynthesis . in present world , there is nearly absolute negative correlation between gdp and high mean daily irradiance .
in the future , when the sunlight will be the main energy source for the need of human beings , the today 's poorest countries will have something that rich countries really are craving .
this means for sure , that new energy business will colonize these poor but very sunny countries in africa and asia . there is no real democracy in these countries , and because of this , there is a risk that the money will flow to the rulers and solar energy money will spread the " middle east " all over central and north africa .
however , if western governments and public organizations monitor the technology transfer , the new energy technology will be a great opportunity to the developing countries . the basic idea of new generation biofuels is not to compete with resources needed to food production .
if in the future the sunny poor countries will be real players in global energy market , it means resources for them .
technology transfer must be linked to the requirements providing that the benefits will be used to modernize the whole society starting from agriculture . would the eu be interested in adopting fuels made from these alternatives or are they focused on ethanol and others ? eu has already a roadmap for a hydrogen economy .
ethanol is not the best solution and the eu knows this .
biodiesel from microalgae is a very attractive option for the eu as well . how easy or hard would it be to produce these alternatives and introduce them into industry and society ? biomass based systems are quite easy .
basically we have the technology , but low energy prices hinder the scaling up of the pilot scale plants .
when the oil price reaches a certain threshold , these technologies will take their part in the energy market . solarbiohydrogen , artificial photosynthesis and other these kinds of more advanced systems are still under development and some fundamental questions need to be solved before commercialisation .
however , the concept is clear and there should n't be anything in this respect that is not possible to solve . what is needed to make the system run is money and smart people .
if industry starts to finance the projects , investments must be a part of their long-term business strategy .
society has to accept genetic manipulation .
in advanced bioenergy field we ca n't do anything without all the tools of modern biotechnology .
anti genetically modified organism -lrb- gmo -rrb- people really should think what the price of banning gmos would be . in general , when massive amounts of hydrogen flow out from bioreactors , everything after that will go fluently .
the transfer from an oil economy to a hydrogen economy is just a set of political decisions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moreover , algae can grow in seawater , which is a great advance when compared to plants . under certain conditions algae can double the biomass in one day and large share of this biomass can be starch or oil , which are easy and energy efficient to convert into form of alcohol or biodiesel .
this means that algae can be much more efficient feedstock for biomass based biofuels than higher plants , particularly for biodiesel formation . the most promising feature of algae is , however , that they can produce molecular hydrogen directly from sunlight and water .
in the nature , this pathway is a kind of emergency valve and function only under very specific conditions .
as such , it has very minor capacity in natural algae .
the existence of this pathway , however , gives a great opportunity to bioscientists to use metabolic engineering in order to make hydrogen production very efficient . what are the benefits of these alternatives ? the main benefit is that there is no competition with food supply .
these alternatives are also very efficient .
in theory , solarbiohydrogen can be a real option for fossil fuels . what effect would the production of these alternatives have on the current production processes of biofuels -lrb- e.g. use of agricultural land , economies in places like brazil , the environment , the alleged contribution to the current food crisis -rrb- ? in general , sunlight is the driving force of the all new systems .
because algae can grow in salt water , the needed water can be pumped from the seas .
when the microalgal solarbiohydrogen systems will be fully developed , indeed , the limiting factor for hydrogen production will be size of bioreactors and availability of solar energy for algal photosynthesis . in present world , there is nearly absolute negative correlation between gdp and high mean daily irradiance .
in the future , when the sunlight will be the main energy source for the need of human beings , the today 's poorest countries will have something that rich countries really are craving .
this means for sure , that new energy business will colonize these poor but very sunny countries in africa and asia . there is no real democracy in these countries , and because of this , there is a risk that the money will flow to the rulers and solar energy money will spread the " middle east " all over central and north africa .
however , if western governments and public organizations monitor the technology transfer , the new energy technology will be a great opportunity to the developing countries . the basic idea of new generation biofuels is not to compete with resources needed to food production .
if in the future the sunny poor countries will be real players in global energy market , it means resources for them .
technology transfer must be linked to the requirements providing that the benefits will be used to modernize the whole society starting from agriculture . would the eu be interested in adopting fuels made from these alternatives or are they focused on ethanol and others ? eu has already a roadmap for a hydrogen economy .
ethanol is not the best solution and the eu knows this .
biodiesel from microalgae is a very attractive option for the eu as well . how easy or hard would it be to produce these alternatives and introduce them into industry and society ? biomass based systems are quite easy .
basically we have the technology , but low energy prices hinder the scaling up of the pilot scale plants .
when the oil price reaches a certain threshold , these technologies will take their part in the energy market . solarbiohydrogen , artificial photosynthesis and other these kinds of more advanced systems are still under development and some fundamental questions need to be solved before commercialisation .
however , the concept is clear and there should n't be anything in this respect that is not possible to solve . what is needed to make the system run is money and smart people .
if industry starts to finance the projects , investments must be a part of their long-term business strategy .
society has to accept genetic manipulation .
in advanced bioenergy field we ca n't do anything without all the tools of modern biotechnology .
anti genetically modified organism -lrb- gmo -rrb- people really should think what the price of banning gmos would be . in general , when massive amounts of hydrogen flow out from bioreactors , everything after that will go fluently .

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports energy -pipe- 15.09.2008 science edges towards a new generation of biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to biofuels such as ethanol from sugar cane could still help support economies dw-world.de talked to prof. eva-mari aro , an expert on plant physiology and molecular biology at the university of turku in finland , about the current developments in the pursuit of new biofuel technologies . dw-world.de : what are the most viable alternatives to biofuels like ethanol and how do they work ? eva-mari aro : new generation biofuels can be roughly divided into two groups : fuels , which use biomass as a raw material and systems where living organisms -lrb- or biomimicing devices -rrb- produce some liquid fuel , hydrogen or other gas directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide . biomass based biofuels are already close to real application and their breakthrough is mostly dependent on oil price .
however , accumulation of biomass is thermodynamically inefficient process and the conversion of biomass into the form liquid fuel decreases the efficiency more .
biomass has very low efficiency to store energy from sunlight and even in ideal situation they can replace only some percents from fossil fuels .
anyway , they are considered to be a good business when oil prise increases enough . biomass independent systems , in contrast , have very high efficacy in theory , and have real potential to replace fossil fuels .
however , there are still unsolved technical barriers against the real breakthrough of biomass free systems . nowadays ethanol and biodiesel are produced from the same raw materials than food .
this is very inefficient and ethically daunting way for fuel production .
in order to make system more sustainable , the first step is to replace food-based raw materials by more efficient and ethical feedstock .
practically this means organic waste falls , forests and special bioenergy crops and algae . considerable number of research and development is going on in this field .
the idea behind is to convert the biomass into the form of biofuel .
most of the resources are in development of physical , chemical and biochemical processes that can be used to produce biofuels from whatever bulk biomass .
other important area is to explore and develop new plants , which are more suitable for biofuel production as compared to the traditional food crops . agro , forest and oil industry is already involved in developing these systems and they no doubt believe that this will be a business .
indeed , the conversion of bulk biomass into liquid fuels can strongly increase the biofuel production .
however , to be honest , biomass never can replace oil , unless the energy consumption on human population will drop to a fraction of the present one , which will not happen without nuclear war-like catastrophe . the fundamental problem of biomass is that plants store the energy from sunlight into their biomass very inefficiently .
plants are not evolved to be the feedstock of energy production for human activities .
in order to make accumulation of biomass more efficient plants must be pushed to store solar energy many times more efficiently than they do in the nature .
however , plants are so complicated organisms that most probably this will be a mission impossible . as compared to real plants , unicellular algae are simpler and easier to manipulate .

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports energy -pipe- 15.09.2008 science edges towards a new generation of biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to biofuels such as ethanol from sugar cane could still help support economies dw-world.de talked to prof. eva-mari aro , an expert on plant physiology and molecular biology at the university of turku in finland , about the current developments in the pursuit of new biofuel technologies . dw-world.de : what are the most viable alternatives to biofuels like ethanol and how do they work ? eva-mari aro : new generation biofuels can be roughly divided into two groups : fuels , which use biomass as a raw material and systems where living organisms -lrb- or biomimicing devices -rrb- produce some liquid fuel , hydrogen or other gas directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide . biomass based biofuels are already close to real application and their breakthrough is mostly dependent on oil price .
however , accumulation of biomass is thermodynamically inefficient process and the conversion of biomass into the form liquid fuel decreases the efficiency more .
biomass has very low efficiency to store energy from sunlight and even in ideal situation they can replace only some percents from fossil fuels .
anyway , they are considered to be a good business when oil prise increases enough . biomass independent systems , in contrast , have very high efficacy in theory , and have real potential to replace fossil fuels .
however , there are still unsolved technical barriers against the real breakthrough of biomass free systems . nowadays ethanol and biodiesel are produced from the same raw materials than food .
this is very inefficient and ethically daunting way for fuel production .
in order to make system more sustainable , the first step is to replace food-based raw materials by more efficient and ethical feedstock .
practically this means organic waste falls , forests and special bioenergy crops and algae . considerable number of research and development is going on in this field .
the idea behind is to convert the biomass into the form of biofuel .
most of the resources are in development of physical , chemical and biochemical processes that can be used to produce biofuels from whatever bulk biomass .
other important area is to explore and develop new plants , which are more suitable for biofuel production as compared to the traditional food crops . agro , forest and oil industry is already involved in developing these systems and they no doubt believe that this will be a business .
indeed , the conversion of bulk biomass into liquid fuels can strongly increase the biofuel production .
however , to be honest , biomass never can replace oil , unless the energy consumption on human population will drop to a fraction of the present one , which will not happen without nuclear war-like catastrophe . the fundamental problem of biomass is that plants store the energy from sunlight into their biomass very inefficiently .
plants are not evolved to be the feedstock of energy production for human activities .
in order to make accumulation of biomass more efficient plants must be pushed to store solar energy many times more efficiently than they do in the nature .
however , plants are so complicated organisms that most probably this will be a mission impossible . as compared to real plants , unicellular algae are simpler and easier to manipulate .
only one type of cell does the all tasks from harvesting the light energy to storage of the energy and for reproduction .
moreover , algae can grow in seawater , which is a great advance when compared to plants . under certain conditions algae can double the biomass in one day and large share of this biomass can be starch or oil , which are easy and energy efficient to convert into form of alcohol or biodiesel .
this means that algae can be much more efficient feedstock for biomass based biofuels than higher plants , particularly for biodiesel formation . the most promising feature of algae is , however , that they can produce molecular hydrogen directly from sunlight and water .
in the nature , this pathway is a kind of emergency valve and function only under very specific conditions .
as such , it has very minor capacity in natural algae .
the existence of this pathway , however , gives a great opportunity to bioscientists to use metabolic engineering in order to make hydrogen production very efficient . what are the benefits of these alternatives ? the main benefit is that there is no competition with food supply .
these alternatives are also very efficient .
in theory , solarbiohydrogen can be a real option for fossil fuels . what effect would the production of these alternatives have on the current production processes of biofuels -lrb- e.g. use of agricultural land , economies in places like brazil , the environment , the alleged contribution to the current food crisis -rrb- ? in general , sunlight is the driving force of the all new systems .
because algae can grow in salt water , the needed water can be pumped from the seas .
when the microalgal solarbiohydrogen systems will be fully developed , indeed , the limiting factor for hydrogen production will be size of bioreactors and availability of solar energy for algal photosynthesis . in present world , there is nearly absolute negative correlation between gdp and high mean daily irradiance .
in the future , when the sunlight will be the main energy source for the need of human beings , the today 's poorest countries will have something that rich countries really are craving .
this means for sure , that new energy business will colonize these poor but very sunny countries in africa and asia . there is no real democracy in these countries , and because of this , there is a risk that the money will flow to the rulers and solar energy money will spread the " middle east " all over central and north africa .
however , if western governments and public organizations monitor the technology transfer , the new energy technology will be a great opportunity to the developing countries . the basic idea of new generation biofuels is not to compete with resources needed to food production .
if in the future the sunny poor countries will be real players in global energy market , it means resources for them .
technology transfer must be linked to the requirements providing that the benefits will be used to modernize the whole society starting from agriculture . would the eu be interested in adopting fuels made from these alternatives or are they focused on ethanol and others ? eu has already a roadmap for a hydrogen economy .
ethanol is not the best solution and the eu knows this .
biodiesel from microalgae is a very attractive option for the eu as well . how easy or hard would it be to produce these alternatives and introduce them into industry and society ? biomass based systems are quite easy .
basically we have the technology , but low energy prices hinder the scaling up of the pilot scale plants .
when the oil price reaches a certain threshold , these technologies will take their part in the energy market . solarbiohydrogen , artificial photosynthesis and other these kinds of more advanced systems are still under development and some fundamental questions need to be solved before commercialisation .
however , the concept is clear and there should n't be anything in this respect that is not possible to solve . what is needed to make the system run is money and smart people .
if industry starts to finance the projects , investments must be a part of their long-term business strategy .
society has to accept genetic manipulation .
in advanced bioenergy field we ca n't do anything without all the tools of modern biotechnology .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.09.2008 opinion : american banks lose more than just money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choked by the credit crisis , lehman brothers , the 158-year-old us investment bank , has filed for bankruptcy .
the crisis underscores how banks have squandered their most prized asset - trust - says dw 's karl zawadzky . trust is the beginning of everything .
and now , mistrust is the end of everything .
this was illustrated dramatically by events on wall street on monday .
trust in the stability of large american banks has evaporated , and mistrust now reigns on wall street as well as in financial districts in london , frankfurt and tokyo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking crisis has now claimed lehman brothers , america 's fourth-largest investment bank .
the institute was founded 158 years ago by german immigrants and recently has posted billion-strong losses quarter after quarter .
in the second quarter of this year , the institution registered a record loss of $ 4 million .
the frantic search for a new cash injection turned out to be in vain . on sunday night , the bank 's management had no choice but to file for chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy filing ever .
that has won the bank a little time to find fresh funds or perhaps to be taken under the wings of another large bank . if that does n't work out , liquidation of a once strong and proud bank is certain .
america 's third-largest investment bank , merrill lynch , has found a savior for now with the bank of america taking over the stricken institution . the shockwaves from reeling us financial markets has pushed global share markets into the red .
there remains no doubt that the international banking crisis has reached a new danger level .
the us government and the federal reserve are no longer prepared to take responsibility for the mistakes of private banks . six months ago , they facilitated the emergency sale of the comparatively small investment bank bear stearns to the financial institution j.p. morgan chase with a massive loan .
they also bailed out mortgage banks fannie mae and freddie mac with the staggering sum of $ 5 trillion .
but now apparently it 's the end of state bailouts or maybe the american state has reached the limits of its financial largesse .
after all , this is about a lot of money . lehman brothers has debts worth $ 613 billion .
of course , the government and the federal reserve will try to avoid a domino effect .
but first it 's up to the private financial sector to step in - not with words but with money .
ten leading international banks , including germany 's deutsche bank , are pooling in $ 70 billion in a fund to help each other with possible cash crunches . lehman brothers , a renowned traditional bank , is in a tailspin .
without a large investor - with really deep pockets - the end of the bank is nigh .
the bank first squandered away its billions and then fell victim to the raging mistrust in financial markets . lehman is n't the first bank to suffer this fate and probably wo n't be the last .
the current banking crisis is the result of too much cheap federal reserve money , endless greed and overly generous banking supervision .
that explains the mistakes and extremes rife in the current financial disaster . germany is also affected by it .
german banks have irresponsibly speculated with bad american mortgages .
but in america , the crisis has a whole new dimension .
the result is n't just a financial disaster but also a political scandal . after the profits have been privatized , the losses are now being nationalized .
even if governments and federal reserves do n't stand by threatened banks , the banking crisis emanating from the us has squeezed the world economy . everybody is paying a price for the wrong acts of some .
in this context , calls for a stronger regulation of the financial sector are understandable .
banks have simply squandered trust .
but let 's not forget that it 's not money but rather the trust of investors and customers that is the most prized asset of banks .
that asset has been severely abused . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .

"
the eu-brokered cease-fire left moscow with too much leeway , he said . scheffer blamed oversights in an eu-brokered peace deal for not demanding the full withdrawal of troops to their bases in russia before the war with georgia last month . the nato secretary-general made the comments in an interview with the financial times shortly before he travelled to tbilisi on monday , sept .
15 , in a show of support for georgia 's nato membership ambitions . " if the russians are staying in south ossetia with so many forces , i do not consider this as a return to the status quo , " scheffer told the british newspaper .
" the option of keeping russian forces in south ossetia and abkhazia is not acceptable . " scheffer later on monday denied portions of the report in which he was critical of the georgia peace deal , saying he had only raised concerns about russia 's implementation of it . " the secretary-general remains fully supportive of the agreement negotiated by president sarkozy , " nato spokesman james appathurai said , according to the afp news agency .
" he has , however , expressed reservations about russia 's implementation of the six-point plan , in particular with regard to their returning to pre-aug .
7 positions . " he has never criticised the eu and certainly not on this agreement , " appathurai added . a day after signing last week 's peace accord , moscow said near 8,000 troops would stay in the separatist regions , where considerably fewer of its peacekeepers patrolled under a un mandate before the conflict . nato showing support for georgia the object of the two-day georgia trip by ambassadors from the 26 nato member states will be ongoing talks - insistently backed by the united states - on extending georgia membership in the alliance . despite the urgency now surrounding georgia 's accession talks in the wake of the conflict with russia , nato members are far from decided on further expansion into the former soviet territory . western europe - germany , france , spain and italy - beg to delay inviting georgia and ukraine under its security umbrella , fearing a nightmare scenario in which alliance troops could face off with russian forces in eastern europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer russia and nato froze relations last month , and scheffer , who has been particularly critical of the kremlin over the conflict , said " a speedy revival of the nato-russia council will not be easy . " at the same time , russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov was wrapping up a tour of georgia 's separatist region of abkhazia and south ossetia , underscoring the rift with the west since russia recognized both provinces ' claims to independence . lavrov slammed scheffer 's politics , speaking in the abkhaz capital of sukhumi on sunday . " of course i 've heard the declarations he makes , declarations that are inappropriate for the leader of such a serious organization , " he was quoted by interfax news agency as saying . russia 's top diplomat on monday was due in the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali , where the fighting erupted on aug .
8 . peace accord leaves many in eu unsettled in brussels , the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana affirmed the european union was ready to replace russian troops in georgia with its own civilian observers within the next two weeks . but many in europe have been feeling burned by the rushed peace deal negotiated by french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the eu rotating presidency . vagueness in the accord has allowed moscow to say it provides only for the 200-strong eu mission to deploy in " buffer zones , " effectively giving the eu observers a role of safeguarding the boundaries of georgia 's separatists . those regions are part of georgian territory , the eu has said , but an agreement to tackle the status of the regions in peace talks was also dropped by moscow in the latest pact that provides for peace talks in geneva next month . some russian forces had pulled out from positions deep inside georgia at its black sea port of poti over the weekend in accord with monday 's deadline for the first phase of a withdrawal . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports energy -pipe- 15.09.2008 science edges towards a new generation of biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to biofuels such as ethanol from sugar cane could still help support economies dw-world.de talked to prof. eva-mari aro , an expert on plant physiology and molecular biology at the university of turku in finland , about the current developments in the pursuit of new biofuel technologies . dw-world.de : what are the most viable alternatives to biofuels like ethanol and how do they work ? eva-mari aro : new generation biofuels can be roughly divided into two groups : fuels , which use biomass as a raw material and systems where living organisms -lrb- or biomimicing devices -rrb- produce some liquid fuel , hydrogen or other gas directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide . biomass based biofuels are already close to real application and their breakthrough is mostly dependent on oil price .
however , accumulation of biomass is thermodynamically inefficient process and the conversion of biomass into the form liquid fuel decreases the efficiency more .
biomass has very low efficiency to store energy from sunlight and even in ideal situation they can replace only some percents from fossil fuels .
anyway , they are considered to be a good business when oil prise increases enough . biomass independent systems , in contrast , have very high efficacy in theory , and have real potential to replace fossil fuels .
however , there are still unsolved technical barriers against the real breakthrough of biomass free systems . nowadays ethanol and biodiesel are produced from the same raw materials than food .
this is very inefficient and ethically daunting way for fuel production .
in order to make system more sustainable , the first step is to replace food-based raw materials by more efficient and ethical feedstock .
practically this means organic waste falls , forests and special bioenergy crops and algae . considerable number of research and development is going on in this field .
the idea behind is to convert the biomass into the form of biofuel .
most of the resources are in development of physical , chemical and biochemical processes that can be used to produce biofuels from whatever bulk biomass .
other important area is to explore and develop new plants , which are more suitable for biofuel production as compared to the traditional food crops . agro , forest and oil industry is already involved in developing these systems and they no doubt believe that this will be a business .
indeed , the conversion of bulk biomass into liquid fuels can strongly increase the biofuel production .
however , to be honest , biomass never can replace oil , unless the energy consumption on human population will drop to a fraction of the present one , which will not happen without nuclear war-like catastrophe . the fundamental problem of biomass is that plants store the energy from sunlight into their biomass very inefficiently .
plants are not evolved to be the feedstock of energy production for human activities .
in order to make accumulation of biomass more efficient plants must be pushed to store solar energy many times more efficiently than they do in the nature .
however , plants are so complicated organisms that most probably this will be a mission impossible . as compared to real plants , unicellular algae are simpler and easier to manipulate .
only one type of cell does the all tasks from harvesting the light energy to storage of the energy and for reproduction .
moreover , algae can grow in seawater , which is a great advance when compared to plants . under certain conditions algae can double the biomass in one day and large share of this biomass can be starch or oil , which are easy and energy efficient to convert into form of alcohol or biodiesel .
this means that algae can be much more efficient feedstock for biomass based biofuels than higher plants , particularly for biodiesel formation . the most promising feature of algae is , however , that they can produce molecular hydrogen directly from sunlight and water .
in the nature , this pathway is a kind of emergency valve and function only under very specific conditions .
as such , it has very minor capacity in natural algae .
the existence of this pathway , however , gives a great opportunity to bioscientists to use metabolic engineering in order to make hydrogen production very efficient . what are the benefits of these alternatives ? the main benefit is that there is no competition with food supply .
these alternatives are also very efficient .
in theory , solarbiohydrogen can be a real option for fossil fuels . what effect would the production of these alternatives have on the current production processes of biofuels -lrb- e.g. use of agricultural land , economies in places like brazil , the environment , the alleged contribution to the current food crisis -rrb- ? in general , sunlight is the driving force of the all new systems .
because algae can grow in salt water , the needed water can be pumped from the seas .
when the microalgal solarbiohydrogen systems will be fully developed , indeed , the limiting factor for hydrogen production will be size of bioreactors and availability of solar energy for algal photosynthesis . in present world , there is nearly absolute negative correlation between gdp and high mean daily irradiance .
in the future , when the sunlight will be the main energy source for the need of human beings , the today 's poorest countries will have something that rich countries really are craving .
this means for sure , that new energy business will colonize these poor but very sunny countries in africa and asia . there is no real democracy in these countries , and because of this , there is a risk that the money will flow to the rulers and solar energy money will spread the " middle east " all over central and north africa .
however , if western governments and public organizations monitor the technology transfer , the new energy technology will be a great opportunity to the developing countries . the basic idea of new generation biofuels is not to compete with resources needed to food production .
if in the future the sunny poor countries will be real players in global energy market , it means resources for them .
technology transfer must be linked to the requirements providing that the benefits will be used to modernize the whole society starting from agriculture . would the eu be interested in adopting fuels made from these alternatives or are they focused on ethanol and others ? eu has already a roadmap for a hydrogen economy .
ethanol is not the best solution and the eu knows this .
biodiesel from microalgae is a very attractive option for the eu as well . how easy or hard would it be to produce these alternatives and introduce them into industry and society ? biomass based systems are quite easy .
basically we have the technology , but low energy prices hinder the scaling up of the pilot scale plants .
when the oil price reaches a certain threshold , these technologies will take their part in the energy market . solarbiohydrogen , artificial photosynthesis and other these kinds of more advanced systems are still under development and some fundamental questions need to be solved before commercialisation .
however , the concept is clear and there should n't be anything in this respect that is not possible to solve . what is needed to make the system run is money and smart people .
if industry starts to finance the projects , investments must be a part of their long-term business strategy .
society has to accept genetic manipulation .
in advanced bioenergy field we ca n't do anything without all the tools of modern biotechnology .
anti genetically modified organism -lrb- gmo -rrb- people really should think what the price of banning gmos would be . in general , when massive amounts of hydrogen flow out from bioreactors , everything after that will go fluently .
the transfer from an oil economy to a hydrogen economy is just a set of political decisions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports energy -pipe- 15.09.2008 science edges towards a new generation of biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to biofuels such as ethanol from sugar cane could still help support economies dw-world.de talked to prof. eva-mari aro , an expert on plant physiology and molecular biology at the university of turku in finland , about the current developments in the pursuit of new biofuel technologies . dw-world.de : what are the most viable alternatives to biofuels like ethanol and how do they work ? eva-mari aro : new generation biofuels can be roughly divided into two groups : fuels , which use biomass as a raw material and systems where living organisms -lrb- or biomimicing devices -rrb- produce some liquid fuel , hydrogen or other gas directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide . biomass based biofuels are already close to real application and their breakthrough is mostly dependent on oil price .
however , accumulation of biomass is thermodynamically inefficient process and the conversion of biomass into the form liquid fuel decreases the efficiency more .
biomass has very low efficiency to store energy from sunlight and even in ideal situation they can replace only some percents from fossil fuels .
anyway , they are considered to be a good business when oil prise increases enough . biomass independent systems , in contrast , have very high efficacy in theory , and have real potential to replace fossil fuels .
however , there are still unsolved technical barriers against the real breakthrough of biomass free systems . nowadays ethanol and biodiesel are produced from the same raw materials than food .
this is very inefficient and ethically daunting way for fuel production .
in order to make system more sustainable , the first step is to replace food-based raw materials by more efficient and ethical feedstock .
practically this means organic waste falls , forests and special bioenergy crops and algae . considerable number of research and development is going on in this field .
the idea behind is to convert the biomass into the form of biofuel .
most of the resources are in development of physical , chemical and biochemical processes that can be used to produce biofuels from whatever bulk biomass .
other important area is to explore and develop new plants , which are more suitable for biofuel production as compared to the traditional food crops . agro , forest and oil industry is already involved in developing these systems and they no doubt believe that this will be a business .
indeed , the conversion of bulk biomass into liquid fuels can strongly increase the biofuel production .
however , to be honest , biomass never can replace oil , unless the energy consumption on human population will drop to a fraction of the present one , which will not happen without nuclear war-like catastrophe . the fundamental problem of biomass is that plants store the energy from sunlight into their biomass very inefficiently .
plants are not evolved to be the feedstock of energy production for human activities .
in order to make accumulation of biomass more efficient plants must be pushed to store solar energy many times more efficiently than they do in the nature .
however , plants are so complicated organisms that most probably this will be a mission impossible . as compared to real plants , unicellular algae are simpler and easier to manipulate .
only one type of cell does the all tasks from harvesting the light energy to storage of the energy and for reproduction .
moreover , algae can grow in seawater , which is a great advance when compared to plants . under certain conditions algae can double the biomass in one day and large share of this biomass can be starch or oil , which are easy and energy efficient to convert into form of alcohol or biodiesel .
this means that algae can be much more efficient feedstock for biomass based biofuels than higher plants , particularly for biodiesel formation . the most promising feature of algae is , however , that they can produce molecular hydrogen directly from sunlight and water .
in the nature , this pathway is a kind of emergency valve and function only under very specific conditions .
as such , it has very minor capacity in natural algae .
the existence of this pathway , however , gives a great opportunity to bioscientists to use metabolic engineering in order to make hydrogen production very efficient . what are the benefits of these alternatives ? the main benefit is that there is no competition with food supply .
these alternatives are also very efficient .
in theory , solarbiohydrogen can be a real option for fossil fuels . what effect would the production of these alternatives have on the current production processes of biofuels -lrb- e.g. use of agricultural land , economies in places like brazil , the environment , the alleged contribution to the current food crisis -rrb- ? in general , sunlight is the driving force of the all new systems .

the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's continued presence in abkhazia and south ossetia remains controversial . the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states are expected to launch a mission of at least 200 civilian observers to georgia in return for a russian military withdrawal .
that follows an agreement brokered by french president nicolas sarkozy - current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency - under which the observers are to deploy by oct .
1 and russia is to withdraw its troops from georgia proper by 10 days later .
officials in brussels say that 11 member states - the baltic states , belgium , britain , france , germany , italy , poland , spain and sweden - have already offered to send personnel and equipment .
but debate remains over the precise wording of the mission 's mandate , with some member states pushing for a specific mention of the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia - now occupied by russia - which says they are independent , and others saying the wording should be more ambiguous , to avoid antagonizing moscow .
trade deal with serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radovan karadzic was arrested in belgrade and handed over to the hague tribunal at the same meeting , the ministers are expected to debate whether they should implement a trade deal with serbia following belgrade 's arrest of war-crimes suspect radovan karadzic in july .
the netherlands say they will not approve the implementation of the deal until the chief prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , serge brammertz , confirms that belgrade is fully cooperating with his organization .
brammertz is expected to attend the meeting .
debate also remains over whether the eu should reward belarus for its decision over the summer to release political prisoners .
some member states say that the eu should send minsk a " strong message " ahead of elections on sept .
28 by lifting sanctions against the regime of president alexander lukashenko .
others say this should be done after the election - making it likely that ministers will content themselves with issuing an encouraging statement .
sanctions against zimbabwe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe , left , and tsvangirai reached a last-minute power-sharing deal turning from incentives to sanctions , eu officials on thursday agreed that the ministers should broaden their current sanctions against zimbabwe in light of the summer 's political violence .
but the news overnight that president robert mugabe and his challenger morgan tsvangirai had reached a power-sharing deal led officials to say on friday that those sanctions could now be delayed .
ministers are expected to approve a letter officially calling for crisis talks with the military junta which seized power in mauritania on aug .

under article 96 of the so-called cotonou agreement between the eu and african , caribbean and pacific states , the eu could cut off aid to the government if talks are rejected .
finally , the ministers are expected to offer the eu 's support to naval operations against piracy in somalia .
however , the bloc is not expected to launch any mission of its own . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more losses are likely , a german economist told dw . dr. michael schroeder is the head of the department of international finance and financial management at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , a non-profit economic research institute in mannheim , germany . deutsche welle : dr. schroeder , how will lehman 's collapse affect europe ? michael schroeder : that question is difficult to answer .
lehman does n't have much systemic risk , or risk with a high probability that it will pull down other banks in its wake .
so i do n't expect the direct counterparts in the banking sector will be hit very strongly . but it is a signal that much greater-than-expected problems in the banking sector are yet to come .
some experts thought one or two months ago that the worse of the subprime crisis was over .
but as we see in the news , this is not the case .
it was very optimistic . world stock markets dropped sharply at the lehman bankruptcy news .
why does the failure of one us bank have such far-reaching financial effects ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says more problems are yet to come i think it has to do with the fact that there still very high losses to come in the near future .
we see that hedge funds , or so-called monoline insurance companies , or other banking institutions could go bankrupt or near-bankrupt by the end of the year - particularly in the us but also perhaps in europe , due to collateral damage in the sector . the expectations are now that high losses could come in the next two or three months .
this will also hurt the business cycle in europe .
but it is difficult to predict to how great an extent ; how strong the impact will be . should consumers in germany be concerned ? well , yes , german consumers should be concerned because the business cycle will be relatively weak over the next year .
but the consumers themselves are part of the problem .
the economy gets weaker , they become more risk averse , then they consume less , and it drives the cycle downwards . ...
germans should consumer more , to combat this cycle . the us government opted not to bail out lehman .
yet the german government recently went to the aid of the ikb bank , when that lender nearly collapsed in the wake of the subprime crisis ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billions of euros were spent bailing out the ikb bank i think bailing out banks or companies has a lot to do with so-called systemic risks .
i do not expect that lehman really will have a strong effect on other banks or banking systems … so the us was right for not bailing out lehman brothers , in my opinion . i also did n't understand why the german government bailed out ikb .
in my opinion it was absolutely unnecessary , and it imposes relatively high costs to the taxpayers in germany . one us analyst is comparing this monday to a certain black monday back in 1929 .
is that realistic ? that is absolutely exaggerated ...
i do n't believe we have an unmanageable , or even an extremely strong , crisis right now .
the stock markets and all the other markets have reacted realistically . there are , of course , very high losses .
but it is not a catastrophe . is there a lesson to draw from this turn of events ? we need a new framework for the banking industry that should be instituted when this crisis is over .

the economy gets weaker , they become more risk averse , then they consume less , and it drives the cycle downwards . ...
germans should consumer more , to combat this cycle . the us government opted not to bail out lehman .
yet the german government recently went to the aid of the ikb bank , when that lender nearly collapsed in the wake of the subprime crisis ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billions of euros were spent bailing out the ikb bank i think bailing out banks or companies has a lot to do with so-called systemic risks .
i do not expect that lehman really will have a strong effect on other banks or banking systems … so the us was right for not bailing out lehman brothers , in my opinion . i also did n't understand why the german government bailed out ikb .
in my opinion it was absolutely unnecessary , and it imposes relatively high costs to the taxpayers in germany . one us analyst is comparing this monday to a certain black monday back in 1929 .
is that realistic ? that is absolutely exaggerated ...
i do n't believe we have an unmanageable , or even an extremely strong , crisis right now .
the stock markets and all the other markets have reacted realistically . there are , of course , very high losses .
but it is not a catastrophe . is there a lesson to draw from this turn of events ? we need a new framework for the banking industry that should be instituted when this crisis is over .
we need clear rules that say when to bail out and when not to bail out a company . politicians should make it clear that banks can go bankrupt . ...
there are many medium size banks that should be allowed to go bankrupt when they have no liquidity anymore . we also need to have a framework for how it should be handled when a bank is bailed out .
managers should n't be allowed to get away with being extremely risk-loving and then not have to pay the price if that strategy fails . when the economy absorbs losses it should be clear who has to pay for these losses .
the taxpayer should n't always have to pay . interview : mark hallam , jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 15.09.2008 conductor lorin maazel : masterpieces survive everything großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel said he looks forward to spending more time composing entering his final season as music director of the prestigious new york philharmonic , lorin maazel told dw-world.de about the legacy he leaves behind with the orchestra and his plans to compose and found a new festival . lorin maazel assumed the post of music director at the new york philharmonic , the oldest standing orchestra in the united states , in 2002 and will pass it on to alan gilbert at the end of the 2008-2009 season .
the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , the bloc 's priority was to deploy 200 observers in georgia before oct . 1 , in compliance with a ceasefire brokered by french president nicolas sarkozy earlier this month . " after that , we will see how the situation evolves , " solana said ahead of talks with eu foreign ministers in brussels .
on sunday , russia completed the withdrawal of its troops from western georgia , including the strategically important black sea port of poti , in accordance with the eu ceasefire deal .
the agreement reached on sept .
8 states that the eu must have at least 200 observers in georgia by oct .
1 if russia is to withdraw its troops from the buffer zones that it has since created .
" the withdrawal is a process , and we are glad that it has started , " said eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
diplomats say that 11 countries - the baltic states , belgium , britain , france , germany , italy , poland , spain and sweden - have already pledged support for the eu mission .
" we are very committed to making sure that we play our full part in that important mission , meeting the deadline and getting the right number of people in at the right time to the right places , " british foreign minister david miliband said .
russia against eu observers in breakaway regions the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is already mandated to post observers in south ossetia , and talks are under way to boost their number by another 80 , said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who currently holds the osce 's rotating presidency .
" we have a mandate to go into south ossetia for 80 people .

" we need the agreement of all sides involved , because we do not want to act as an occupying force , " italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
some member states are pushing for a specific reference to the breakaway regions , while others argue that the wording should be left ambiguous to avoid antagonizing moscow , diplomats said ahead of the meeting .
" we are ready and disposed to go beyond the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- commitments into other places , but we have to see how the situation evolves on the ground , " solana said monday .

the additional money comes on top of the roughly 100 million euros already being planned for georgia this year , and it will add to any bilateral aid being provided by the eu 's individual member states .
the money would be spread over the 2008-2010 period and would be used in four major areas : refugees and internally displaced people , economic recovery , financial stabilization and infrastructure .

the life imprisonment sentence , handed down in september 2006 , can not be enforced because germany does not extradite its own citizens .
german prosecutors in munich are expected to present many of the same documents and witnesses who described at the italy trial how the germans shot three men and a woman on the first day of the reprisal .
the next day , 11 males were locked inside the ground floor of the home of a villager , ferdinando cannicci , and it was blown up .

at italy 's request , german police interviewed him before the la spezia trial .
he confirmed he had been an officer of company 1 , battalion 818 of the mountain combat engineers in italy , but denied the atrocity .

ambush leads to reprisals on june 26 , partisans ambushed a three-man german patrol as it was about to requisition a horse in falzano .
two germans were killed without warning , but the third man got away only slightly wounded and told his fellow engineers .
the company 's lieutenant and his superior , a major in charge of the whole battalion , allegedly decided the engineers should mount a reprisal on the hamlet , which is in the hills making up the " backbone " of the italian peninsula between siena and perugia .
members of company 1 shot up the area , with a german anti-aircraft unit firing over it to scare off partisans .
four people , including a 74-year-old woman , were shot dead purely because they got in the way of the rampage .
later , the italians were forced to watch as charges were placed under their homes in the hamlet and they were blown up .
the men aged 16 to 66 were herded into one house and it was dynamited .

the crisis underscores how banks have squandered their most prized asset - trust - says dw 's karl zawadzky . trust is the beginning of everything .
and now , mistrust is the end of everything .
this was illustrated dramatically by events on wall street on monday .
trust in the stability of large american banks has evaporated , and mistrust now reigns on wall street as well as in financial districts in london , frankfurt and tokyo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking crisis has now claimed lehman brothers , america 's fourth-largest investment bank .
the institute was founded 158 years ago by german immigrants and recently has posted billion-strong losses quarter after quarter .
in the second quarter of this year , the institution registered a record loss of $ 4 million .
the frantic search for a new cash injection turned out to be in vain . on sunday night , the bank 's management had no choice but to file for chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy filing ever .
that has won the bank a little time to find fresh funds or perhaps to be taken under the wings of another large bank . if that does n't work out , liquidation of a once strong and proud bank is certain .
america 's third-largest investment bank , merrill lynch , has found a savior for now with the bank of america taking over the stricken institution . the shockwaves from reeling us financial markets has pushed global share markets into the red .
there remains no doubt that the international banking crisis has reached a new danger level .
the us government and the federal reserve are no longer prepared to take responsibility for the mistakes of private banks . six months ago , they facilitated the emergency sale of the comparatively small investment bank bear stearns to the financial institution j.p. morgan chase with a massive loan .
they also bailed out mortgage banks fannie mae and freddie mac with the staggering sum of $ 5 trillion .
but now apparently it 's the end of state bailouts or maybe the american state has reached the limits of its financial largesse .
after all , this is about a lot of money . lehman brothers has debts worth $ 613 billion .
of course , the government and the federal reserve will try to avoid a domino effect .
but first it 's up to the private financial sector to step in - not with words but with money .
ten leading international banks , including germany 's deutsche bank , are pooling in $ 70 billion in a fund to help each other with possible cash crunches . lehman brothers , a renowned traditional bank , is in a tailspin .
without a large investor - with really deep pockets - the end of the bank is nigh .
the bank first squandered away its billions and then fell victim to the raging mistrust in financial markets . lehman is n't the first bank to suffer this fate and probably wo n't be the last .
the current banking crisis is the result of too much cheap federal reserve money , endless greed and overly generous banking supervision .
that explains the mistakes and extremes rife in the current financial disaster . germany is also affected by it .
german banks have irresponsibly speculated with bad american mortgages .
but in america , the crisis has a whole new dimension .
the result is n't just a financial disaster but also a political scandal . after the profits have been privatized , the losses are now being nationalized .
even if governments and federal reserves do n't stand by threatened banks , the banking crisis emanating from the us has squeezed the world economy . everybody is paying a price for the wrong acts of some .
in this context , calls for a stronger regulation of the financial sector are understandable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 15.09.2008 conductor lorin maazel : masterpieces survive everything großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel said he looks forward to spending more time composing entering his final season as music director of the prestigious new york philharmonic , lorin maazel told dw-world.de about the legacy he leaves behind with the orchestra and his plans to compose and found a new festival . lorin maazel assumed the post of music director at the new york philharmonic , the oldest standing orchestra in the united states , in 2002 and will pass it on to alan gilbert at the end of the 2008-2009 season .
the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .

the crisis underscores how banks have squandered their most prized asset - trust - says dw 's karl zawadzky . trust is the beginning of everything .
and now , mistrust is the end of everything .
this was illustrated dramatically by events on wall street on monday .
trust in the stability of large american banks has evaporated , and mistrust now reigns on wall street as well as in financial districts in london , frankfurt and tokyo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking crisis has now claimed lehman brothers , america 's fourth-largest investment bank .
the institute was founded 158 years ago by german immigrants and recently has posted billion-strong losses quarter after quarter .
in the second quarter of this year , the institution registered a record loss of $ 4 million .
the frantic search for a new cash injection turned out to be in vain . on sunday night , the bank 's management had no choice but to file for chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy filing ever .
that has won the bank a little time to find fresh funds or perhaps to be taken under the wings of another large bank . if that does n't work out , liquidation of a once strong and proud bank is certain .
america 's third-largest investment bank , merrill lynch , has found a savior for now with the bank of america taking over the stricken institution . the shockwaves from reeling us financial markets has pushed global share markets into the red .
there remains no doubt that the international banking crisis has reached a new danger level .
the us government and the federal reserve are no longer prepared to take responsibility for the mistakes of private banks . six months ago , they facilitated the emergency sale of the comparatively small investment bank bear stearns to the financial institution j.p. morgan chase with a massive loan .
they also bailed out mortgage banks fannie mae and freddie mac with the staggering sum of $ 5 trillion .
but now apparently it 's the end of state bailouts or maybe the american state has reached the limits of its financial largesse .
after all , this is about a lot of money . lehman brothers has debts worth $ 613 billion .
of course , the government and the federal reserve will try to avoid a domino effect .
but first it 's up to the private financial sector to step in - not with words but with money .
ten leading international banks , including germany 's deutsche bank , are pooling in $ 70 billion in a fund to help each other with possible cash crunches . lehman brothers , a renowned traditional bank , is in a tailspin .
without a large investor - with really deep pockets - the end of the bank is nigh .
the bank first squandered away its billions and then fell victim to the raging mistrust in financial markets . lehman is n't the first bank to suffer this fate and probably wo n't be the last .
the current banking crisis is the result of too much cheap federal reserve money , endless greed and overly generous banking supervision .
that explains the mistakes and extremes rife in the current financial disaster . germany is also affected by it .
german banks have irresponsibly speculated with bad american mortgages .
but in america , the crisis has a whole new dimension .
the result is n't just a financial disaster but also a political scandal . after the profits have been privatized , the losses are now being nationalized .
even if governments and federal reserves do n't stand by threatened banks , the banking crisis emanating from the us has squeezed the world economy . everybody is paying a price for the wrong acts of some .
in this context , calls for a stronger regulation of the financial sector are understandable .
banks have simply squandered trust .
but let 's not forget that it 's not money but rather the trust of investors and customers that is the most prized asset of banks .

the crisis underscores how banks have squandered their most prized asset - trust - says dw 's karl zawadzky . trust is the beginning of everything .
and now , mistrust is the end of everything .
this was illustrated dramatically by events on wall street on monday .
trust in the stability of large american banks has evaporated , and mistrust now reigns on wall street as well as in financial districts in london , frankfurt and tokyo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking crisis has now claimed lehman brothers , america 's fourth-largest investment bank .
the institute was founded 158 years ago by german immigrants and recently has posted billion-strong losses quarter after quarter .
in the second quarter of this year , the institution registered a record loss of $ 4 million .
the frantic search for a new cash injection turned out to be in vain . on sunday night , the bank 's management had no choice but to file for chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy filing ever .
that has won the bank a little time to find fresh funds or perhaps to be taken under the wings of another large bank . if that does n't work out , liquidation of a once strong and proud bank is certain .
america 's third-largest investment bank , merrill lynch , has found a savior for now with the bank of america taking over the stricken institution . the shockwaves from reeling us financial markets has pushed global share markets into the red .
there remains no doubt that the international banking crisis has reached a new danger level .
the us government and the federal reserve are no longer prepared to take responsibility for the mistakes of private banks . six months ago , they facilitated the emergency sale of the comparatively small investment bank bear stearns to the financial institution j.p. morgan chase with a massive loan .
they also bailed out mortgage banks fannie mae and freddie mac with the staggering sum of $ 5 trillion .
but now apparently it 's the end of state bailouts or maybe the american state has reached the limits of its financial largesse .
after all , this is about a lot of money . lehman brothers has debts worth $ 613 billion .
of course , the government and the federal reserve will try to avoid a domino effect .
but first it 's up to the private financial sector to step in - not with words but with money .
ten leading international banks , including germany 's deutsche bank , are pooling in $ 70 billion in a fund to help each other with possible cash crunches . lehman brothers , a renowned traditional bank , is in a tailspin .
without a large investor - with really deep pockets - the end of the bank is nigh .
the bank first squandered away its billions and then fell victim to the raging mistrust in financial markets . lehman is n't the first bank to suffer this fate and probably wo n't be the last .
the current banking crisis is the result of too much cheap federal reserve money , endless greed and overly generous banking supervision .
that explains the mistakes and extremes rife in the current financial disaster . germany is also affected by it .
german banks have irresponsibly speculated with bad american mortgages .
but in america , the crisis has a whole new dimension .
the result is n't just a financial disaster but also a political scandal . after the profits have been privatized , the losses are now being nationalized .
even if governments and federal reserves do n't stand by threatened banks , the banking crisis emanating from the us has squeezed the world economy . everybody is paying a price for the wrong acts of some .
in this context , calls for a stronger regulation of the financial sector are understandable .
banks have simply squandered trust .
but let 's not forget that it 's not money but rather the trust of investors and customers that is the most prized asset of banks .
that asset has been severely abused . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de after lehman , expert calls for framework on bank bailouts us banking giant lehman brothers is filing for bankruptcy , the latest us lender to bow to the pressures of the subprime mortgage crisis .
more losses are likely , a german economist told dw .
-lrb- 15.09.2008 -rrb- europe struggles with fallout from lehman failure european and asian share markets were badly shaken , as market indicators tumbled on the news that us investment bank lehman brothers would declare bankruptcy .
europe 's major central banks pledged their support .

lehman does n't have much systemic risk , or risk with a high probability that it will pull down other banks in its wake .
so i do n't expect the direct counterparts in the banking sector will be hit very strongly . but it is a signal that much greater-than-expected problems in the banking sector are yet to come .
some experts thought one or two months ago that the worse of the subprime crisis was over .
but as we see in the news , this is not the case .
it was very optimistic . world stock markets dropped sharply at the lehman bankruptcy news .
why does the failure of one us bank have such far-reaching financial effects ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says more problems are yet to come i think it has to do with the fact that there still very high losses to come in the near future .
we see that hedge funds , or so-called monoline insurance companies , or other banking institutions could go bankrupt or near-bankrupt by the end of the year - particularly in the us but also perhaps in europe , due to collateral damage in the sector . the expectations are now that high losses could come in the next two or three months .
this will also hurt the business cycle in europe .
but it is difficult to predict to how great an extent ; how strong the impact will be . should consumers in germany be concerned ? well , yes , german consumers should be concerned because the business cycle will be relatively weak over the next year .
but the consumers themselves are part of the problem .
the economy gets weaker , they become more risk averse , then they consume less , and it drives the cycle downwards . ...
germans should consumer more , to combat this cycle . the us government opted not to bail out lehman .
yet the german government recently went to the aid of the ikb bank , when that lender nearly collapsed in the wake of the subprime crisis ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billions of euros were spent bailing out the ikb bank i think bailing out banks or companies has a lot to do with so-called systemic risks .
i do not expect that lehman really will have a strong effect on other banks or banking systems … so the us was right for not bailing out lehman brothers , in my opinion . i also did n't understand why the german government bailed out ikb .
in my opinion it was absolutely unnecessary , and it imposes relatively high costs to the taxpayers in germany . one us analyst is comparing this monday to a certain black monday back in 1929 .
is that realistic ? that is absolutely exaggerated ...
i do n't believe we have an unmanageable , or even an extremely strong , crisis right now .
the stock markets and all the other markets have reacted realistically . there are , of course , very high losses .
but it is not a catastrophe . is there a lesson to draw from this turn of events ? we need a new framework for the banking industry that should be instituted when this crisis is over .
we need clear rules that say when to bail out and when not to bail out a company . politicians should make it clear that banks can go bankrupt . ...
there are many medium size banks that should be allowed to go bankrupt when they have no liquidity anymore . we also need to have a framework for how it should be handled when a bank is bailed out .
managers should n't be allowed to get away with being extremely risk-loving and then not have to pay the price if that strategy fails . when the economy absorbs losses it should be clear who has to pay for these losses .

more losses are likely , a german economist told dw . dr. michael schroeder is the head of the department of international finance and financial management at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , a non-profit economic research institute in mannheim , germany . deutsche welle : dr. schroeder , how will lehman 's collapse affect europe ? michael schroeder : that question is difficult to answer .
lehman does n't have much systemic risk , or risk with a high probability that it will pull down other banks in its wake .
so i do n't expect the direct counterparts in the banking sector will be hit very strongly . but it is a signal that much greater-than-expected problems in the banking sector are yet to come .
some experts thought one or two months ago that the worse of the subprime crisis was over .
but as we see in the news , this is not the case .
it was very optimistic . world stock markets dropped sharply at the lehman bankruptcy news .

the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , the bloc 's priority was to deploy 200 observers in georgia before oct . 1 , in compliance with a ceasefire brokered by french president nicolas sarkozy earlier this month . " after that , we will see how the situation evolves , " solana said ahead of talks with eu foreign ministers in brussels .
on sunday , russia completed the withdrawal of its troops from western georgia , including the strategically important black sea port of poti , in accordance with the eu ceasefire deal .
the agreement reached on sept .
8 states that the eu must have at least 200 observers in georgia by oct .
1 if russia is to withdraw its troops from the buffer zones that it has since created .
" the withdrawal is a process , and we are glad that it has started , " said eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
diplomats say that 11 countries - the baltic states , belgium , britain , france , germany , italy , poland , spain and sweden - have already pledged support for the eu mission .
" we are very committed to making sure that we play our full part in that important mission , meeting the deadline and getting the right number of people in at the right time to the right places , " british foreign minister david miliband said .
russia against eu observers in breakaway regions the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is already mandated to post observers in south ossetia , and talks are under way to boost their number by another 80 , said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who currently holds the osce 's rotating presidency .
" we have a mandate to go into south ossetia for 80 people .
what the final outcome of the 80 will be we do n't know , that 's what the georgians and russians are discussing and i think it 's a very positive development because they 're sitting together around the table , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia resists the idea of eu observers in the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia russia has so far rejected any suggestion that the eu should send its own observers into the breakaway regions , leaving the eu 's foreign ministers walking a tight-rope as they draw up the mission 's mandate .
" we need the agreement of all sides involved , because we do not want to act as an occupying force , " italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
some member states are pushing for a specific reference to the breakaway regions , while others argue that the wording should be left ambiguous to avoid antagonizing moscow , diplomats said ahead of the meeting .
" we are ready and disposed to go beyond the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- commitments into other places , but we have to see how the situation evolves on the ground , " solana said monday .
brussles pledges more aid to georgia separately , benita ferrero-waldner said on monday the eu commission is ready to provide " up to 500 million euros " -lrb- $ 714 million -rrb- in additional aid to georgia to help rebuild its infrastructure after the war with russia .
the additional money comes on top of the roughly 100 million euros already being planned for georgia this year , and it will add to any bilateral aid being provided by the eu 's individual member states .
the money would be spread over the 2008-2010 period and would be used in four major areas : refugees and internally displaced people , economic recovery , financial stabilization and infrastructure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the war has battered buildings in some georgian towns the package would be made conditional on georgia enforcing democracy and political reform , ferrero-waldner said .
" the european commission is at the heart of efforts to rebuild stability and shattered confidence in georgia , " the commissioner said . " it is obvious that additional funds will be necessary , " she added .
though the package is also intended to cover georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , a decision to this effect would have to be taken " in phases , " the commissioner said .
ferrero-waldner also stressed the commission would do its utmost to ensure the money is not used by georgia to buy weapons .

brussles pledges more aid to georgia separately , benita ferrero-waldner said on monday the eu commission is ready to provide " up to 500 million euros " -lrb- $ 714 million -rrb- in additional aid to georgia to help rebuild its infrastructure after the war with russia .
the additional money comes on top of the roughly 100 million euros already being planned for georgia this year , and it will add to any bilateral aid being provided by the eu 's individual member states .
the money would be spread over the 2008-2010 period and would be used in four major areas : refugees and internally displaced people , economic recovery , financial stabilization and infrastructure .

" the european commission is at the heart of efforts to rebuild stability and shattered confidence in georgia , " the commissioner said . " it is obvious that additional funds will be necessary , " she added .
though the package is also intended to cover georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , a decision to this effect would have to be taken " in phases , " the commissioner said .
ferrero-waldner also stressed the commission would do its utmost to ensure the money is not used by georgia to buy weapons .
some recent reports have claimed that the georgian authorities are using current eu funding to purchase arms . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the eu-brokered cease-fire left moscow with too much leeway , he said . scheffer blamed oversights in an eu-brokered peace deal for not demanding the full withdrawal of troops to their bases in russia before the war with georgia last month . the nato secretary-general made the comments in an interview with the financial times shortly before he travelled to tbilisi on monday , sept .
15 , in a show of support for georgia 's nato membership ambitions . " if the russians are staying in south ossetia with so many forces , i do not consider this as a return to the status quo , " scheffer told the british newspaper .
" the option of keeping russian forces in south ossetia and abkhazia is not acceptable . " scheffer later on monday denied portions of the report in which he was critical of the georgia peace deal , saying he had only raised concerns about russia 's implementation of it . " the secretary-general remains fully supportive of the agreement negotiated by president sarkozy , " nato spokesman james appathurai said , according to the afp news agency .
" he has , however , expressed reservations about russia 's implementation of the six-point plan , in particular with regard to their returning to pre-aug .
7 positions . " he has never criticised the eu and certainly not on this agreement , " appathurai added . a day after signing last week 's peace accord , moscow said near 8,000 troops would stay in the separatist regions , where considerably fewer of its peacekeepers patrolled under a un mandate before the conflict . nato showing support for georgia the object of the two-day georgia trip by ambassadors from the 26 nato member states will be ongoing talks - insistently backed by the united states - on extending georgia membership in the alliance . despite the urgency now surrounding georgia 's accession talks in the wake of the conflict with russia , nato members are far from decided on further expansion into the former soviet territory . western europe - germany , france , spain and italy - beg to delay inviting georgia and ukraine under its security umbrella , fearing a nightmare scenario in which alliance troops could face off with russian forces in eastern europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer russia and nato froze relations last month , and scheffer , who has been particularly critical of the kremlin over the conflict , said " a speedy revival of the nato-russia council will not be easy . " at the same time , russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov was wrapping up a tour of georgia 's separatist region of abkhazia and south ossetia , underscoring the rift with the west since russia recognized both provinces ' claims to independence . lavrov slammed scheffer 's politics , speaking in the abkhaz capital of sukhumi on sunday . " of course i 've heard the declarations he makes , declarations that are inappropriate for the leader of such a serious organization , " he was quoted by interfax news agency as saying . russia 's top diplomat on monday was due in the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali , where the fighting erupted on aug .
8 . peace accord leaves many in eu unsettled in brussels , the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana affirmed the european union was ready to replace russian troops in georgia with its own civilian observers within the next two weeks . but many in europe have been feeling burned by the rushed peace deal negotiated by french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the eu rotating presidency . vagueness in the accord has allowed moscow to say it provides only for the 200-strong eu mission to deploy in " buffer zones , " effectively giving the eu observers a role of safeguarding the boundaries of georgia 's separatists . those regions are part of georgian territory , the eu has said , but an agreement to tackle the status of the regions in peace talks was also dropped by moscow in the latest pact that provides for peace talks in geneva next month . some russian forces had pulled out from positions deep inside georgia at its black sea port of poti over the weekend in accord with monday 's deadline for the first phase of a withdrawal . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports energy -pipe- 15.09.2008 science edges towards a new generation of biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to biofuels such as ethanol from sugar cane could still help support economies dw-world.de talked to prof. eva-mari aro , an expert on plant physiology and molecular biology at the university of turku in finland , about the current developments in the pursuit of new biofuel technologies . dw-world.de : what are the most viable alternatives to biofuels like ethanol and how do they work ? eva-mari aro : new generation biofuels can be roughly divided into two groups : fuels , which use biomass as a raw material and systems where living organisms -lrb- or biomimicing devices -rrb- produce some liquid fuel , hydrogen or other gas directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide . biomass based biofuels are already close to real application and their breakthrough is mostly dependent on oil price .
however , accumulation of biomass is thermodynamically inefficient process and the conversion of biomass into the form liquid fuel decreases the efficiency more .
biomass has very low efficiency to store energy from sunlight and even in ideal situation they can replace only some percents from fossil fuels .
anyway , they are considered to be a good business when oil prise increases enough . biomass independent systems , in contrast , have very high efficacy in theory , and have real potential to replace fossil fuels .
however , there are still unsolved technical barriers against the real breakthrough of biomass free systems . nowadays ethanol and biodiesel are produced from the same raw materials than food .
this is very inefficient and ethically daunting way for fuel production .
in order to make system more sustainable , the first step is to replace food-based raw materials by more efficient and ethical feedstock .
practically this means organic waste falls , forests and special bioenergy crops and algae . considerable number of research and development is going on in this field .
the idea behind is to convert the biomass into the form of biofuel .
most of the resources are in development of physical , chemical and biochemical processes that can be used to produce biofuels from whatever bulk biomass .
other important area is to explore and develop new plants , which are more suitable for biofuel production as compared to the traditional food crops . agro , forest and oil industry is already involved in developing these systems and they no doubt believe that this will be a business .
indeed , the conversion of bulk biomass into liquid fuels can strongly increase the biofuel production .
however , to be honest , biomass never can replace oil , unless the energy consumption on human population will drop to a fraction of the present one , which will not happen without nuclear war-like catastrophe . the fundamental problem of biomass is that plants store the energy from sunlight into their biomass very inefficiently .
plants are not evolved to be the feedstock of energy production for human activities .
in order to make accumulation of biomass more efficient plants must be pushed to store solar energy many times more efficiently than they do in the nature .
however , plants are so complicated organisms that most probably this will be a mission impossible . as compared to real plants , unicellular algae are simpler and easier to manipulate .
only one type of cell does the all tasks from harvesting the light energy to storage of the energy and for reproduction .
moreover , algae can grow in seawater , which is a great advance when compared to plants . under certain conditions algae can double the biomass in one day and large share of this biomass can be starch or oil , which are easy and energy efficient to convert into form of alcohol or biodiesel .
this means that algae can be much more efficient feedstock for biomass based biofuels than higher plants , particularly for biodiesel formation . the most promising feature of algae is , however , that they can produce molecular hydrogen directly from sunlight and water .
in the nature , this pathway is a kind of emergency valve and function only under very specific conditions .
as such , it has very minor capacity in natural algae .
the existence of this pathway , however , gives a great opportunity to bioscientists to use metabolic engineering in order to make hydrogen production very efficient . what are the benefits of these alternatives ? the main benefit is that there is no competition with food supply .
these alternatives are also very efficient .
in theory , solarbiohydrogen can be a real option for fossil fuels . what effect would the production of these alternatives have on the current production processes of biofuels -lrb- e.g. use of agricultural land , economies in places like brazil , the environment , the alleged contribution to the current food crisis -rrb- ? in general , sunlight is the driving force of the all new systems .
because algae can grow in salt water , the needed water can be pumped from the seas .
when the microalgal solarbiohydrogen systems will be fully developed , indeed , the limiting factor for hydrogen production will be size of bioreactors and availability of solar energy for algal photosynthesis . in present world , there is nearly absolute negative correlation between gdp and high mean daily irradiance .
in the future , when the sunlight will be the main energy source for the need of human beings , the today 's poorest countries will have something that rich countries really are craving .
this means for sure , that new energy business will colonize these poor but very sunny countries in africa and asia . there is no real democracy in these countries , and because of this , there is a risk that the money will flow to the rulers and solar energy money will spread the " middle east " all over central and north africa .
however , if western governments and public organizations monitor the technology transfer , the new energy technology will be a great opportunity to the developing countries . the basic idea of new generation biofuels is not to compete with resources needed to food production .
if in the future the sunny poor countries will be real players in global energy market , it means resources for them .
technology transfer must be linked to the requirements providing that the benefits will be used to modernize the whole society starting from agriculture . would the eu be interested in adopting fuels made from these alternatives or are they focused on ethanol and others ? eu has already a roadmap for a hydrogen economy .
ethanol is not the best solution and the eu knows this .
biodiesel from microalgae is a very attractive option for the eu as well . how easy or hard would it be to produce these alternatives and introduce them into industry and society ? biomass based systems are quite easy .
basically we have the technology , but low energy prices hinder the scaling up of the pilot scale plants .
when the oil price reaches a certain threshold , these technologies will take their part in the energy market . solarbiohydrogen , artificial photosynthesis and other these kinds of more advanced systems are still under development and some fundamental questions need to be solved before commercialisation .
however , the concept is clear and there should n't be anything in this respect that is not possible to solve . what is needed to make the system run is money and smart people .
if industry starts to finance the projects , investments must be a part of their long-term business strategy .
society has to accept genetic manipulation .
in advanced bioenergy field we ca n't do anything without all the tools of modern biotechnology .
anti genetically modified organism -lrb- gmo -rrb- people really should think what the price of banning gmos would be . in general , when massive amounts of hydrogen flow out from bioreactors , everything after that will go fluently .
the transfer from an oil economy to a hydrogen economy is just a set of political decisions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports energy -pipe- 15.09.2008 science edges towards a new generation of biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to biofuels such as ethanol from sugar cane could still help support economies dw-world.de talked to prof. eva-mari aro , an expert on plant physiology and molecular biology at the university of turku in finland , about the current developments in the pursuit of new biofuel technologies . dw-world.de : what are the most viable alternatives to biofuels like ethanol and how do they work ? eva-mari aro : new generation biofuels can be roughly divided into two groups : fuels , which use biomass as a raw material and systems where living organisms -lrb- or biomimicing devices -rrb- produce some liquid fuel , hydrogen or other gas directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide . biomass based biofuels are already close to real application and their breakthrough is mostly dependent on oil price .
however , accumulation of biomass is thermodynamically inefficient process and the conversion of biomass into the form liquid fuel decreases the efficiency more .
biomass has very low efficiency to store energy from sunlight and even in ideal situation they can replace only some percents from fossil fuels .
anyway , they are considered to be a good business when oil prise increases enough . biomass independent systems , in contrast , have very high efficacy in theory , and have real potential to replace fossil fuels .
however , there are still unsolved technical barriers against the real breakthrough of biomass free systems . nowadays ethanol and biodiesel are produced from the same raw materials than food .
this is very inefficient and ethically daunting way for fuel production .
in order to make system more sustainable , the first step is to replace food-based raw materials by more efficient and ethical feedstock .
practically this means organic waste falls , forests and special bioenergy crops and algae . considerable number of research and development is going on in this field .
the idea behind is to convert the biomass into the form of biofuel .
most of the resources are in development of physical , chemical and biochemical processes that can be used to produce biofuels from whatever bulk biomass .
other important area is to explore and develop new plants , which are more suitable for biofuel production as compared to the traditional food crops . agro , forest and oil industry is already involved in developing these systems and they no doubt believe that this will be a business .
indeed , the conversion of bulk biomass into liquid fuels can strongly increase the biofuel production .
however , to be honest , biomass never can replace oil , unless the energy consumption on human population will drop to a fraction of the present one , which will not happen without nuclear war-like catastrophe . the fundamental problem of biomass is that plants store the energy from sunlight into their biomass very inefficiently .
plants are not evolved to be the feedstock of energy production for human activities .
in order to make accumulation of biomass more efficient plants must be pushed to store solar energy many times more efficiently than they do in the nature .
however , plants are so complicated organisms that most probably this will be a mission impossible . as compared to real plants , unicellular algae are simpler and easier to manipulate .
only one type of cell does the all tasks from harvesting the light energy to storage of the energy and for reproduction .
moreover , algae can grow in seawater , which is a great advance when compared to plants . under certain conditions algae can double the biomass in one day and large share of this biomass can be starch or oil , which are easy and energy efficient to convert into form of alcohol or biodiesel .
this means that algae can be much more efficient feedstock for biomass based biofuels than higher plants , particularly for biodiesel formation . the most promising feature of algae is , however , that they can produce molecular hydrogen directly from sunlight and water .
in the nature , this pathway is a kind of emergency valve and function only under very specific conditions .
as such , it has very minor capacity in natural algae .
the existence of this pathway , however , gives a great opportunity to bioscientists to use metabolic engineering in order to make hydrogen production very efficient . what are the benefits of these alternatives ? the main benefit is that there is no competition with food supply .
these alternatives are also very efficient .
in theory , solarbiohydrogen can be a real option for fossil fuels . what effect would the production of these alternatives have on the current production processes of biofuels -lrb- e.g. use of agricultural land , economies in places like brazil , the environment , the alleged contribution to the current food crisis -rrb- ? in general , sunlight is the driving force of the all new systems .
because algae can grow in salt water , the needed water can be pumped from the seas .
when the microalgal solarbiohydrogen systems will be fully developed , indeed , the limiting factor for hydrogen production will be size of bioreactors and availability of solar energy for algal photosynthesis . in present world , there is nearly absolute negative correlation between gdp and high mean daily irradiance .
in the future , when the sunlight will be the main energy source for the need of human beings , the today 's poorest countries will have something that rich countries really are craving .
this means for sure , that new energy business will colonize these poor but very sunny countries in africa and asia . there is no real democracy in these countries , and because of this , there is a risk that the money will flow to the rulers and solar energy money will spread the " middle east " all over central and north africa .

german prosecutors in munich are expected to present many of the same documents and witnesses who described at the italy trial how the germans shot three men and a woman on the first day of the reprisal .
the next day , 11 males were locked inside the ground floor of the home of a villager , ferdinando cannicci , and it was blown up .

two germans were killed without warning , but the third man got away only slightly wounded and told his fellow engineers .
the company 's lieutenant and his superior , a major in charge of the whole battalion , allegedly decided the engineers should mount a reprisal on the hamlet , which is in the hills making up the " backbone " of the italian peninsula between siena and perugia .
members of company 1 shot up the area , with a german anti-aircraft unit firing over it to scare off partisans .
four people , including a 74-year-old woman , were shot dead purely because they got in the way of the rampage .
later , the italians were forced to watch as charges were placed under their homes in the hamlet and they were blown up .
the men aged 16 to 66 were herded into one house and it was dynamited .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.09.2008 euro-zone workers seek pay hikes amid inflation fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions claim workers have n't gotten their share of recent growth calls for pay restraint as major european economies slip into recession are falling on deaf ears , with workers in numerous countries grumbling that they have gained few of the promised fruits of the last upswing . earlier in september , european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet hammered out a warning against " second-round effects in price and wage setting , " telling euro-zone citizens to put up with high world prices for fuel and food which are beyond governments ' control .
metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .
similar impatience in the working and middle classes amid perceptions that they are slipping back has emerged in britain .
rallies for " fair " pay the labour government 's determination to restrain pay for public-sector workers will be challenged this autumn by teachers and civil servants , who say they are no longer prepared to live on wages eaten up by rising costs for food and fuel .
so far , prime minister gordon brown has argued that low wage demands over the past few years have contributed to economic growth and stability , low unemployment and a rise in living standards .
but after biting the bullet for most of the last 11 years of labour rule , and facing additional challenges from the global economic downturn and the credit crunch , the trade unions are no longer prepared to toe the line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are split on whether higher wages will lead to a wage-price spiral the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- voted this month for " days of action " this autumn in support of higher wages .
rather than strikes , there will be rallies and street protests for " fair pay . "
the tuc could no longer tolerate a sharp drop in living standards for members while the pay packets of bosses were going up by 20 or 30 percent , tuc secretary-general brendan barber said .
warning against pay hikes norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , said in an interview that the danger from pay hikes was real .
if pay were to rise sharply , " the outcome will be inflationary effects in the short term and probably a weakening in growth . "
" pay negotiators do not seem to realize that the terms of trade for nations that import energy and food have worsened , " he said .
declining terms of trade mean that a nation 's imports become more expensive in comparison to its exports .
walter said the ecb would not have had to keep its interest rates so high " if we had intelligent players " who understood that big picture .
earn more , spend more the opposing view comes from claus schaefer , an economist at germany 's trade-union think-tank wsi in dusseldorf , who studies how germans share their economic cake .
it was precisely because the world economy was weak that germans needed to earn more and spend more .
" domestic demand can ease the effects of an economic slowing and make a stabilizing contribution during the slowdown phase , " he said in an interview .
" in germany and in other eu nations we have had a very restrained incomes policy .
profits have risen sharply , but wages have stagnated in nominal terms and actually fallen in real terms , " schaefer said .
current pay claims were " a small correction to past inequalities . "
he dismissed fears of a wage-price spiral , which he said had only been seen in post-war germany in the late 1960s and the early 1980s .
deutsche bank 's walter disagreed , saying that boosting domestic demand in times of trouble is only helpful in low-debt economies .
but germany had high public debt and was struggling to provide for an ageing society .
" we have already eaten up our future at breakfast time , " he said .
inflation fears rise in eastern europe in eastern european nations , where the post-1989 change from communism to private enterprise has brought prosperity to many , fears have also been growing among labor groups that inflation will eat up the gains .
tough labor talks are expected in the czech republic this autumn as public and private-sector unions seek an 8-percent pay rise for 2009 .
the czech chamber of commerce called the demand unrealistic .
koruna inflation cut real wage growth to 1.1 percent in the second quarter of 2008 , the lowest in 10 years .
a recent study found poles were earning more and have better job security , but the benefits of a stronger zloty have not helped all .
the solidarity union recently brought out at least 18,000 marchers for poland 's largest labor protest in years .
organizers displayed shopping carts with a few basic staples , saying the items were all a minimum-wage worker or retiree could afford .
labor rumblings have also been growing in the baltic nations as their years of boom fade .
latvia 's government has said it will freeze public-sector wages in 2009 , prompting union threats of labor action and calls for the government to resign . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu ministers vow unified approach to downturn europe will not repeat the mistakes of the past and spend its way out of a recession , eurozone finance ministers said as they rejected calls for a us-style stimulus package to combat the continent 's economic slowdown .

metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .
similar impatience in the working and middle classes amid perceptions that they are slipping back has emerged in britain .
rallies for " fair " pay the labour government 's determination to restrain pay for public-sector workers will be challenged this autumn by teachers and civil servants , who say they are no longer prepared to live on wages eaten up by rising costs for food and fuel .
so far , prime minister gordon brown has argued that low wage demands over the past few years have contributed to economic growth and stability , low unemployment and a rise in living standards .
but after biting the bullet for most of the last 11 years of labour rule , and facing additional challenges from the global economic downturn and the credit crunch , the trade unions are no longer prepared to toe the line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are split on whether higher wages will lead to a wage-price spiral the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- voted this month for " days of action " this autumn in support of higher wages .
rather than strikes , there will be rallies and street protests for " fair pay . "
the tuc could no longer tolerate a sharp drop in living standards for members while the pay packets of bosses were going up by 20 or 30 percent , tuc secretary-general brendan barber said .
warning against pay hikes norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , said in an interview that the danger from pay hikes was real .
if pay were to rise sharply , " the outcome will be inflationary effects in the short term and probably a weakening in growth . "
" pay negotiators do not seem to realize that the terms of trade for nations that import energy and food have worsened , " he said .
declining terms of trade mean that a nation 's imports become more expensive in comparison to its exports .
walter said the ecb would not have had to keep its interest rates so high " if we had intelligent players " who understood that big picture .
earn more , spend more the opposing view comes from claus schaefer , an economist at germany 's trade-union think-tank wsi in dusseldorf , who studies how germans share their economic cake .
it was precisely because the world economy was weak that germans needed to earn more and spend more .
" domestic demand can ease the effects of an economic slowing and make a stabilizing contribution during the slowdown phase , " he said in an interview .
" in germany and in other eu nations we have had a very restrained incomes policy .
profits have risen sharply , but wages have stagnated in nominal terms and actually fallen in real terms , " schaefer said .
current pay claims were " a small correction to past inequalities . "
he dismissed fears of a wage-price spiral , which he said had only been seen in post-war germany in the late 1960s and the early 1980s .
deutsche bank 's walter disagreed , saying that boosting domestic demand in times of trouble is only helpful in low-debt economies .
but germany had high public debt and was struggling to provide for an ageing society .
" we have already eaten up our future at breakfast time , " he said .
inflation fears rise in eastern europe in eastern european nations , where the post-1989 change from communism to private enterprise has brought prosperity to many , fears have also been growing among labor groups that inflation will eat up the gains .
tough labor talks are expected in the czech republic this autumn as public and private-sector unions seek an 8-percent pay rise for 2009 .
the czech chamber of commerce called the demand unrealistic .

metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .
similar impatience in the working and middle classes amid perceptions that they are slipping back has emerged in britain .
rallies for " fair " pay the labour government 's determination to restrain pay for public-sector workers will be challenged this autumn by teachers and civil servants , who say they are no longer prepared to live on wages eaten up by rising costs for food and fuel .
so far , prime minister gordon brown has argued that low wage demands over the past few years have contributed to economic growth and stability , low unemployment and a rise in living standards .
but after biting the bullet for most of the last 11 years of labour rule , and facing additional challenges from the global economic downturn and the credit crunch , the trade unions are no longer prepared to toe the line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are split on whether higher wages will lead to a wage-price spiral the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- voted this month for " days of action " this autumn in support of higher wages .
rather than strikes , there will be rallies and street protests for " fair pay . "
the tuc could no longer tolerate a sharp drop in living standards for members while the pay packets of bosses were going up by 20 or 30 percent , tuc secretary-general brendan barber said .
warning against pay hikes norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , said in an interview that the danger from pay hikes was real .
if pay were to rise sharply , " the outcome will be inflationary effects in the short term and probably a weakening in growth . "
" pay negotiators do not seem to realize that the terms of trade for nations that import energy and food have worsened , " he said .
declining terms of trade mean that a nation 's imports become more expensive in comparison to its exports .
walter said the ecb would not have had to keep its interest rates so high " if we had intelligent players " who understood that big picture .

the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : biofuels : a bright new dawn or a cloudy future ?
new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports energy -pipe- 15.09.2008 science edges towards a new generation of biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to biofuels such as ethanol from sugar cane could still help support economies dw-world.de talked to prof. eva-mari aro , an expert on plant physiology and molecular biology at the university of turku in finland , about the current developments in the pursuit of new biofuel technologies . dw-world.de : what are the most viable alternatives to biofuels like ethanol and how do they work ? eva-mari aro : new generation biofuels can be roughly divided into two groups : fuels , which use biomass as a raw material and systems where living organisms -lrb- or biomimicing devices -rrb- produce some liquid fuel , hydrogen or other gas directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide . biomass based biofuels are already close to real application and their breakthrough is mostly dependent on oil price .
however , accumulation of biomass is thermodynamically inefficient process and the conversion of biomass into the form liquid fuel decreases the efficiency more .
biomass has very low efficiency to store energy from sunlight and even in ideal situation they can replace only some percents from fossil fuels .
anyway , they are considered to be a good business when oil prise increases enough . biomass independent systems , in contrast , have very high efficacy in theory , and have real potential to replace fossil fuels .
however , there are still unsolved technical barriers against the real breakthrough of biomass free systems . nowadays ethanol and biodiesel are produced from the same raw materials than food .
this is very inefficient and ethically daunting way for fuel production .
in order to make system more sustainable , the first step is to replace food-based raw materials by more efficient and ethical feedstock .
practically this means organic waste falls , forests and special bioenergy crops and algae . considerable number of research and development is going on in this field .
the idea behind is to convert the biomass into the form of biofuel .
most of the resources are in development of physical , chemical and biochemical processes that can be used to produce biofuels from whatever bulk biomass .
other important area is to explore and develop new plants , which are more suitable for biofuel production as compared to the traditional food crops . agro , forest and oil industry is already involved in developing these systems and they no doubt believe that this will be a business .
indeed , the conversion of bulk biomass into liquid fuels can strongly increase the biofuel production .
however , to be honest , biomass never can replace oil , unless the energy consumption on human population will drop to a fraction of the present one , which will not happen without nuclear war-like catastrophe . the fundamental problem of biomass is that plants store the energy from sunlight into their biomass very inefficiently .
plants are not evolved to be the feedstock of energy production for human activities .
in order to make accumulation of biomass more efficient plants must be pushed to store solar energy many times more efficiently than they do in the nature .
however , plants are so complicated organisms that most probably this will be a mission impossible . as compared to real plants , unicellular algae are simpler and easier to manipulate .
only one type of cell does the all tasks from harvesting the light energy to storage of the energy and for reproduction .
moreover , algae can grow in seawater , which is a great advance when compared to plants . under certain conditions algae can double the biomass in one day and large share of this biomass can be starch or oil , which are easy and energy efficient to convert into form of alcohol or biodiesel .
this means that algae can be much more efficient feedstock for biomass based biofuels than higher plants , particularly for biodiesel formation . the most promising feature of algae is , however , that they can produce molecular hydrogen directly from sunlight and water .
in the nature , this pathway is a kind of emergency valve and function only under very specific conditions .
as such , it has very minor capacity in natural algae .
the existence of this pathway , however , gives a great opportunity to bioscientists to use metabolic engineering in order to make hydrogen production very efficient . what are the benefits of these alternatives ? the main benefit is that there is no competition with food supply .
these alternatives are also very efficient .
in theory , solarbiohydrogen can be a real option for fossil fuels . what effect would the production of these alternatives have on the current production processes of biofuels -lrb- e.g. use of agricultural land , economies in places like brazil , the environment , the alleged contribution to the current food crisis -rrb- ? in general , sunlight is the driving force of the all new systems .
because algae can grow in salt water , the needed water can be pumped from the seas .
when the microalgal solarbiohydrogen systems will be fully developed , indeed , the limiting factor for hydrogen production will be size of bioreactors and availability of solar energy for algal photosynthesis . in present world , there is nearly absolute negative correlation between gdp and high mean daily irradiance .
in the future , when the sunlight will be the main energy source for the need of human beings , the today 's poorest countries will have something that rich countries really are craving .
this means for sure , that new energy business will colonize these poor but very sunny countries in africa and asia . there is no real democracy in these countries , and because of this , there is a risk that the money will flow to the rulers and solar energy money will spread the " middle east " all over central and north africa .
however , if western governments and public organizations monitor the technology transfer , the new energy technology will be a great opportunity to the developing countries . the basic idea of new generation biofuels is not to compete with resources needed to food production .
if in the future the sunny poor countries will be real players in global energy market , it means resources for them .
technology transfer must be linked to the requirements providing that the benefits will be used to modernize the whole society starting from agriculture . would the eu be interested in adopting fuels made from these alternatives or are they focused on ethanol and others ? eu has already a roadmap for a hydrogen economy .
ethanol is not the best solution and the eu knows this .
biodiesel from microalgae is a very attractive option for the eu as well . how easy or hard would it be to produce these alternatives and introduce them into industry and society ? biomass based systems are quite easy .
basically we have the technology , but low energy prices hinder the scaling up of the pilot scale plants .
when the oil price reaches a certain threshold , these technologies will take their part in the energy market . solarbiohydrogen , artificial photosynthesis and other these kinds of more advanced systems are still under development and some fundamental questions need to be solved before commercialisation .
however , the concept is clear and there should n't be anything in this respect that is not possible to solve . what is needed to make the system run is money and smart people .
if industry starts to finance the projects , investments must be a part of their long-term business strategy .
society has to accept genetic manipulation .
in advanced bioenergy field we ca n't do anything without all the tools of modern biotechnology .
anti genetically modified organism -lrb- gmo -rrb- people really should think what the price of banning gmos would be . in general , when massive amounts of hydrogen flow out from bioreactors , everything after that will go fluently .
the transfer from an oil economy to a hydrogen economy is just a set of political decisions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.09.2008 opinion : american banks lose more than just money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choked by the credit crisis , lehman brothers , the 158-year-old us investment bank , has filed for bankruptcy .
the crisis underscores how banks have squandered their most prized asset - trust - says dw 's karl zawadzky . trust is the beginning of everything .
and now , mistrust is the end of everything .
this was illustrated dramatically by events on wall street on monday .
trust in the stability of large american banks has evaporated , and mistrust now reigns on wall street as well as in financial districts in london , frankfurt and tokyo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking crisis has now claimed lehman brothers , america 's fourth-largest investment bank .
the institute was founded 158 years ago by german immigrants and recently has posted billion-strong losses quarter after quarter .
in the second quarter of this year , the institution registered a record loss of $ 4 million .
the frantic search for a new cash injection turned out to be in vain . on sunday night , the bank 's management had no choice but to file for chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy filing ever .
that has won the bank a little time to find fresh funds or perhaps to be taken under the wings of another large bank . if that does n't work out , liquidation of a once strong and proud bank is certain .
america 's third-largest investment bank , merrill lynch , has found a savior for now with the bank of america taking over the stricken institution . the shockwaves from reeling us financial markets has pushed global share markets into the red .
there remains no doubt that the international banking crisis has reached a new danger level .
the us government and the federal reserve are no longer prepared to take responsibility for the mistakes of private banks . six months ago , they facilitated the emergency sale of the comparatively small investment bank bear stearns to the financial institution j.p. morgan chase with a massive loan .
they also bailed out mortgage banks fannie mae and freddie mac with the staggering sum of $ 5 trillion .
but now apparently it 's the end of state bailouts or maybe the american state has reached the limits of its financial largesse .
after all , this is about a lot of money . lehman brothers has debts worth $ 613 billion .
of course , the government and the federal reserve will try to avoid a domino effect .
but first it 's up to the private financial sector to step in - not with words but with money .
ten leading international banks , including germany 's deutsche bank , are pooling in $ 70 billion in a fund to help each other with possible cash crunches . lehman brothers , a renowned traditional bank , is in a tailspin .
without a large investor - with really deep pockets - the end of the bank is nigh .
the bank first squandered away its billions and then fell victim to the raging mistrust in financial markets . lehman is n't the first bank to suffer this fate and probably wo n't be the last .
the current banking crisis is the result of too much cheap federal reserve money , endless greed and overly generous banking supervision .
that explains the mistakes and extremes rife in the current financial disaster . germany is also affected by it .
german banks have irresponsibly speculated with bad american mortgages .
but in america , the crisis has a whole new dimension .
the result is n't just a financial disaster but also a political scandal . after the profits have been privatized , the losses are now being nationalized .
even if governments and federal reserves do n't stand by threatened banks , the banking crisis emanating from the us has squeezed the world economy . everybody is paying a price for the wrong acts of some .
in this context , calls for a stronger regulation of the financial sector are understandable .
banks have simply squandered trust .
but let 's not forget that it 's not money but rather the trust of investors and customers that is the most prized asset of banks .
that asset has been severely abused . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de after lehman , expert calls for framework on bank bailouts us banking giant lehman brothers is filing for bankruptcy , the latest us lender to bow to the pressures of the subprime mortgage crisis .
more losses are likely , a german economist told dw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.09.2008 opinion : american banks lose more than just money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choked by the credit crisis , lehman brothers , the 158-year-old us investment bank , has filed for bankruptcy .
the crisis underscores how banks have squandered their most prized asset - trust - says dw 's karl zawadzky . trust is the beginning of everything .
and now , mistrust is the end of everything .
this was illustrated dramatically by events on wall street on monday .
trust in the stability of large american banks has evaporated , and mistrust now reigns on wall street as well as in financial districts in london , frankfurt and tokyo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking crisis has now claimed lehman brothers , america 's fourth-largest investment bank .
the institute was founded 158 years ago by german immigrants and recently has posted billion-strong losses quarter after quarter .
in the second quarter of this year , the institution registered a record loss of $ 4 million .
the frantic search for a new cash injection turned out to be in vain . on sunday night , the bank 's management had no choice but to file for chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy filing ever .
that has won the bank a little time to find fresh funds or perhaps to be taken under the wings of another large bank . if that does n't work out , liquidation of a once strong and proud bank is certain .
america 's third-largest investment bank , merrill lynch , has found a savior for now with the bank of america taking over the stricken institution . the shockwaves from reeling us financial markets has pushed global share markets into the red .
there remains no doubt that the international banking crisis has reached a new danger level .
the us government and the federal reserve are no longer prepared to take responsibility for the mistakes of private banks . six months ago , they facilitated the emergency sale of the comparatively small investment bank bear stearns to the financial institution j.p. morgan chase with a massive loan .
they also bailed out mortgage banks fannie mae and freddie mac with the staggering sum of $ 5 trillion .
but now apparently it 's the end of state bailouts or maybe the american state has reached the limits of its financial largesse .
after all , this is about a lot of money . lehman brothers has debts worth $ 613 billion .
of course , the government and the federal reserve will try to avoid a domino effect .
but first it 's up to the private financial sector to step in - not with words but with money .
ten leading international banks , including germany 's deutsche bank , are pooling in $ 70 billion in a fund to help each other with possible cash crunches . lehman brothers , a renowned traditional bank , is in a tailspin .
without a large investor - with really deep pockets - the end of the bank is nigh .
the bank first squandered away its billions and then fell victim to the raging mistrust in financial markets . lehman is n't the first bank to suffer this fate and probably wo n't be the last .
the current banking crisis is the result of too much cheap federal reserve money , endless greed and overly generous banking supervision .
that explains the mistakes and extremes rife in the current financial disaster . germany is also affected by it .
german banks have irresponsibly speculated with bad american mortgages .
but in america , the crisis has a whole new dimension .
the result is n't just a financial disaster but also a political scandal . after the profits have been privatized , the losses are now being nationalized .
even if governments and federal reserves do n't stand by threatened banks , the banking crisis emanating from the us has squeezed the world economy . everybody is paying a price for the wrong acts of some .
in this context , calls for a stronger regulation of the financial sector are understandable .
banks have simply squandered trust .
but let 's not forget that it 's not money but rather the trust of investors and customers that is the most prized asset of banks .
that asset has been severely abused . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de after lehman , expert calls for framework on bank bailouts us banking giant lehman brothers is filing for bankruptcy , the latest us lender to bow to the pressures of the subprime mortgage crisis .
more losses are likely , a german economist told dw .

lehman does n't have much systemic risk , or risk with a high probability that it will pull down other banks in its wake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 15.09.2008 german denies world war ii atrocity in italy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's regional court is hosting what may be the world 's last nazi war crimes trial a 90-year-old former lieutenant in nazi germany 's forces , on trial in munich for leading a murderous reprisal that killed 14 civilians in italy in 1944 , has denied he was involved in the crime . josef scheungraber , the former commander of a german mountain infantry battalion , is accused of ordering the killing of 14 civilians in the tuscan village of falzano on june 26 , 1944 . the massacre was allegedly in retaliation for an attack by italian partisans that left two german soldiers dead . but in a trial in munich on monday , sept 15 , scheungraber denied having carried out the killings . the accused " completely and thoroughly denies the accusations in the charge sheet , " said a statement read in court by one of his two lawyers , christian stuenkel . no-extradition rule negates sentence munich daily sueddeutsche zeitung said monday that scheungraber 's prosecution in germany " is possibly - and even probably - the last major trial for crimes committed under the nazis . " a handful of protesters gathered outside the courtroom holding a placard reading " mass murderer here !
give the murdered a name . " the former lieutenant has already been convicted once in absentia in la spezia , italy , by an italian military court of directing the june 26-27 , 1944 , atrocity at falzano , a hamlet in tuscany .
the life imprisonment sentence , handed down in september 2006 , can not be enforced because germany does not extradite its own citizens .
german prosecutors in munich are expected to present many of the same documents and witnesses who described at the italy trial how the germans shot three men and a woman on the first day of the reprisal .
the next day , 11 males were locked inside the ground floor of the home of a villager , ferdinando cannicci , and it was blown up .
only a teenager , cannicci , now 79 , survived and he is one of the few eyewitnesses still alive today .
two decades as a town councilor scheungraber lived in ottobrunn , a munich suburb , after world war ii and was a town councilor for two decades as well as honorary fire-brigade chief .
at italy 's request , german police interviewed him before the la spezia trial .
he confirmed he had been an officer of company 1 , battalion 818 of the mountain combat engineers in italy , but denied the atrocity .
the indictment describes how company 1 was near falzano to hold up advancing allied forces as the germans withdrew from italy in 1944 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will justice be served ?
field marshal albert kesselring had ordered brutal reprisals to be conducted on italians if german troops were harmed .
ambush leads to reprisals on june 26 , partisans ambushed a three-man german patrol as it was about to requisition a horse in falzano .
two germans were killed without warning , but the third man got away only slightly wounded and told his fellow engineers .
the company 's lieutenant and his superior , a major in charge of the whole battalion , allegedly decided the engineers should mount a reprisal on the hamlet , which is in the hills making up the " backbone " of the italian peninsula between siena and perugia .
members of company 1 shot up the area , with a german anti-aircraft unit firing over it to scare off partisans .
four people , including a 74-year-old woman , were shot dead purely because they got in the way of the rampage .
later , the italians were forced to watch as charges were placed under their homes in the hamlet and they were blown up .
the men aged 16 to 66 were herded into one house and it was dynamited .
22 witnesses are called in munich , scheungraber is charged with 14 counts of murder with a base motive and the court has set down 11 hearing days up to oct .
21 .
it is likely to be a slow trial : the evidence is old , and hearing days are usually kept short in germany when the accused are elderly .
in total , 22 witnesses and three experts have been summoned .
the first issue will be to decide if the former lieutenant is fit to stand trial .
his former superior has already been ruled too frail to try .
munich lawyers said that the accused 's three-man defense team includes klaus goebel , who some reports link to a charity , the stille hilfe -lrb- silent aid -rrb- , that offered legal and other aid to nazis after the war .
trial lawyer goebel 's earlier clients have included ernst zuendel , who has been convicted of denying the holocaust , and the late anton malloth , who was jailed for life in 2001 on two counts of murder committed in nazi concentration camps . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the life imprisonment sentence , handed down in september 2006 , can not be enforced because germany does not extradite its own citizens .
german prosecutors in munich are expected to present many of the same documents and witnesses who described at the italy trial how the germans shot three men and a woman on the first day of the reprisal .
the next day , 11 males were locked inside the ground floor of the home of a villager , ferdinando cannicci , and it was blown up .

field marshal albert kesselring had ordered brutal reprisals to be conducted on italians if german troops were harmed .
ambush leads to reprisals on june 26 , partisans ambushed a three-man german patrol as it was about to requisition a horse in falzano .
two germans were killed without warning , but the third man got away only slightly wounded and told his fellow engineers .
the company 's lieutenant and his superior , a major in charge of the whole battalion , allegedly decided the engineers should mount a reprisal on the hamlet , which is in the hills making up the " backbone " of the italian peninsula between siena and perugia .
members of company 1 shot up the area , with a german anti-aircraft unit firing over it to scare off partisans .
four people , including a 74-year-old woman , were shot dead purely because they got in the way of the rampage .
later , the italians were forced to watch as charges were placed under their homes in the hamlet and they were blown up .
the men aged 16 to 66 were herded into one house and it was dynamited .
22 witnesses are called in munich , scheungraber is charged with 14 counts of murder with a base motive and the court has set down 11 hearing days up to oct .
21 .
it is likely to be a slow trial : the evidence is old , and hearing days are usually kept short in germany when the accused are elderly .
in total , 22 witnesses and three experts have been summoned .
the first issue will be to decide if the former lieutenant is fit to stand trial .
his former superior has already been ruled too frail to try .
munich lawyers said that the accused 's three-man defense team includes klaus goebel , who some reports link to a charity , the stille hilfe -lrb- silent aid -rrb- , that offered legal and other aid to nazis after the war .

more losses are likely , a german economist told dw . dr. michael schroeder is the head of the department of international finance and financial management at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , a non-profit economic research institute in mannheim , germany . deutsche welle : dr. schroeder , how will lehman 's collapse affect europe ? michael schroeder : that question is difficult to answer .
lehman does n't have much systemic risk , or risk with a high probability that it will pull down other banks in its wake .
so i do n't expect the direct counterparts in the banking sector will be hit very strongly . but it is a signal that much greater-than-expected problems in the banking sector are yet to come .
some experts thought one or two months ago that the worse of the subprime crisis was over .
but as we see in the news , this is not the case .
it was very optimistic . world stock markets dropped sharply at the lehman bankruptcy news .
why does the failure of one us bank have such far-reaching financial effects ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says more problems are yet to come i think it has to do with the fact that there still very high losses to come in the near future .
we see that hedge funds , or so-called monoline insurance companies , or other banking institutions could go bankrupt or near-bankrupt by the end of the year - particularly in the us but also perhaps in europe , due to collateral damage in the sector . the expectations are now that high losses could come in the next two or three months .
this will also hurt the business cycle in europe .
but it is difficult to predict to how great an extent ; how strong the impact will be . should consumers in germany be concerned ? well , yes , german consumers should be concerned because the business cycle will be relatively weak over the next year .
but the consumers themselves are part of the problem .
the economy gets weaker , they become more risk averse , then they consume less , and it drives the cycle downwards . ...
germans should consumer more , to combat this cycle . the us government opted not to bail out lehman .
yet the german government recently went to the aid of the ikb bank , when that lender nearly collapsed in the wake of the subprime crisis ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billions of euros were spent bailing out the ikb bank i think bailing out banks or companies has a lot to do with so-called systemic risks .
i do not expect that lehman really will have a strong effect on other banks or banking systems … so the us was right for not bailing out lehman brothers , in my opinion . i also did n't understand why the german government bailed out ikb .
in my opinion it was absolutely unnecessary , and it imposes relatively high costs to the taxpayers in germany . one us analyst is comparing this monday to a certain black monday back in 1929 .
is that realistic ? that is absolutely exaggerated ...
i do n't believe we have an unmanageable , or even an extremely strong , crisis right now .
the stock markets and all the other markets have reacted realistically . there are , of course , very high losses .
but it is not a catastrophe . is there a lesson to draw from this turn of events ? we need a new framework for the banking industry that should be instituted when this crisis is over .
we need clear rules that say when to bail out and when not to bail out a company . politicians should make it clear that banks can go bankrupt . ...
there are many medium size banks that should be allowed to go bankrupt when they have no liquidity anymore . we also need to have a framework for how it should be handled when a bank is bailed out .
managers should n't be allowed to get away with being extremely risk-loving and then not have to pay the price if that strategy fails . when the economy absorbs losses it should be clear who has to pay for these losses .

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports energy -pipe- 15.09.2008 science edges towards a new generation of biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to biofuels such as ethanol from sugar cane could still help support economies dw-world.de talked to prof. eva-mari aro , an expert on plant physiology and molecular biology at the university of turku in finland , about the current developments in the pursuit of new biofuel technologies . dw-world.de : what are the most viable alternatives to biofuels like ethanol and how do they work ? eva-mari aro : new generation biofuels can be roughly divided into two groups : fuels , which use biomass as a raw material and systems where living organisms -lrb- or biomimicing devices -rrb- produce some liquid fuel , hydrogen or other gas directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide . biomass based biofuels are already close to real application and their breakthrough is mostly dependent on oil price .
however , accumulation of biomass is thermodynamically inefficient process and the conversion of biomass into the form liquid fuel decreases the efficiency more .
biomass has very low efficiency to store energy from sunlight and even in ideal situation they can replace only some percents from fossil fuels .
anyway , they are considered to be a good business when oil prise increases enough . biomass independent systems , in contrast , have very high efficacy in theory , and have real potential to replace fossil fuels .
however , there are still unsolved technical barriers against the real breakthrough of biomass free systems . nowadays ethanol and biodiesel are produced from the same raw materials than food .
this is very inefficient and ethically daunting way for fuel production .
in order to make system more sustainable , the first step is to replace food-based raw materials by more efficient and ethical feedstock .
practically this means organic waste falls , forests and special bioenergy crops and algae . considerable number of research and development is going on in this field .
the idea behind is to convert the biomass into the form of biofuel .
most of the resources are in development of physical , chemical and biochemical processes that can be used to produce biofuels from whatever bulk biomass .
other important area is to explore and develop new plants , which are more suitable for biofuel production as compared to the traditional food crops . agro , forest and oil industry is already involved in developing these systems and they no doubt believe that this will be a business .
indeed , the conversion of bulk biomass into liquid fuels can strongly increase the biofuel production .
however , to be honest , biomass never can replace oil , unless the energy consumption on human population will drop to a fraction of the present one , which will not happen without nuclear war-like catastrophe . the fundamental problem of biomass is that plants store the energy from sunlight into their biomass very inefficiently .
plants are not evolved to be the feedstock of energy production for human activities .
in order to make accumulation of biomass more efficient plants must be pushed to store solar energy many times more efficiently than they do in the nature .
however , plants are so complicated organisms that most probably this will be a mission impossible . as compared to real plants , unicellular algae are simpler and easier to manipulate .
only one type of cell does the all tasks from harvesting the light energy to storage of the energy and for reproduction .
moreover , algae can grow in seawater , which is a great advance when compared to plants . under certain conditions algae can double the biomass in one day and large share of this biomass can be starch or oil , which are easy and energy efficient to convert into form of alcohol or biodiesel .
this means that algae can be much more efficient feedstock for biomass based biofuels than higher plants , particularly for biodiesel formation . the most promising feature of algae is , however , that they can produce molecular hydrogen directly from sunlight and water .
in the nature , this pathway is a kind of emergency valve and function only under very specific conditions .
as such , it has very minor capacity in natural algae .
the existence of this pathway , however , gives a great opportunity to bioscientists to use metabolic engineering in order to make hydrogen production very efficient . what are the benefits of these alternatives ? the main benefit is that there is no competition with food supply .
these alternatives are also very efficient .
in theory , solarbiohydrogen can be a real option for fossil fuels . what effect would the production of these alternatives have on the current production processes of biofuels -lrb- e.g. use of agricultural land , economies in places like brazil , the environment , the alleged contribution to the current food crisis -rrb- ? in general , sunlight is the driving force of the all new systems .
because algae can grow in salt water , the needed water can be pumped from the seas .
when the microalgal solarbiohydrogen systems will be fully developed , indeed , the limiting factor for hydrogen production will be size of bioreactors and availability of solar energy for algal photosynthesis . in present world , there is nearly absolute negative correlation between gdp and high mean daily irradiance .
in the future , when the sunlight will be the main energy source for the need of human beings , the today 's poorest countries will have something that rich countries really are craving .
this means for sure , that new energy business will colonize these poor but very sunny countries in africa and asia . there is no real democracy in these countries , and because of this , there is a risk that the money will flow to the rulers and solar energy money will spread the " middle east " all over central and north africa .
however , if western governments and public organizations monitor the technology transfer , the new energy technology will be a great opportunity to the developing countries . the basic idea of new generation biofuels is not to compete with resources needed to food production .
if in the future the sunny poor countries will be real players in global energy market , it means resources for them .
technology transfer must be linked to the requirements providing that the benefits will be used to modernize the whole society starting from agriculture . would the eu be interested in adopting fuels made from these alternatives or are they focused on ethanol and others ? eu has already a roadmap for a hydrogen economy .
ethanol is not the best solution and the eu knows this .
biodiesel from microalgae is a very attractive option for the eu as well . how easy or hard would it be to produce these alternatives and introduce them into industry and society ? biomass based systems are quite easy .
basically we have the technology , but low energy prices hinder the scaling up of the pilot scale plants .
when the oil price reaches a certain threshold , these technologies will take their part in the energy market . solarbiohydrogen , artificial photosynthesis and other these kinds of more advanced systems are still under development and some fundamental questions need to be solved before commercialisation .
however , the concept is clear and there should n't be anything in this respect that is not possible to solve . what is needed to make the system run is money and smart people .
if industry starts to finance the projects , investments must be a part of their long-term business strategy .
society has to accept genetic manipulation .
in advanced bioenergy field we ca n't do anything without all the tools of modern biotechnology .
anti genetically modified organism -lrb- gmo -rrb- people really should think what the price of banning gmos would be . in general , when massive amounts of hydrogen flow out from bioreactors , everything after that will go fluently .
the transfer from an oil economy to a hydrogen economy is just a set of political decisions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , to be honest , biomass never can replace oil , unless the energy consumption on human population will drop to a fraction of the present one , which will not happen without nuclear war-like catastrophe . the fundamental problem of biomass is that plants store the energy from sunlight into their biomass very inefficiently .
plants are not evolved to be the feedstock of energy production for human activities .
in order to make accumulation of biomass more efficient plants must be pushed to store solar energy many times more efficiently than they do in the nature .
however , plants are so complicated organisms that most probably this will be a mission impossible . as compared to real plants , unicellular algae are simpler and easier to manipulate .
only one type of cell does the all tasks from harvesting the light energy to storage of the energy and for reproduction .
moreover , algae can grow in seawater , which is a great advance when compared to plants . under certain conditions algae can double the biomass in one day and large share of this biomass can be starch or oil , which are easy and energy efficient to convert into form of alcohol or biodiesel .
this means that algae can be much more efficient feedstock for biomass based biofuels than higher plants , particularly for biodiesel formation . the most promising feature of algae is , however , that they can produce molecular hydrogen directly from sunlight and water .
in the nature , this pathway is a kind of emergency valve and function only under very specific conditions .
as such , it has very minor capacity in natural algae .
the existence of this pathway , however , gives a great opportunity to bioscientists to use metabolic engineering in order to make hydrogen production very efficient . what are the benefits of these alternatives ? the main benefit is that there is no competition with food supply .
these alternatives are also very efficient .
in theory , solarbiohydrogen can be a real option for fossil fuels . what effect would the production of these alternatives have on the current production processes of biofuels -lrb- e.g. use of agricultural land , economies in places like brazil , the environment , the alleged contribution to the current food crisis -rrb- ? in general , sunlight is the driving force of the all new systems .
because algae can grow in salt water , the needed water can be pumped from the seas .
when the microalgal solarbiohydrogen systems will be fully developed , indeed , the limiting factor for hydrogen production will be size of bioreactors and availability of solar energy for algal photosynthesis . in present world , there is nearly absolute negative correlation between gdp and high mean daily irradiance .
in the future , when the sunlight will be the main energy source for the need of human beings , the today 's poorest countries will have something that rich countries really are craving .
this means for sure , that new energy business will colonize these poor but very sunny countries in africa and asia . there is no real democracy in these countries , and because of this , there is a risk that the money will flow to the rulers and solar energy money will spread the " middle east " all over central and north africa .
however , if western governments and public organizations monitor the technology transfer , the new energy technology will be a great opportunity to the developing countries . the basic idea of new generation biofuels is not to compete with resources needed to food production .
if in the future the sunny poor countries will be real players in global energy market , it means resources for them .
technology transfer must be linked to the requirements providing that the benefits will be used to modernize the whole society starting from agriculture . would the eu be interested in adopting fuels made from these alternatives or are they focused on ethanol and others ? eu has already a roadmap for a hydrogen economy .
ethanol is not the best solution and the eu knows this .
biodiesel from microalgae is a very attractive option for the eu as well . how easy or hard would it be to produce these alternatives and introduce them into industry and society ? biomass based systems are quite easy .
basically we have the technology , but low energy prices hinder the scaling up of the pilot scale plants .
when the oil price reaches a certain threshold , these technologies will take their part in the energy market . solarbiohydrogen , artificial photosynthesis and other these kinds of more advanced systems are still under development and some fundamental questions need to be solved before commercialisation .
however , the concept is clear and there should n't be anything in this respect that is not possible to solve . what is needed to make the system run is money and smart people .

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports energy -pipe- 15.09.2008 science edges towards a new generation of biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to biofuels such as ethanol from sugar cane could still help support economies dw-world.de talked to prof. eva-mari aro , an expert on plant physiology and molecular biology at the university of turku in finland , about the current developments in the pursuit of new biofuel technologies . dw-world.de : what are the most viable alternatives to biofuels like ethanol and how do they work ? eva-mari aro : new generation biofuels can be roughly divided into two groups : fuels , which use biomass as a raw material and systems where living organisms -lrb- or biomimicing devices -rrb- produce some liquid fuel , hydrogen or other gas directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide . biomass based biofuels are already close to real application and their breakthrough is mostly dependent on oil price .
however , accumulation of biomass is thermodynamically inefficient process and the conversion of biomass into the form liquid fuel decreases the efficiency more .
biomass has very low efficiency to store energy from sunlight and even in ideal situation they can replace only some percents from fossil fuels .
anyway , they are considered to be a good business when oil prise increases enough . biomass independent systems , in contrast , have very high efficacy in theory , and have real potential to replace fossil fuels .
however , there are still unsolved technical barriers against the real breakthrough of biomass free systems . nowadays ethanol and biodiesel are produced from the same raw materials than food .
this is very inefficient and ethically daunting way for fuel production .
in order to make system more sustainable , the first step is to replace food-based raw materials by more efficient and ethical feedstock .
practically this means organic waste falls , forests and special bioenergy crops and algae . considerable number of research and development is going on in this field .
the idea behind is to convert the biomass into the form of biofuel .
most of the resources are in development of physical , chemical and biochemical processes that can be used to produce biofuels from whatever bulk biomass .
other important area is to explore and develop new plants , which are more suitable for biofuel production as compared to the traditional food crops . agro , forest and oil industry is already involved in developing these systems and they no doubt believe that this will be a business .
indeed , the conversion of bulk biomass into liquid fuels can strongly increase the biofuel production .

" after that , we will see how the situation evolves , " solana said ahead of talks with eu foreign ministers in brussels .
on sunday , russia completed the withdrawal of its troops from western georgia , including the strategically important black sea port of poti , in accordance with the eu ceasefire deal .
the agreement reached on sept .
8 states that the eu must have at least 200 observers in georgia by oct .
1 if russia is to withdraw its troops from the buffer zones that it has since created .
" the withdrawal is a process , and we are glad that it has started , " said eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
diplomats say that 11 countries - the baltic states , belgium , britain , france , germany , italy , poland , spain and sweden - have already pledged support for the eu mission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 15.09.2008 conductor lorin maazel : masterpieces survive everything großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel said he looks forward to spending more time composing entering his final season as music director of the prestigious new york philharmonic , lorin maazel told dw-world.de about the legacy he leaves behind with the orchestra and his plans to compose and found a new festival . lorin maazel assumed the post of music director at the new york philharmonic , the oldest standing orchestra in the united states , in 2002 and will pass it on to alan gilbert at the end of the 2008-2009 season .
the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .

the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .

that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .

the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .

the crisis underscores how banks have squandered their most prized asset - trust - says dw 's karl zawadzky . trust is the beginning of everything .
and now , mistrust is the end of everything .
this was illustrated dramatically by events on wall street on monday .
trust in the stability of large american banks has evaporated , and mistrust now reigns on wall street as well as in financial districts in london , frankfurt and tokyo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking crisis has now claimed lehman brothers , america 's fourth-largest investment bank .
the institute was founded 158 years ago by german immigrants and recently has posted billion-strong losses quarter after quarter .
in the second quarter of this year , the institution registered a record loss of $ 4 million .
the frantic search for a new cash injection turned out to be in vain . on sunday night , the bank 's management had no choice but to file for chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy filing ever .
that has won the bank a little time to find fresh funds or perhaps to be taken under the wings of another large bank . if that does n't work out , liquidation of a once strong and proud bank is certain .
america 's third-largest investment bank , merrill lynch , has found a savior for now with the bank of america taking over the stricken institution . the shockwaves from reeling us financial markets has pushed global share markets into the red .
there remains no doubt that the international banking crisis has reached a new danger level .
the us government and the federal reserve are no longer prepared to take responsibility for the mistakes of private banks . six months ago , they facilitated the emergency sale of the comparatively small investment bank bear stearns to the financial institution j.p. morgan chase with a massive loan .
they also bailed out mortgage banks fannie mae and freddie mac with the staggering sum of $ 5 trillion .
but now apparently it 's the end of state bailouts or maybe the american state has reached the limits of its financial largesse .
after all , this is about a lot of money . lehman brothers has debts worth $ 613 billion .
of course , the government and the federal reserve will try to avoid a domino effect .
but first it 's up to the private financial sector to step in - not with words but with money .
ten leading international banks , including germany 's deutsche bank , are pooling in $ 70 billion in a fund to help each other with possible cash crunches . lehman brothers , a renowned traditional bank , is in a tailspin .
without a large investor - with really deep pockets - the end of the bank is nigh .
the bank first squandered away its billions and then fell victim to the raging mistrust in financial markets . lehman is n't the first bank to suffer this fate and probably wo n't be the last .
the current banking crisis is the result of too much cheap federal reserve money , endless greed and overly generous banking supervision .
that explains the mistakes and extremes rife in the current financial disaster . germany is also affected by it .
german banks have irresponsibly speculated with bad american mortgages .

metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .

the crisis underscores how banks have squandered their most prized asset - trust - says dw 's karl zawadzky . trust is the beginning of everything .
and now , mistrust is the end of everything .
this was illustrated dramatically by events on wall street on monday .
trust in the stability of large american banks has evaporated , and mistrust now reigns on wall street as well as in financial districts in london , frankfurt and tokyo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking crisis has now claimed lehman brothers , america 's fourth-largest investment bank .
the institute was founded 158 years ago by german immigrants and recently has posted billion-strong losses quarter after quarter .
in the second quarter of this year , the institution registered a record loss of $ 4 million .
the frantic search for a new cash injection turned out to be in vain . on sunday night , the bank 's management had no choice but to file for chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy filing ever .
that has won the bank a little time to find fresh funds or perhaps to be taken under the wings of another large bank . if that does n't work out , liquidation of a once strong and proud bank is certain .
america 's third-largest investment bank , merrill lynch , has found a savior for now with the bank of america taking over the stricken institution . the shockwaves from reeling us financial markets has pushed global share markets into the red .
there remains no doubt that the international banking crisis has reached a new danger level .
the us government and the federal reserve are no longer prepared to take responsibility for the mistakes of private banks . six months ago , they facilitated the emergency sale of the comparatively small investment bank bear stearns to the financial institution j.p. morgan chase with a massive loan .
they also bailed out mortgage banks fannie mae and freddie mac with the staggering sum of $ 5 trillion .
but now apparently it 's the end of state bailouts or maybe the american state has reached the limits of its financial largesse .
after all , this is about a lot of money . lehman brothers has debts worth $ 613 billion .
of course , the government and the federal reserve will try to avoid a domino effect .
but first it 's up to the private financial sector to step in - not with words but with money .
ten leading international banks , including germany 's deutsche bank , are pooling in $ 70 billion in a fund to help each other with possible cash crunches . lehman brothers , a renowned traditional bank , is in a tailspin .
without a large investor - with really deep pockets - the end of the bank is nigh .
the bank first squandered away its billions and then fell victim to the raging mistrust in financial markets . lehman is n't the first bank to suffer this fate and probably wo n't be the last .
the current banking crisis is the result of too much cheap federal reserve money , endless greed and overly generous banking supervision .
that explains the mistakes and extremes rife in the current financial disaster . germany is also affected by it .
german banks have irresponsibly speculated with bad american mortgages .
but in america , the crisis has a whole new dimension .
the result is n't just a financial disaster but also a political scandal . after the profits have been privatized , the losses are now being nationalized .
even if governments and federal reserves do n't stand by threatened banks , the banking crisis emanating from the us has squeezed the world economy . everybody is paying a price for the wrong acts of some .
in this context , calls for a stronger regulation of the financial sector are understandable .
banks have simply squandered trust .
but let 's not forget that it 's not money but rather the trust of investors and customers that is the most prized asset of banks .
that asset has been severely abused . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de after lehman , expert calls for framework on bank bailouts us banking giant lehman brothers is filing for bankruptcy , the latest us lender to bow to the pressures of the subprime mortgage crisis .
more losses are likely , a german economist told dw .
-lrb- 15.09.2008 -rrb- europe struggles with fallout from lehman failure european and asian share markets were badly shaken , as market indicators tumbled on the news that us investment bank lehman brothers would declare bankruptcy .
europe 's major central banks pledged their support .

metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .

workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .
similar impatience in the working and middle classes amid perceptions that they are slipping back has emerged in britain .
rallies for " fair " pay the labour government 's determination to restrain pay for public-sector workers will be challenged this autumn by teachers and civil servants , who say they are no longer prepared to live on wages eaten up by rising costs for food and fuel .
so far , prime minister gordon brown has argued that low wage demands over the past few years have contributed to economic growth and stability , low unemployment and a rise in living standards .
but after biting the bullet for most of the last 11 years of labour rule , and facing additional challenges from the global economic downturn and the credit crunch , the trade unions are no longer prepared to toe the line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are split on whether higher wages will lead to a wage-price spiral the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- voted this month for " days of action " this autumn in support of higher wages .
rather than strikes , there will be rallies and street protests for " fair pay . "
the tuc could no longer tolerate a sharp drop in living standards for members while the pay packets of bosses were going up by 20 or 30 percent , tuc secretary-general brendan barber said .
warning against pay hikes norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , said in an interview that the danger from pay hikes was real .
if pay were to rise sharply , " the outcome will be inflationary effects in the short term and probably a weakening in growth . "
" pay negotiators do not seem to realize that the terms of trade for nations that import energy and food have worsened , " he said .
declining terms of trade mean that a nation 's imports become more expensive in comparison to its exports .
walter said the ecb would not have had to keep its interest rates so high " if we had intelligent players " who understood that big picture .
earn more , spend more the opposing view comes from claus schaefer , an economist at germany 's trade-union think-tank wsi in dusseldorf , who studies how germans share their economic cake .
it was precisely because the world economy was weak that germans needed to earn more and spend more .
" domestic demand can ease the effects of an economic slowing and make a stabilizing contribution during the slowdown phase , " he said in an interview .
" in germany and in other eu nations we have had a very restrained incomes policy .
profits have risen sharply , but wages have stagnated in nominal terms and actually fallen in real terms , " schaefer said .
current pay claims were " a small correction to past inequalities . "
he dismissed fears of a wage-price spiral , which he said had only been seen in post-war germany in the late 1960s and the early 1980s .
deutsche bank 's walter disagreed , saying that boosting domestic demand in times of trouble is only helpful in low-debt economies .
but germany had high public debt and was struggling to provide for an ageing society .
" we have already eaten up our future at breakfast time , " he said .
inflation fears rise in eastern europe in eastern european nations , where the post-1989 change from communism to private enterprise has brought prosperity to many , fears have also been growing among labor groups that inflation will eat up the gains .
tough labor talks are expected in the czech republic this autumn as public and private-sector unions seek an 8-percent pay rise for 2009 .
the czech chamber of commerce called the demand unrealistic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.09.2008 opinion : american banks lose more than just money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choked by the credit crisis , lehman brothers , the 158-year-old us investment bank , has filed for bankruptcy .
the crisis underscores how banks have squandered their most prized asset - trust - says dw 's karl zawadzky . trust is the beginning of everything .
and now , mistrust is the end of everything .
this was illustrated dramatically by events on wall street on monday .
trust in the stability of large american banks has evaporated , and mistrust now reigns on wall street as well as in financial districts in london , frankfurt and tokyo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking crisis has now claimed lehman brothers , america 's fourth-largest investment bank .
the institute was founded 158 years ago by german immigrants and recently has posted billion-strong losses quarter after quarter .
in the second quarter of this year , the institution registered a record loss of $ 4 million .
the frantic search for a new cash injection turned out to be in vain . on sunday night , the bank 's management had no choice but to file for chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy filing ever .
that has won the bank a little time to find fresh funds or perhaps to be taken under the wings of another large bank . if that does n't work out , liquidation of a once strong and proud bank is certain .
america 's third-largest investment bank , merrill lynch , has found a savior for now with the bank of america taking over the stricken institution . the shockwaves from reeling us financial markets has pushed global share markets into the red .
there remains no doubt that the international banking crisis has reached a new danger level .
the us government and the federal reserve are no longer prepared to take responsibility for the mistakes of private banks . six months ago , they facilitated the emergency sale of the comparatively small investment bank bear stearns to the financial institution j.p. morgan chase with a massive loan .
they also bailed out mortgage banks fannie mae and freddie mac with the staggering sum of $ 5 trillion .
but now apparently it 's the end of state bailouts or maybe the american state has reached the limits of its financial largesse .
after all , this is about a lot of money . lehman brothers has debts worth $ 613 billion .
of course , the government and the federal reserve will try to avoid a domino effect .
but first it 's up to the private financial sector to step in - not with words but with money .
ten leading international banks , including germany 's deutsche bank , are pooling in $ 70 billion in a fund to help each other with possible cash crunches . lehman brothers , a renowned traditional bank , is in a tailspin .
without a large investor - with really deep pockets - the end of the bank is nigh .
the bank first squandered away its billions and then fell victim to the raging mistrust in financial markets . lehman is n't the first bank to suffer this fate and probably wo n't be the last .
the current banking crisis is the result of too much cheap federal reserve money , endless greed and overly generous banking supervision .

the crisis underscores how banks have squandered their most prized asset - trust - says dw 's karl zawadzky . trust is the beginning of everything .
and now , mistrust is the end of everything .
this was illustrated dramatically by events on wall street on monday .
trust in the stability of large american banks has evaporated , and mistrust now reigns on wall street as well as in financial districts in london , frankfurt and tokyo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking crisis has now claimed lehman brothers , america 's fourth-largest investment bank .
the institute was founded 158 years ago by german immigrants and recently has posted billion-strong losses quarter after quarter .
in the second quarter of this year , the institution registered a record loss of $ 4 million .
the frantic search for a new cash injection turned out to be in vain . on sunday night , the bank 's management had no choice but to file for chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy filing ever .
that has won the bank a little time to find fresh funds or perhaps to be taken under the wings of another large bank . if that does n't work out , liquidation of a once strong and proud bank is certain .
america 's third-largest investment bank , merrill lynch , has found a savior for now with the bank of america taking over the stricken institution . the shockwaves from reeling us financial markets has pushed global share markets into the red .
there remains no doubt that the international banking crisis has reached a new danger level .
the us government and the federal reserve are no longer prepared to take responsibility for the mistakes of private banks . six months ago , they facilitated the emergency sale of the comparatively small investment bank bear stearns to the financial institution j.p. morgan chase with a massive loan .
they also bailed out mortgage banks fannie mae and freddie mac with the staggering sum of $ 5 trillion .
but now apparently it 's the end of state bailouts or maybe the american state has reached the limits of its financial largesse .
after all , this is about a lot of money . lehman brothers has debts worth $ 613 billion .
of course , the government and the federal reserve will try to avoid a domino effect .
but first it 's up to the private financial sector to step in - not with words but with money .
ten leading international banks , including germany 's deutsche bank , are pooling in $ 70 billion in a fund to help each other with possible cash crunches . lehman brothers , a renowned traditional bank , is in a tailspin .
without a large investor - with really deep pockets - the end of the bank is nigh .
the bank first squandered away its billions and then fell victim to the raging mistrust in financial markets . lehman is n't the first bank to suffer this fate and probably wo n't be the last .
the current banking crisis is the result of too much cheap federal reserve money , endless greed and overly generous banking supervision .
that explains the mistakes and extremes rife in the current financial disaster . germany is also affected by it .
german banks have irresponsibly speculated with bad american mortgages .
but in america , the crisis has a whole new dimension .
the result is n't just a financial disaster but also a political scandal . after the profits have been privatized , the losses are now being nationalized .

" a handful of protesters gathered outside the courtroom holding a placard reading " mass murderer here !

the life imprisonment sentence , handed down in september 2006 , can not be enforced because germany does not extradite its own citizens .
german prosecutors in munich are expected to present many of the same documents and witnesses who described at the italy trial how the germans shot three men and a woman on the first day of the reprisal .
the next day , 11 males were locked inside the ground floor of the home of a villager , ferdinando cannicci , and it was blown up .

field marshal albert kesselring had ordered brutal reprisals to be conducted on italians if german troops were harmed .
ambush leads to reprisals on june 26 , partisans ambushed a three-man german patrol as it was about to requisition a horse in falzano .
two germans were killed without warning , but the third man got away only slightly wounded and told his fellow engineers .
the company 's lieutenant and his superior , a major in charge of the whole battalion , allegedly decided the engineers should mount a reprisal on the hamlet , which is in the hills making up the " backbone " of the italian peninsula between siena and perugia .
members of company 1 shot up the area , with a german anti-aircraft unit firing over it to scare off partisans .
four people , including a 74-year-old woman , were shot dead purely because they got in the way of the rampage .
later , the italians were forced to watch as charges were placed under their homes in the hamlet and they were blown up .
the men aged 16 to 66 were herded into one house and it was dynamited .
22 witnesses are called in munich , scheungraber is charged with 14 counts of murder with a base motive and the court has set down 11 hearing days up to oct .
21 .
it is likely to be a slow trial : the evidence is old , and hearing days are usually kept short in germany when the accused are elderly .
in total , 22 witnesses and three experts have been summoned .
the first issue will be to decide if the former lieutenant is fit to stand trial .
his former superior has already been ruled too frail to try .
munich lawyers said that the accused 's three-man defense team includes klaus goebel , who some reports link to a charity , the stille hilfe -lrb- silent aid -rrb- , that offered legal and other aid to nazis after the war .
trial lawyer goebel 's earlier clients have included ernst zuendel , who has been convicted of denying the holocaust , and the late anton malloth , who was jailed for life in 2001 on two counts of murder committed in nazi concentration camps . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is likely to be a slow trial : the evidence is old , and hearing days are usually kept short in germany when the accused are elderly .
in total , 22 witnesses and three experts have been summoned .
the first issue will be to decide if the former lieutenant is fit to stand trial .
his former superior has already been ruled too frail to try .

trial lawyer goebel 's earlier clients have included ernst zuendel , who has been convicted of denying the holocaust , and the late anton malloth , who was jailed for life in 2001 on two counts of murder committed in nazi concentration camps . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ambush leads to reprisals on june 26 , partisans ambushed a three-man german patrol as it was about to requisition a horse in falzano .
two germans were killed without warning , but the third man got away only slightly wounded and told his fellow engineers .
the company 's lieutenant and his superior , a major in charge of the whole battalion , allegedly decided the engineers should mount a reprisal on the hamlet , which is in the hills making up the " backbone " of the italian peninsula between siena and perugia .
members of company 1 shot up the area , with a german anti-aircraft unit firing over it to scare off partisans .
four people , including a 74-year-old woman , were shot dead purely because they got in the way of the rampage .
later , the italians were forced to watch as charges were placed under their homes in the hamlet and they were blown up .
the men aged 16 to 66 were herded into one house and it was dynamited .

" a handful of protesters gathered outside the courtroom holding a placard reading " mass murderer here !
give the murdered a name . " the former lieutenant has already been convicted once in absentia in la spezia , italy , by an italian military court of directing the june 26-27 , 1944 , atrocity at falzano , a hamlet in tuscany .
the life imprisonment sentence , handed down in september 2006 , can not be enforced because germany does not extradite its own citizens .
german prosecutors in munich are expected to present many of the same documents and witnesses who described at the italy trial how the germans shot three men and a woman on the first day of the reprisal .
the next day , 11 males were locked inside the ground floor of the home of a villager , ferdinando cannicci , and it was blown up .
only a teenager , cannicci , now 79 , survived and he is one of the few eyewitnesses still alive today .
two decades as a town councilor scheungraber lived in ottobrunn , a munich suburb , after world war ii and was a town councilor for two decades as well as honorary fire-brigade chief .
at italy 's request , german police interviewed him before the la spezia trial .
he confirmed he had been an officer of company 1 , battalion 818 of the mountain combat engineers in italy , but denied the atrocity .
the indictment describes how company 1 was near falzano to hold up advancing allied forces as the germans withdrew from italy in 1944 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will justice be served ?
field marshal albert kesselring had ordered brutal reprisals to be conducted on italians if german troops were harmed .
ambush leads to reprisals on june 26 , partisans ambushed a three-man german patrol as it was about to requisition a horse in falzano .
two germans were killed without warning , but the third man got away only slightly wounded and told his fellow engineers .
the company 's lieutenant and his superior , a major in charge of the whole battalion , allegedly decided the engineers should mount a reprisal on the hamlet , which is in the hills making up the " backbone " of the italian peninsula between siena and perugia .
members of company 1 shot up the area , with a german anti-aircraft unit firing over it to scare off partisans .
four people , including a 74-year-old woman , were shot dead purely because they got in the way of the rampage .
later , the italians were forced to watch as charges were placed under their homes in the hamlet and they were blown up .
the men aged 16 to 66 were herded into one house and it was dynamited .
22 witnesses are called in munich , scheungraber is charged with 14 counts of murder with a base motive and the court has set down 11 hearing days up to oct .
21 .
it is likely to be a slow trial : the evidence is old , and hearing days are usually kept short in germany when the accused are elderly .
in total , 22 witnesses and three experts have been summoned .
the first issue will be to decide if the former lieutenant is fit to stand trial .
his former superior has already been ruled too frail to try .
munich lawyers said that the accused 's three-man defense team includes klaus goebel , who some reports link to a charity , the stille hilfe -lrb- silent aid -rrb- , that offered legal and other aid to nazis after the war .
trial lawyer goebel 's earlier clients have included ernst zuendel , who has been convicted of denying the holocaust , and the late anton malloth , who was jailed for life in 2001 on two counts of murder committed in nazi concentration camps . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.09.2008 euro-zone workers seek pay hikes amid inflation fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions claim workers have n't gotten their share of recent growth calls for pay restraint as major european economies slip into recession are falling on deaf ears , with workers in numerous countries grumbling that they have gained few of the promised fruits of the last upswing . earlier in september , european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet hammered out a warning against " second-round effects in price and wage setting , " telling euro-zone citizens to put up with high world prices for fuel and food which are beyond governments ' control .
metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .
similar impatience in the working and middle classes amid perceptions that they are slipping back has emerged in britain .
rallies for " fair " pay the labour government 's determination to restrain pay for public-sector workers will be challenged this autumn by teachers and civil servants , who say they are no longer prepared to live on wages eaten up by rising costs for food and fuel .
so far , prime minister gordon brown has argued that low wage demands over the past few years have contributed to economic growth and stability , low unemployment and a rise in living standards .
but after biting the bullet for most of the last 11 years of labour rule , and facing additional challenges from the global economic downturn and the credit crunch , the trade unions are no longer prepared to toe the line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are split on whether higher wages will lead to a wage-price spiral the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- voted this month for " days of action " this autumn in support of higher wages .
rather than strikes , there will be rallies and street protests for " fair pay . "
the tuc could no longer tolerate a sharp drop in living standards for members while the pay packets of bosses were going up by 20 or 30 percent , tuc secretary-general brendan barber said .
warning against pay hikes norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , said in an interview that the danger from pay hikes was real .
if pay were to rise sharply , " the outcome will be inflationary effects in the short term and probably a weakening in growth . "
" pay negotiators do not seem to realize that the terms of trade for nations that import energy and food have worsened , " he said .
declining terms of trade mean that a nation 's imports become more expensive in comparison to its exports .
walter said the ecb would not have had to keep its interest rates so high " if we had intelligent players " who understood that big picture .
earn more , spend more the opposing view comes from claus schaefer , an economist at germany 's trade-union think-tank wsi in dusseldorf , who studies how germans share their economic cake .
it was precisely because the world economy was weak that germans needed to earn more and spend more .
" domestic demand can ease the effects of an economic slowing and make a stabilizing contribution during the slowdown phase , " he said in an interview .
" in germany and in other eu nations we have had a very restrained incomes policy .
profits have risen sharply , but wages have stagnated in nominal terms and actually fallen in real terms , " schaefer said .
current pay claims were " a small correction to past inequalities . "
he dismissed fears of a wage-price spiral , which he said had only been seen in post-war germany in the late 1960s and the early 1980s .
deutsche bank 's walter disagreed , saying that boosting domestic demand in times of trouble is only helpful in low-debt economies .
but germany had high public debt and was struggling to provide for an ageing society .
" we have already eaten up our future at breakfast time , " he said .
inflation fears rise in eastern europe in eastern european nations , where the post-1989 change from communism to private enterprise has brought prosperity to many , fears have also been growing among labor groups that inflation will eat up the gains .
tough labor talks are expected in the czech republic this autumn as public and private-sector unions seek an 8-percent pay rise for 2009 .
the czech chamber of commerce called the demand unrealistic .
koruna inflation cut real wage growth to 1.1 percent in the second quarter of 2008 , the lowest in 10 years .
a recent study found poles were earning more and have better job security , but the benefits of a stronger zloty have not helped all .
the solidarity union recently brought out at least 18,000 marchers for poland 's largest labor protest in years .
organizers displayed shopping carts with a few basic staples , saying the items were all a minimum-wage worker or retiree could afford .
labor rumblings have also been growing in the baltic nations as their years of boom fade .
latvia 's government has said it will freeze public-sector wages in 2009 , prompting union threats of labor action and calls for the government to resign . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .
similar impatience in the working and middle classes amid perceptions that they are slipping back has emerged in britain .
rallies for " fair " pay the labour government 's determination to restrain pay for public-sector workers will be challenged this autumn by teachers and civil servants , who say they are no longer prepared to live on wages eaten up by rising costs for food and fuel .
so far , prime minister gordon brown has argued that low wage demands over the past few years have contributed to economic growth and stability , low unemployment and a rise in living standards .
but after biting the bullet for most of the last 11 years of labour rule , and facing additional challenges from the global economic downturn and the credit crunch , the trade unions are no longer prepared to toe the line .

warning against pay hikes norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , said in an interview that the danger from pay hikes was real .
if pay were to rise sharply , " the outcome will be inflationary effects in the short term and probably a weakening in growth . "
" pay negotiators do not seem to realize that the terms of trade for nations that import energy and food have worsened , " he said .
declining terms of trade mean that a nation 's imports become more expensive in comparison to its exports .
walter said the ecb would not have had to keep its interest rates so high " if we had intelligent players " who understood that big picture .
earn more , spend more the opposing view comes from claus schaefer , an economist at germany 's trade-union think-tank wsi in dusseldorf , who studies how germans share their economic cake .
it was precisely because the world economy was weak that germans needed to earn more and spend more .
" domestic demand can ease the effects of an economic slowing and make a stabilizing contribution during the slowdown phase , " he said in an interview .
" in germany and in other eu nations we have had a very restrained incomes policy .
profits have risen sharply , but wages have stagnated in nominal terms and actually fallen in real terms , " schaefer said .
current pay claims were " a small correction to past inequalities . "
he dismissed fears of a wage-price spiral , which he said had only been seen in post-war germany in the late 1960s and the early 1980s .

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports energy -pipe- 15.09.2008 science edges towards a new generation of biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to biofuels such as ethanol from sugar cane could still help support economies dw-world.de talked to prof. eva-mari aro , an expert on plant physiology and molecular biology at the university of turku in finland , about the current developments in the pursuit of new biofuel technologies . dw-world.de : what are the most viable alternatives to biofuels like ethanol and how do they work ? eva-mari aro : new generation biofuels can be roughly divided into two groups : fuels , which use biomass as a raw material and systems where living organisms -lrb- or biomimicing devices -rrb- produce some liquid fuel , hydrogen or other gas directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide . biomass based biofuels are already close to real application and their breakthrough is mostly dependent on oil price .
however , accumulation of biomass is thermodynamically inefficient process and the conversion of biomass into the form liquid fuel decreases the efficiency more .
biomass has very low efficiency to store energy from sunlight and even in ideal situation they can replace only some percents from fossil fuels .
anyway , they are considered to be a good business when oil prise increases enough . biomass independent systems , in contrast , have very high efficacy in theory , and have real potential to replace fossil fuels .
however , there are still unsolved technical barriers against the real breakthrough of biomass free systems . nowadays ethanol and biodiesel are produced from the same raw materials than food .
this is very inefficient and ethically daunting way for fuel production .
in order to make system more sustainable , the first step is to replace food-based raw materials by more efficient and ethical feedstock .
practically this means organic waste falls , forests and special bioenergy crops and algae . considerable number of research and development is going on in this field .
the idea behind is to convert the biomass into the form of biofuel .
most of the resources are in development of physical , chemical and biochemical processes that can be used to produce biofuels from whatever bulk biomass .
other important area is to explore and develop new plants , which are more suitable for biofuel production as compared to the traditional food crops . agro , forest and oil industry is already involved in developing these systems and they no doubt believe that this will be a business .
indeed , the conversion of bulk biomass into liquid fuels can strongly increase the biofuel production .
however , to be honest , biomass never can replace oil , unless the energy consumption on human population will drop to a fraction of the present one , which will not happen without nuclear war-like catastrophe . the fundamental problem of biomass is that plants store the energy from sunlight into their biomass very inefficiently .
plants are not evolved to be the feedstock of energy production for human activities .
in order to make accumulation of biomass more efficient plants must be pushed to store solar energy many times more efficiently than they do in the nature .
however , plants are so complicated organisms that most probably this will be a mission impossible . as compared to real plants , unicellular algae are simpler and easier to manipulate .
only one type of cell does the all tasks from harvesting the light energy to storage of the energy and for reproduction .
moreover , algae can grow in seawater , which is a great advance when compared to plants . under certain conditions algae can double the biomass in one day and large share of this biomass can be starch or oil , which are easy and energy efficient to convert into form of alcohol or biodiesel .
this means that algae can be much more efficient feedstock for biomass based biofuels than higher plants , particularly for biodiesel formation . the most promising feature of algae is , however , that they can produce molecular hydrogen directly from sunlight and water .
in the nature , this pathway is a kind of emergency valve and function only under very specific conditions .
as such , it has very minor capacity in natural algae .
the existence of this pathway , however , gives a great opportunity to bioscientists to use metabolic engineering in order to make hydrogen production very efficient . what are the benefits of these alternatives ? the main benefit is that there is no competition with food supply .
these alternatives are also very efficient .
in theory , solarbiohydrogen can be a real option for fossil fuels . what effect would the production of these alternatives have on the current production processes of biofuels -lrb- e.g. use of agricultural land , economies in places like brazil , the environment , the alleged contribution to the current food crisis -rrb- ? in general , sunlight is the driving force of the all new systems .
because algae can grow in salt water , the needed water can be pumped from the seas .
when the microalgal solarbiohydrogen systems will be fully developed , indeed , the limiting factor for hydrogen production will be size of bioreactors and availability of solar energy for algal photosynthesis . in present world , there is nearly absolute negative correlation between gdp and high mean daily irradiance .
in the future , when the sunlight will be the main energy source for the need of human beings , the today 's poorest countries will have something that rich countries really are craving .
this means for sure , that new energy business will colonize these poor but very sunny countries in africa and asia . there is no real democracy in these countries , and because of this , there is a risk that the money will flow to the rulers and solar energy money will spread the " middle east " all over central and north africa .
however , if western governments and public organizations monitor the technology transfer , the new energy technology will be a great opportunity to the developing countries . the basic idea of new generation biofuels is not to compete with resources needed to food production .
if in the future the sunny poor countries will be real players in global energy market , it means resources for them .
technology transfer must be linked to the requirements providing that the benefits will be used to modernize the whole society starting from agriculture . would the eu be interested in adopting fuels made from these alternatives or are they focused on ethanol and others ? eu has already a roadmap for a hydrogen economy .
ethanol is not the best solution and the eu knows this .
biodiesel from microalgae is a very attractive option for the eu as well . how easy or hard would it be to produce these alternatives and introduce them into industry and society ? biomass based systems are quite easy .
basically we have the technology , but low energy prices hinder the scaling up of the pilot scale plants .
when the oil price reaches a certain threshold , these technologies will take their part in the energy market . solarbiohydrogen , artificial photosynthesis and other these kinds of more advanced systems are still under development and some fundamental questions need to be solved before commercialisation .
however , the concept is clear and there should n't be anything in this respect that is not possible to solve . what is needed to make the system run is money and smart people .
if industry starts to finance the projects , investments must be a part of their long-term business strategy .
society has to accept genetic manipulation .
in advanced bioenergy field we ca n't do anything without all the tools of modern biotechnology .
anti genetically modified organism -lrb- gmo -rrb- people really should think what the price of banning gmos would be . in general , when massive amounts of hydrogen flow out from bioreactors , everything after that will go fluently .
the transfer from an oil economy to a hydrogen economy is just a set of political decisions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports energy -pipe- 15.09.2008 science edges towards a new generation of biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to biofuels such as ethanol from sugar cane could still help support economies dw-world.de talked to prof. eva-mari aro , an expert on plant physiology and molecular biology at the university of turku in finland , about the current developments in the pursuit of new biofuel technologies . dw-world.de : what are the most viable alternatives to biofuels like ethanol and how do they work ? eva-mari aro : new generation biofuels can be roughly divided into two groups : fuels , which use biomass as a raw material and systems where living organisms -lrb- or biomimicing devices -rrb- produce some liquid fuel , hydrogen or other gas directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide . biomass based biofuels are already close to real application and their breakthrough is mostly dependent on oil price .
however , accumulation of biomass is thermodynamically inefficient process and the conversion of biomass into the form liquid fuel decreases the efficiency more .
biomass has very low efficiency to store energy from sunlight and even in ideal situation they can replace only some percents from fossil fuels .
anyway , they are considered to be a good business when oil prise increases enough . biomass independent systems , in contrast , have very high efficacy in theory , and have real potential to replace fossil fuels .
however , there are still unsolved technical barriers against the real breakthrough of biomass free systems . nowadays ethanol and biodiesel are produced from the same raw materials than food .
this is very inefficient and ethically daunting way for fuel production .
in order to make system more sustainable , the first step is to replace food-based raw materials by more efficient and ethical feedstock .
practically this means organic waste falls , forests and special bioenergy crops and algae . considerable number of research and development is going on in this field .
the idea behind is to convert the biomass into the form of biofuel .
most of the resources are in development of physical , chemical and biochemical processes that can be used to produce biofuels from whatever bulk biomass .
other important area is to explore and develop new plants , which are more suitable for biofuel production as compared to the traditional food crops . agro , forest and oil industry is already involved in developing these systems and they no doubt believe that this will be a business .
indeed , the conversion of bulk biomass into liquid fuels can strongly increase the biofuel production .
however , to be honest , biomass never can replace oil , unless the energy consumption on human population will drop to a fraction of the present one , which will not happen without nuclear war-like catastrophe . the fundamental problem of biomass is that plants store the energy from sunlight into their biomass very inefficiently .
plants are not evolved to be the feedstock of energy production for human activities .
in order to make accumulation of biomass more efficient plants must be pushed to store solar energy many times more efficiently than they do in the nature .
however , plants are so complicated organisms that most probably this will be a mission impossible . as compared to real plants , unicellular algae are simpler and easier to manipulate .
only one type of cell does the all tasks from harvesting the light energy to storage of the energy and for reproduction .
moreover , algae can grow in seawater , which is a great advance when compared to plants . under certain conditions algae can double the biomass in one day and large share of this biomass can be starch or oil , which are easy and energy efficient to convert into form of alcohol or biodiesel .
this means that algae can be much more efficient feedstock for biomass based biofuels than higher plants , particularly for biodiesel formation . the most promising feature of algae is , however , that they can produce molecular hydrogen directly from sunlight and water .
in the nature , this pathway is a kind of emergency valve and function only under very specific conditions .
as such , it has very minor capacity in natural algae .
the existence of this pathway , however , gives a great opportunity to bioscientists to use metabolic engineering in order to make hydrogen production very efficient . what are the benefits of these alternatives ? the main benefit is that there is no competition with food supply .
these alternatives are also very efficient .
in theory , solarbiohydrogen can be a real option for fossil fuels . what effect would the production of these alternatives have on the current production processes of biofuels -lrb- e.g. use of agricultural land , economies in places like brazil , the environment , the alleged contribution to the current food crisis -rrb- ? in general , sunlight is the driving force of the all new systems .
because algae can grow in salt water , the needed water can be pumped from the seas .
when the microalgal solarbiohydrogen systems will be fully developed , indeed , the limiting factor for hydrogen production will be size of bioreactors and availability of solar energy for algal photosynthesis . in present world , there is nearly absolute negative correlation between gdp and high mean daily irradiance .
in the future , when the sunlight will be the main energy source for the need of human beings , the today 's poorest countries will have something that rich countries really are craving .
this means for sure , that new energy business will colonize these poor but very sunny countries in africa and asia . there is no real democracy in these countries , and because of this , there is a risk that the money will flow to the rulers and solar energy money will spread the " middle east " all over central and north africa .
however , if western governments and public organizations monitor the technology transfer , the new energy technology will be a great opportunity to the developing countries . the basic idea of new generation biofuels is not to compete with resources needed to food production .
if in the future the sunny poor countries will be real players in global energy market , it means resources for them .
technology transfer must be linked to the requirements providing that the benefits will be used to modernize the whole society starting from agriculture . would the eu be interested in adopting fuels made from these alternatives or are they focused on ethanol and others ? eu has already a roadmap for a hydrogen economy .
ethanol is not the best solution and the eu knows this .
biodiesel from microalgae is a very attractive option for the eu as well . how easy or hard would it be to produce these alternatives and introduce them into industry and society ? biomass based systems are quite easy .
basically we have the technology , but low energy prices hinder the scaling up of the pilot scale plants .
when the oil price reaches a certain threshold , these technologies will take their part in the energy market . solarbiohydrogen , artificial photosynthesis and other these kinds of more advanced systems are still under development and some fundamental questions need to be solved before commercialisation .
however , the concept is clear and there should n't be anything in this respect that is not possible to solve . what is needed to make the system run is money and smart people .
if industry starts to finance the projects , investments must be a part of their long-term business strategy .
society has to accept genetic manipulation .
in advanced bioenergy field we ca n't do anything without all the tools of modern biotechnology .
anti genetically modified organism -lrb- gmo -rrb- people really should think what the price of banning gmos would be . in general , when massive amounts of hydrogen flow out from bioreactors , everything after that will go fluently .
the transfer from an oil economy to a hydrogen economy is just a set of political decisions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the eu-brokered cease-fire left moscow with too much leeway , he said . scheffer blamed oversights in an eu-brokered peace deal for not demanding the full withdrawal of troops to their bases in russia before the war with georgia last month . the nato secretary-general made the comments in an interview with the financial times shortly before he travelled to tbilisi on monday , sept .
15 , in a show of support for georgia 's nato membership ambitions . " if the russians are staying in south ossetia with so many forces , i do not consider this as a return to the status quo , " scheffer told the british newspaper .
" the option of keeping russian forces in south ossetia and abkhazia is not acceptable . " scheffer later on monday denied portions of the report in which he was critical of the georgia peace deal , saying he had only raised concerns about russia 's implementation of it . " the secretary-general remains fully supportive of the agreement negotiated by president sarkozy , " nato spokesman james appathurai said , according to the afp news agency .

more losses are likely , a german economist told dw . dr. michael schroeder is the head of the department of international finance and financial management at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , a non-profit economic research institute in mannheim , germany . deutsche welle : dr. schroeder , how will lehman 's collapse affect europe ? michael schroeder : that question is difficult to answer .
lehman does n't have much systemic risk , or risk with a high probability that it will pull down other banks in its wake .
so i do n't expect the direct counterparts in the banking sector will be hit very strongly . but it is a signal that much greater-than-expected problems in the banking sector are yet to come .
some experts thought one or two months ago that the worse of the subprime crisis was over .
but as we see in the news , this is not the case .
it was very optimistic . world stock markets dropped sharply at the lehman bankruptcy news .
why does the failure of one us bank have such far-reaching financial effects ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says more problems are yet to come i think it has to do with the fact that there still very high losses to come in the near future .
we see that hedge funds , or so-called monoline insurance companies , or other banking institutions could go bankrupt or near-bankrupt by the end of the year - particularly in the us but also perhaps in europe , due to collateral damage in the sector . the expectations are now that high losses could come in the next two or three months .
this will also hurt the business cycle in europe .
but it is difficult to predict to how great an extent ; how strong the impact will be . should consumers in germany be concerned ? well , yes , german consumers should be concerned because the business cycle will be relatively weak over the next year .
but the consumers themselves are part of the problem .
the economy gets weaker , they become more risk averse , then they consume less , and it drives the cycle downwards . ...
germans should consumer more , to combat this cycle . the us government opted not to bail out lehman .
yet the german government recently went to the aid of the ikb bank , when that lender nearly collapsed in the wake of the subprime crisis ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billions of euros were spent bailing out the ikb bank i think bailing out banks or companies has a lot to do with so-called systemic risks .
i do not expect that lehman really will have a strong effect on other banks or banking systems … so the us was right for not bailing out lehman brothers , in my opinion . i also did n't understand why the german government bailed out ikb .
in my opinion it was absolutely unnecessary , and it imposes relatively high costs to the taxpayers in germany . one us analyst is comparing this monday to a certain black monday back in 1929 .
is that realistic ? that is absolutely exaggerated ...
i do n't believe we have an unmanageable , or even an extremely strong , crisis right now .
the stock markets and all the other markets have reacted realistically . there are , of course , very high losses .
but it is not a catastrophe . is there a lesson to draw from this turn of events ? we need a new framework for the banking industry that should be instituted when this crisis is over .
we need clear rules that say when to bail out and when not to bail out a company . politicians should make it clear that banks can go bankrupt . ...
there are many medium size banks that should be allowed to go bankrupt when they have no liquidity anymore . we also need to have a framework for how it should be handled when a bank is bailed out .
managers should n't be allowed to get away with being extremely risk-loving and then not have to pay the price if that strategy fails . when the economy absorbs losses it should be clear who has to pay for these losses .

more losses are likely , a german economist told dw . dr. michael schroeder is the head of the department of international finance and financial management at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , a non-profit economic research institute in mannheim , germany . deutsche welle : dr. schroeder , how will lehman 's collapse affect europe ? michael schroeder : that question is difficult to answer .
lehman does n't have much systemic risk , or risk with a high probability that it will pull down other banks in its wake .
so i do n't expect the direct counterparts in the banking sector will be hit very strongly . but it is a signal that much greater-than-expected problems in the banking sector are yet to come .
some experts thought one or two months ago that the worse of the subprime crisis was over .
but as we see in the news , this is not the case .
it was very optimistic . world stock markets dropped sharply at the lehman bankruptcy news .
why does the failure of one us bank have such far-reaching financial effects ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says more problems are yet to come i think it has to do with the fact that there still very high losses to come in the near future .
we see that hedge funds , or so-called monoline insurance companies , or other banking institutions could go bankrupt or near-bankrupt by the end of the year - particularly in the us but also perhaps in europe , due to collateral damage in the sector . the expectations are now that high losses could come in the next two or three months .
this will also hurt the business cycle in europe .
but it is difficult to predict to how great an extent ; how strong the impact will be . should consumers in germany be concerned ? well , yes , german consumers should be concerned because the business cycle will be relatively weak over the next year .
but the consumers themselves are part of the problem .
the economy gets weaker , they become more risk averse , then they consume less , and it drives the cycle downwards . ...
germans should consumer more , to combat this cycle . the us government opted not to bail out lehman .
yet the german government recently went to the aid of the ikb bank , when that lender nearly collapsed in the wake of the subprime crisis ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billions of euros were spent bailing out the ikb bank i think bailing out banks or companies has a lot to do with so-called systemic risks .
i do not expect that lehman really will have a strong effect on other banks or banking systems … so the us was right for not bailing out lehman brothers , in my opinion . i also did n't understand why the german government bailed out ikb .
in my opinion it was absolutely unnecessary , and it imposes relatively high costs to the taxpayers in germany . one us analyst is comparing this monday to a certain black monday back in 1929 .
is that realistic ? that is absolutely exaggerated ...
i do n't believe we have an unmanageable , or even an extremely strong , crisis right now .
the stock markets and all the other markets have reacted realistically . there are , of course , very high losses .
but it is not a catastrophe . is there a lesson to draw from this turn of events ? we need a new framework for the banking industry that should be instituted when this crisis is over .
we need clear rules that say when to bail out and when not to bail out a company . politicians should make it clear that banks can go bankrupt . ...
there are many medium size banks that should be allowed to go bankrupt when they have no liquidity anymore . we also need to have a framework for how it should be handled when a bank is bailed out .
managers should n't be allowed to get away with being extremely risk-loving and then not have to pay the price if that strategy fails . when the economy absorbs losses it should be clear who has to pay for these losses .
the taxpayer should n't always have to pay . interview : mark hallam , jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 15.09.2008 eu approves observer mission to georgia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the war with russia has displaced thousands of georgians eu foreign ministers on monday gave the go-ahead for a 200-strong observer mission to georgia but questions still remain over whether the force would be deployed in the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday , sept .
15 , the bloc 's priority was to deploy 200 observers in georgia before oct . 1 , in compliance with a ceasefire brokered by french president nicolas sarkozy earlier this month . " after that , we will see how the situation evolves , " solana said ahead of talks with eu foreign ministers in brussels .
on sunday , russia completed the withdrawal of its troops from western georgia , including the strategically important black sea port of poti , in accordance with the eu ceasefire deal .
the agreement reached on sept .
8 states that the eu must have at least 200 observers in georgia by oct .
1 if russia is to withdraw its troops from the buffer zones that it has since created .
" the withdrawal is a process , and we are glad that it has started , " said eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .

15 , the bloc 's priority was to deploy 200 observers in georgia before oct . 1 , in compliance with a ceasefire brokered by french president nicolas sarkozy earlier this month . " after that , we will see how the situation evolves , " solana said ahead of talks with eu foreign ministers in brussels .
on sunday , russia completed the withdrawal of its troops from western georgia , including the strategically important black sea port of poti , in accordance with the eu ceasefire deal .
the agreement reached on sept .
8 states that the eu must have at least 200 observers in georgia by oct .
1 if russia is to withdraw its troops from the buffer zones that it has since created .
" the withdrawal is a process , and we are glad that it has started , " said eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
diplomats say that 11 countries - the baltic states , belgium , britain , france , germany , italy , poland , spain and sweden - have already pledged support for the eu mission .
" we are very committed to making sure that we play our full part in that important mission , meeting the deadline and getting the right number of people in at the right time to the right places , " british foreign minister david miliband said .
russia against eu observers in breakaway regions the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is already mandated to post observers in south ossetia , and talks are under way to boost their number by another 80 , said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who currently holds the osce 's rotating presidency .
" we have a mandate to go into south ossetia for 80 people .
what the final outcome of the 80 will be we do n't know , that 's what the georgians and russians are discussing and i think it 's a very positive development because they 're sitting together around the table , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia resists the idea of eu observers in the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia russia has so far rejected any suggestion that the eu should send its own observers into the breakaway regions , leaving the eu 's foreign ministers walking a tight-rope as they draw up the mission 's mandate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.09.2008 euro-zone workers seek pay hikes amid inflation fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions claim workers have n't gotten their share of recent growth calls for pay restraint as major european economies slip into recession are falling on deaf ears , with workers in numerous countries grumbling that they have gained few of the promised fruits of the last upswing . earlier in september , european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet hammered out a warning against " second-round effects in price and wage setting , " telling euro-zone citizens to put up with high world prices for fuel and food which are beyond governments ' control .
metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .
similar impatience in the working and middle classes amid perceptions that they are slipping back has emerged in britain .
rallies for " fair " pay the labour government 's determination to restrain pay for public-sector workers will be challenged this autumn by teachers and civil servants , who say they are no longer prepared to live on wages eaten up by rising costs for food and fuel .
so far , prime minister gordon brown has argued that low wage demands over the past few years have contributed to economic growth and stability , low unemployment and a rise in living standards .
but after biting the bullet for most of the last 11 years of labour rule , and facing additional challenges from the global economic downturn and the credit crunch , the trade unions are no longer prepared to toe the line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are split on whether higher wages will lead to a wage-price spiral the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- voted this month for " days of action " this autumn in support of higher wages .
rather than strikes , there will be rallies and street protests for " fair pay . "
the tuc could no longer tolerate a sharp drop in living standards for members while the pay packets of bosses were going up by 20 or 30 percent , tuc secretary-general brendan barber said .
warning against pay hikes norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , said in an interview that the danger from pay hikes was real .
if pay were to rise sharply , " the outcome will be inflationary effects in the short term and probably a weakening in growth . "
" pay negotiators do not seem to realize that the terms of trade for nations that import energy and food have worsened , " he said .
declining terms of trade mean that a nation 's imports become more expensive in comparison to its exports .
walter said the ecb would not have had to keep its interest rates so high " if we had intelligent players " who understood that big picture .
earn more , spend more the opposing view comes from claus schaefer , an economist at germany 's trade-union think-tank wsi in dusseldorf , who studies how germans share their economic cake .
it was precisely because the world economy was weak that germans needed to earn more and spend more .
" domestic demand can ease the effects of an economic slowing and make a stabilizing contribution during the slowdown phase , " he said in an interview .
" in germany and in other eu nations we have had a very restrained incomes policy .
profits have risen sharply , but wages have stagnated in nominal terms and actually fallen in real terms , " schaefer said .
current pay claims were " a small correction to past inequalities . "
he dismissed fears of a wage-price spiral , which he said had only been seen in post-war germany in the late 1960s and the early 1980s .
deutsche bank 's walter disagreed , saying that boosting domestic demand in times of trouble is only helpful in low-debt economies .
but germany had high public debt and was struggling to provide for an ageing society .
" we have already eaten up our future at breakfast time , " he said .
inflation fears rise in eastern europe in eastern european nations , where the post-1989 change from communism to private enterprise has brought prosperity to many , fears have also been growing among labor groups that inflation will eat up the gains .
tough labor talks are expected in the czech republic this autumn as public and private-sector unions seek an 8-percent pay rise for 2009 .
the czech chamber of commerce called the demand unrealistic .
koruna inflation cut real wage growth to 1.1 percent in the second quarter of 2008 , the lowest in 10 years .
a recent study found poles were earning more and have better job security , but the benefits of a stronger zloty have not helped all .
the solidarity union recently brought out at least 18,000 marchers for poland 's largest labor protest in years .

the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a handful of protesters gathered outside the courtroom holding a placard reading " mass murderer here !
give the murdered a name . " the former lieutenant has already been convicted once in absentia in la spezia , italy , by an italian military court of directing the june 26-27 , 1944 , atrocity at falzano , a hamlet in tuscany .
the life imprisonment sentence , handed down in september 2006 , can not be enforced because germany does not extradite its own citizens .
german prosecutors in munich are expected to present many of the same documents and witnesses who described at the italy trial how the germans shot three men and a woman on the first day of the reprisal .
the next day , 11 males were locked inside the ground floor of the home of a villager , ferdinando cannicci , and it was blown up .
only a teenager , cannicci , now 79 , survived and he is one of the few eyewitnesses still alive today .
two decades as a town councilor scheungraber lived in ottobrunn , a munich suburb , after world war ii and was a town councilor for two decades as well as honorary fire-brigade chief .
at italy 's request , german police interviewed him before the la spezia trial .
he confirmed he had been an officer of company 1 , battalion 818 of the mountain combat engineers in italy , but denied the atrocity .
the indictment describes how company 1 was near falzano to hold up advancing allied forces as the germans withdrew from italy in 1944 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will justice be served ?
field marshal albert kesselring had ordered brutal reprisals to be conducted on italians if german troops were harmed .
ambush leads to reprisals on june 26 , partisans ambushed a three-man german patrol as it was about to requisition a horse in falzano .
two germans were killed without warning , but the third man got away only slightly wounded and told his fellow engineers .
the company 's lieutenant and his superior , a major in charge of the whole battalion , allegedly decided the engineers should mount a reprisal on the hamlet , which is in the hills making up the " backbone " of the italian peninsula between siena and perugia .
members of company 1 shot up the area , with a german anti-aircraft unit firing over it to scare off partisans .
four people , including a 74-year-old woman , were shot dead purely because they got in the way of the rampage .
later , the italians were forced to watch as charges were placed under their homes in the hamlet and they were blown up .
the men aged 16 to 66 were herded into one house and it was dynamited .
22 witnesses are called in munich , scheungraber is charged with 14 counts of murder with a base motive and the court has set down 11 hearing days up to oct .
21 .
it is likely to be a slow trial : the evidence is old , and hearing days are usually kept short in germany when the accused are elderly .
in total , 22 witnesses and three experts have been summoned .
the first issue will be to decide if the former lieutenant is fit to stand trial .
his former superior has already been ruled too frail to try .
munich lawyers said that the accused 's three-man defense team includes klaus goebel , who some reports link to a charity , the stille hilfe -lrb- silent aid -rrb- , that offered legal and other aid to nazis after the war .
trial lawyer goebel 's earlier clients have included ernst zuendel , who has been convicted of denying the holocaust , and the late anton malloth , who was jailed for life in 2001 on two counts of murder committed in nazi concentration camps . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crisis underscores how banks have squandered their most prized asset - trust - says dw 's karl zawadzky . trust is the beginning of everything .
and now , mistrust is the end of everything .
this was illustrated dramatically by events on wall street on monday .
trust in the stability of large american banks has evaporated , and mistrust now reigns on wall street as well as in financial districts in london , frankfurt and tokyo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking crisis has now claimed lehman brothers , america 's fourth-largest investment bank .
the institute was founded 158 years ago by german immigrants and recently has posted billion-strong losses quarter after quarter .
in the second quarter of this year , the institution registered a record loss of $ 4 million .
the frantic search for a new cash injection turned out to be in vain . on sunday night , the bank 's management had no choice but to file for chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy filing ever .
that has won the bank a little time to find fresh funds or perhaps to be taken under the wings of another large bank . if that does n't work out , liquidation of a once strong and proud bank is certain .
america 's third-largest investment bank , merrill lynch , has found a savior for now with the bank of america taking over the stricken institution . the shockwaves from reeling us financial markets has pushed global share markets into the red .
there remains no doubt that the international banking crisis has reached a new danger level .
the us government and the federal reserve are no longer prepared to take responsibility for the mistakes of private banks . six months ago , they facilitated the emergency sale of the comparatively small investment bank bear stearns to the financial institution j.p. morgan chase with a massive loan .
they also bailed out mortgage banks fannie mae and freddie mac with the staggering sum of $ 5 trillion .
but now apparently it 's the end of state bailouts or maybe the american state has reached the limits of its financial largesse .
after all , this is about a lot of money . lehman brothers has debts worth $ 613 billion .
of course , the government and the federal reserve will try to avoid a domino effect .
but first it 's up to the private financial sector to step in - not with words but with money .
ten leading international banks , including germany 's deutsche bank , are pooling in $ 70 billion in a fund to help each other with possible cash crunches . lehman brothers , a renowned traditional bank , is in a tailspin .
without a large investor - with really deep pockets - the end of the bank is nigh .
the bank first squandered away its billions and then fell victim to the raging mistrust in financial markets . lehman is n't the first bank to suffer this fate and probably wo n't be the last .
the current banking crisis is the result of too much cheap federal reserve money , endless greed and overly generous banking supervision .
that explains the mistakes and extremes rife in the current financial disaster . germany is also affected by it .
german banks have irresponsibly speculated with bad american mortgages .
but in america , the crisis has a whole new dimension .
the result is n't just a financial disaster but also a political scandal . after the profits have been privatized , the losses are now being nationalized .
even if governments and federal reserves do n't stand by threatened banks , the banking crisis emanating from the us has squeezed the world economy . everybody is paying a price for the wrong acts of some .
in this context , calls for a stronger regulation of the financial sector are understandable .

after all , this is about a lot of money . lehman brothers has debts worth $ 613 billion .
of course , the government and the federal reserve will try to avoid a domino effect .
but first it 's up to the private financial sector to step in - not with words but with money .
ten leading international banks , including germany 's deutsche bank , are pooling in $ 70 billion in a fund to help each other with possible cash crunches . lehman brothers , a renowned traditional bank , is in a tailspin .
without a large investor - with really deep pockets - the end of the bank is nigh .
the bank first squandered away its billions and then fell victim to the raging mistrust in financial markets . lehman is n't the first bank to suffer this fate and probably wo n't be the last .
the current banking crisis is the result of too much cheap federal reserve money , endless greed and overly generous banking supervision .
that explains the mistakes and extremes rife in the current financial disaster . germany is also affected by it .
german banks have irresponsibly speculated with bad american mortgages .
but in america , the crisis has a whole new dimension .
the result is n't just a financial disaster but also a political scandal . after the profits have been privatized , the losses are now being nationalized .
even if governments and federal reserves do n't stand by threatened banks , the banking crisis emanating from the us has squeezed the world economy . everybody is paying a price for the wrong acts of some .
in this context , calls for a stronger regulation of the financial sector are understandable .
banks have simply squandered trust .
but let 's not forget that it 's not money but rather the trust of investors and customers that is the most prized asset of banks .
that asset has been severely abused . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .
similar impatience in the working and middle classes amid perceptions that they are slipping back has emerged in britain .
rallies for " fair " pay the labour government 's determination to restrain pay for public-sector workers will be challenged this autumn by teachers and civil servants , who say they are no longer prepared to live on wages eaten up by rising costs for food and fuel .
so far , prime minister gordon brown has argued that low wage demands over the past few years have contributed to economic growth and stability , low unemployment and a rise in living standards .
but after biting the bullet for most of the last 11 years of labour rule , and facing additional challenges from the global economic downturn and the credit crunch , the trade unions are no longer prepared to toe the line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are split on whether higher wages will lead to a wage-price spiral the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- voted this month for " days of action " this autumn in support of higher wages .
rather than strikes , there will be rallies and street protests for " fair pay . "
the tuc could no longer tolerate a sharp drop in living standards for members while the pay packets of bosses were going up by 20 or 30 percent , tuc secretary-general brendan barber said .
warning against pay hikes norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , said in an interview that the danger from pay hikes was real .
if pay were to rise sharply , " the outcome will be inflationary effects in the short term and probably a weakening in growth . "
" pay negotiators do not seem to realize that the terms of trade for nations that import energy and food have worsened , " he said .
declining terms of trade mean that a nation 's imports become more expensive in comparison to its exports .
walter said the ecb would not have had to keep its interest rates so high " if we had intelligent players " who understood that big picture .
earn more , spend more the opposing view comes from claus schaefer , an economist at germany 's trade-union think-tank wsi in dusseldorf , who studies how germans share their economic cake .
it was precisely because the world economy was weak that germans needed to earn more and spend more .
" domestic demand can ease the effects of an economic slowing and make a stabilizing contribution during the slowdown phase , " he said in an interview .
" in germany and in other eu nations we have had a very restrained incomes policy .
profits have risen sharply , but wages have stagnated in nominal terms and actually fallen in real terms , " schaefer said .
current pay claims were " a small correction to past inequalities . "
he dismissed fears of a wage-price spiral , which he said had only been seen in post-war germany in the late 1960s and the early 1980s .
deutsche bank 's walter disagreed , saying that boosting domestic demand in times of trouble is only helpful in low-debt economies .
but germany had high public debt and was struggling to provide for an ageing society .
" we have already eaten up our future at breakfast time , " he said .
inflation fears rise in eastern europe in eastern european nations , where the post-1989 change from communism to private enterprise has brought prosperity to many , fears have also been growing among labor groups that inflation will eat up the gains .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 15.09.2008 conductor lorin maazel : masterpieces survive everything großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel said he looks forward to spending more time composing entering his final season as music director of the prestigious new york philharmonic , lorin maazel told dw-world.de about the legacy he leaves behind with the orchestra and his plans to compose and found a new festival . lorin maazel assumed the post of music director at the new york philharmonic , the oldest standing orchestra in the united states , in 2002 and will pass it on to alan gilbert at the end of the 2008-2009 season .
the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.09.2008 opinion : american banks lose more than just money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choked by the credit crisis , lehman brothers , the 158-year-old us investment bank , has filed for bankruptcy .
the crisis underscores how banks have squandered their most prized asset - trust - says dw 's karl zawadzky . trust is the beginning of everything .
and now , mistrust is the end of everything .
this was illustrated dramatically by events on wall street on monday .
trust in the stability of large american banks has evaporated , and mistrust now reigns on wall street as well as in financial districts in london , frankfurt and tokyo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking crisis has now claimed lehman brothers , america 's fourth-largest investment bank .
the institute was founded 158 years ago by german immigrants and recently has posted billion-strong losses quarter after quarter .
in the second quarter of this year , the institution registered a record loss of $ 4 million .
the frantic search for a new cash injection turned out to be in vain . on sunday night , the bank 's management had no choice but to file for chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy filing ever .
that has won the bank a little time to find fresh funds or perhaps to be taken under the wings of another large bank . if that does n't work out , liquidation of a once strong and proud bank is certain .
america 's third-largest investment bank , merrill lynch , has found a savior for now with the bank of america taking over the stricken institution . the shockwaves from reeling us financial markets has pushed global share markets into the red .
there remains no doubt that the international banking crisis has reached a new danger level .
the us government and the federal reserve are no longer prepared to take responsibility for the mistakes of private banks . six months ago , they facilitated the emergency sale of the comparatively small investment bank bear stearns to the financial institution j.p. morgan chase with a massive loan .
they also bailed out mortgage banks fannie mae and freddie mac with the staggering sum of $ 5 trillion .
but now apparently it 's the end of state bailouts or maybe the american state has reached the limits of its financial largesse .
after all , this is about a lot of money . lehman brothers has debts worth $ 613 billion .
of course , the government and the federal reserve will try to avoid a domino effect .
but first it 's up to the private financial sector to step in - not with words but with money .
ten leading international banks , including germany 's deutsche bank , are pooling in $ 70 billion in a fund to help each other with possible cash crunches . lehman brothers , a renowned traditional bank , is in a tailspin .
without a large investor - with really deep pockets - the end of the bank is nigh .
the bank first squandered away its billions and then fell victim to the raging mistrust in financial markets . lehman is n't the first bank to suffer this fate and probably wo n't be the last .
the current banking crisis is the result of too much cheap federal reserve money , endless greed and overly generous banking supervision .
that explains the mistakes and extremes rife in the current financial disaster . germany is also affected by it .
german banks have irresponsibly speculated with bad american mortgages .
but in america , the crisis has a whole new dimension .
the result is n't just a financial disaster but also a political scandal . after the profits have been privatized , the losses are now being nationalized .
even if governments and federal reserves do n't stand by threatened banks , the banking crisis emanating from the us has squeezed the world economy . everybody is paying a price for the wrong acts of some .
in this context , calls for a stronger regulation of the financial sector are understandable .
banks have simply squandered trust .
but let 's not forget that it 's not money but rather the trust of investors and customers that is the most prized asset of banks .
that asset has been severely abused . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more losses are likely , a german economist told dw . dr. michael schroeder is the head of the department of international finance and financial management at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , a non-profit economic research institute in mannheim , germany . deutsche welle : dr. schroeder , how will lehman 's collapse affect europe ? michael schroeder : that question is difficult to answer .
lehman does n't have much systemic risk , or risk with a high probability that it will pull down other banks in its wake .
so i do n't expect the direct counterparts in the banking sector will be hit very strongly . but it is a signal that much greater-than-expected problems in the banking sector are yet to come .
some experts thought one or two months ago that the worse of the subprime crisis was over .
but as we see in the news , this is not the case .
it was very optimistic . world stock markets dropped sharply at the lehman bankruptcy news .
why does the failure of one us bank have such far-reaching financial effects ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says more problems are yet to come i think it has to do with the fact that there still very high losses to come in the near future .
we see that hedge funds , or so-called monoline insurance companies , or other banking institutions could go bankrupt or near-bankrupt by the end of the year - particularly in the us but also perhaps in europe , due to collateral damage in the sector . the expectations are now that high losses could come in the next two or three months .
this will also hurt the business cycle in europe .
but it is difficult to predict to how great an extent ; how strong the impact will be . should consumers in germany be concerned ? well , yes , german consumers should be concerned because the business cycle will be relatively weak over the next year .
but the consumers themselves are part of the problem .
the economy gets weaker , they become more risk averse , then they consume less , and it drives the cycle downwards . ...
germans should consumer more , to combat this cycle . the us government opted not to bail out lehman .
yet the german government recently went to the aid of the ikb bank , when that lender nearly collapsed in the wake of the subprime crisis ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billions of euros were spent bailing out the ikb bank i think bailing out banks or companies has a lot to do with so-called systemic risks .
i do not expect that lehman really will have a strong effect on other banks or banking systems … so the us was right for not bailing out lehman brothers , in my opinion . i also did n't understand why the german government bailed out ikb .
in my opinion it was absolutely unnecessary , and it imposes relatively high costs to the taxpayers in germany . one us analyst is comparing this monday to a certain black monday back in 1929 .
is that realistic ? that is absolutely exaggerated ...
i do n't believe we have an unmanageable , or even an extremely strong , crisis right now .
the stock markets and all the other markets have reacted realistically . there are , of course , very high losses .
but it is not a catastrophe . is there a lesson to draw from this turn of events ? we need a new framework for the banking industry that should be instituted when this crisis is over .
we need clear rules that say when to bail out and when not to bail out a company . politicians should make it clear that banks can go bankrupt . ...
there are many medium size banks that should be allowed to go bankrupt when they have no liquidity anymore . we also need to have a framework for how it should be handled when a bank is bailed out .
managers should n't be allowed to get away with being extremely risk-loving and then not have to pay the price if that strategy fails . when the economy absorbs losses it should be clear who has to pay for these losses .

more losses are likely , a german economist told dw . dr. michael schroeder is the head of the department of international finance and financial management at the center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , a non-profit economic research institute in mannheim , germany . deutsche welle : dr. schroeder , how will lehman 's collapse affect europe ? michael schroeder : that question is difficult to answer .
lehman does n't have much systemic risk , or risk with a high probability that it will pull down other banks in its wake .
so i do n't expect the direct counterparts in the banking sector will be hit very strongly . but it is a signal that much greater-than-expected problems in the banking sector are yet to come .
some experts thought one or two months ago that the worse of the subprime crisis was over .
but as we see in the news , this is not the case .
it was very optimistic . world stock markets dropped sharply at the lehman bankruptcy news .
why does the failure of one us bank have such far-reaching financial effects ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says more problems are yet to come i think it has to do with the fact that there still very high losses to come in the near future .
we see that hedge funds , or so-called monoline insurance companies , or other banking institutions could go bankrupt or near-bankrupt by the end of the year - particularly in the us but also perhaps in europe , due to collateral damage in the sector . the expectations are now that high losses could come in the next two or three months .
this will also hurt the business cycle in europe .
but it is difficult to predict to how great an extent ; how strong the impact will be . should consumers in germany be concerned ? well , yes , german consumers should be concerned because the business cycle will be relatively weak over the next year .
but the consumers themselves are part of the problem .
the economy gets weaker , they become more risk averse , then they consume less , and it drives the cycle downwards . ...
germans should consumer more , to combat this cycle . the us government opted not to bail out lehman .
yet the german government recently went to the aid of the ikb bank , when that lender nearly collapsed in the wake of the subprime crisis ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billions of euros were spent bailing out the ikb bank i think bailing out banks or companies has a lot to do with so-called systemic risks .
i do not expect that lehman really will have a strong effect on other banks or banking systems … so the us was right for not bailing out lehman brothers , in my opinion . i also did n't understand why the german government bailed out ikb .
in my opinion it was absolutely unnecessary , and it imposes relatively high costs to the taxpayers in germany . one us analyst is comparing this monday to a certain black monday back in 1929 .
is that realistic ? that is absolutely exaggerated ...
i do n't believe we have an unmanageable , or even an extremely strong , crisis right now .
the stock markets and all the other markets have reacted realistically . there are , of course , very high losses .
but it is not a catastrophe . is there a lesson to draw from this turn of events ? we need a new framework for the banking industry that should be instituted when this crisis is over .
we need clear rules that say when to bail out and when not to bail out a company . politicians should make it clear that banks can go bankrupt . ...
there are many medium size banks that should be allowed to go bankrupt when they have no liquidity anymore . we also need to have a framework for how it should be handled when a bank is bailed out .
managers should n't be allowed to get away with being extremely risk-loving and then not have to pay the price if that strategy fails . when the economy absorbs losses it should be clear who has to pay for these losses .
the taxpayer should n't always have to pay . interview : mark hallam , jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crisis underscores how banks have squandered their most prized asset - trust - says dw 's karl zawadzky . trust is the beginning of everything .
and now , mistrust is the end of everything .
this was illustrated dramatically by events on wall street on monday .
trust in the stability of large american banks has evaporated , and mistrust now reigns on wall street as well as in financial districts in london , frankfurt and tokyo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking crisis has now claimed lehman brothers , america 's fourth-largest investment bank .
the institute was founded 158 years ago by german immigrants and recently has posted billion-strong losses quarter after quarter .
in the second quarter of this year , the institution registered a record loss of $ 4 million .
the frantic search for a new cash injection turned out to be in vain . on sunday night , the bank 's management had no choice but to file for chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy filing ever .
that has won the bank a little time to find fresh funds or perhaps to be taken under the wings of another large bank . if that does n't work out , liquidation of a once strong and proud bank is certain .
america 's third-largest investment bank , merrill lynch , has found a savior for now with the bank of america taking over the stricken institution . the shockwaves from reeling us financial markets has pushed global share markets into the red .
there remains no doubt that the international banking crisis has reached a new danger level .
the us government and the federal reserve are no longer prepared to take responsibility for the mistakes of private banks . six months ago , they facilitated the emergency sale of the comparatively small investment bank bear stearns to the financial institution j.p. morgan chase with a massive loan .
they also bailed out mortgage banks fannie mae and freddie mac with the staggering sum of $ 5 trillion .
but now apparently it 's the end of state bailouts or maybe the american state has reached the limits of its financial largesse .
after all , this is about a lot of money . lehman brothers has debts worth $ 613 billion .
of course , the government and the federal reserve will try to avoid a domino effect .
but first it 's up to the private financial sector to step in - not with words but with money .
ten leading international banks , including germany 's deutsche bank , are pooling in $ 70 billion in a fund to help each other with possible cash crunches . lehman brothers , a renowned traditional bank , is in a tailspin .
without a large investor - with really deep pockets - the end of the bank is nigh .
the bank first squandered away its billions and then fell victim to the raging mistrust in financial markets . lehman is n't the first bank to suffer this fate and probably wo n't be the last .
the current banking crisis is the result of too much cheap federal reserve money , endless greed and overly generous banking supervision .
that explains the mistakes and extremes rife in the current financial disaster . germany is also affected by it .
german banks have irresponsibly speculated with bad american mortgages .
but in america , the crisis has a whole new dimension .
the result is n't just a financial disaster but also a political scandal . after the profits have been privatized , the losses are now being nationalized .
even if governments and federal reserves do n't stand by threatened banks , the banking crisis emanating from the us has squeezed the world economy . everybody is paying a price for the wrong acts of some .
in this context , calls for a stronger regulation of the financial sector are understandable .
banks have simply squandered trust .
but let 's not forget that it 's not money but rather the trust of investors and customers that is the most prized asset of banks .
that asset has been severely abused . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the second quarter of this year , the institution registered a record loss of $ 4 million .
the frantic search for a new cash injection turned out to be in vain . on sunday night , the bank 's management had no choice but to file for chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy filing ever .
that has won the bank a little time to find fresh funds or perhaps to be taken under the wings of another large bank . if that does n't work out , liquidation of a once strong and proud bank is certain .
america 's third-largest investment bank , merrill lynch , has found a savior for now with the bank of america taking over the stricken institution . the shockwaves from reeling us financial markets has pushed global share markets into the red .
there remains no doubt that the international banking crisis has reached a new danger level .
the us government and the federal reserve are no longer prepared to take responsibility for the mistakes of private banks . six months ago , they facilitated the emergency sale of the comparatively small investment bank bear stearns to the financial institution j.p. morgan chase with a massive loan .
they also bailed out mortgage banks fannie mae and freddie mac with the staggering sum of $ 5 trillion .
but now apparently it 's the end of state bailouts or maybe the american state has reached the limits of its financial largesse .
after all , this is about a lot of money . lehman brothers has debts worth $ 613 billion .
of course , the government and the federal reserve will try to avoid a domino effect .
but first it 's up to the private financial sector to step in - not with words but with money .
ten leading international banks , including germany 's deutsche bank , are pooling in $ 70 billion in a fund to help each other with possible cash crunches . lehman brothers , a renowned traditional bank , is in a tailspin .
without a large investor - with really deep pockets - the end of the bank is nigh .
the bank first squandered away its billions and then fell victim to the raging mistrust in financial markets . lehman is n't the first bank to suffer this fate and probably wo n't be the last .
the current banking crisis is the result of too much cheap federal reserve money , endless greed and overly generous banking supervision .
that explains the mistakes and extremes rife in the current financial disaster . germany is also affected by it .
german banks have irresponsibly speculated with bad american mortgages .
but in america , the crisis has a whole new dimension .
the result is n't just a financial disaster but also a political scandal . after the profits have been privatized , the losses are now being nationalized .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 15.09.2008 conductor lorin maazel : masterpieces survive everything großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel said he looks forward to spending more time composing entering his final season as music director of the prestigious new york philharmonic , lorin maazel told dw-world.de about the legacy he leaves behind with the orchestra and his plans to compose and found a new festival . lorin maazel assumed the post of music director at the new york philharmonic , the oldest standing orchestra in the united states , in 2002 and will pass it on to alan gilbert at the end of the 2008-2009 season .
the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports energy -pipe- 15.09.2008 science edges towards a new generation of biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to biofuels such as ethanol from sugar cane could still help support economies dw-world.de talked to prof. eva-mari aro , an expert on plant physiology and molecular biology at the university of turku in finland , about the current developments in the pursuit of new biofuel technologies . dw-world.de : what are the most viable alternatives to biofuels like ethanol and how do they work ? eva-mari aro : new generation biofuels can be roughly divided into two groups : fuels , which use biomass as a raw material and systems where living organisms -lrb- or biomimicing devices -rrb- produce some liquid fuel , hydrogen or other gas directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide . biomass based biofuels are already close to real application and their breakthrough is mostly dependent on oil price .
however , accumulation of biomass is thermodynamically inefficient process and the conversion of biomass into the form liquid fuel decreases the efficiency more .
biomass has very low efficiency to store energy from sunlight and even in ideal situation they can replace only some percents from fossil fuels .
anyway , they are considered to be a good business when oil prise increases enough . biomass independent systems , in contrast , have very high efficacy in theory , and have real potential to replace fossil fuels .
however , there are still unsolved technical barriers against the real breakthrough of biomass free systems . nowadays ethanol and biodiesel are produced from the same raw materials than food .
this is very inefficient and ethically daunting way for fuel production .
in order to make system more sustainable , the first step is to replace food-based raw materials by more efficient and ethical feedstock .
practically this means organic waste falls , forests and special bioenergy crops and algae . considerable number of research and development is going on in this field .
the idea behind is to convert the biomass into the form of biofuel .
most of the resources are in development of physical , chemical and biochemical processes that can be used to produce biofuels from whatever bulk biomass .
other important area is to explore and develop new plants , which are more suitable for biofuel production as compared to the traditional food crops . agro , forest and oil industry is already involved in developing these systems and they no doubt believe that this will be a business .
indeed , the conversion of bulk biomass into liquid fuels can strongly increase the biofuel production .
however , to be honest , biomass never can replace oil , unless the energy consumption on human population will drop to a fraction of the present one , which will not happen without nuclear war-like catastrophe . the fundamental problem of biomass is that plants store the energy from sunlight into their biomass very inefficiently .
plants are not evolved to be the feedstock of energy production for human activities .
in order to make accumulation of biomass more efficient plants must be pushed to store solar energy many times more efficiently than they do in the nature .
however , plants are so complicated organisms that most probably this will be a mission impossible . as compared to real plants , unicellular algae are simpler and easier to manipulate .
only one type of cell does the all tasks from harvesting the light energy to storage of the energy and for reproduction .
moreover , algae can grow in seawater , which is a great advance when compared to plants . under certain conditions algae can double the biomass in one day and large share of this biomass can be starch or oil , which are easy and energy efficient to convert into form of alcohol or biodiesel .
this means that algae can be much more efficient feedstock for biomass based biofuels than higher plants , particularly for biodiesel formation . the most promising feature of algae is , however , that they can produce molecular hydrogen directly from sunlight and water .
in the nature , this pathway is a kind of emergency valve and function only under very specific conditions .
as such , it has very minor capacity in natural algae .
the existence of this pathway , however , gives a great opportunity to bioscientists to use metabolic engineering in order to make hydrogen production very efficient . what are the benefits of these alternatives ? the main benefit is that there is no competition with food supply .
these alternatives are also very efficient .
in theory , solarbiohydrogen can be a real option for fossil fuels . what effect would the production of these alternatives have on the current production processes of biofuels -lrb- e.g. use of agricultural land , economies in places like brazil , the environment , the alleged contribution to the current food crisis -rrb- ? in general , sunlight is the driving force of the all new systems .
because algae can grow in salt water , the needed water can be pumped from the seas .
when the microalgal solarbiohydrogen systems will be fully developed , indeed , the limiting factor for hydrogen production will be size of bioreactors and availability of solar energy for algal photosynthesis . in present world , there is nearly absolute negative correlation between gdp and high mean daily irradiance .
in the future , when the sunlight will be the main energy source for the need of human beings , the today 's poorest countries will have something that rich countries really are craving .
this means for sure , that new energy business will colonize these poor but very sunny countries in africa and asia . there is no real democracy in these countries , and because of this , there is a risk that the money will flow to the rulers and solar energy money will spread the " middle east " all over central and north africa .
however , if western governments and public organizations monitor the technology transfer , the new energy technology will be a great opportunity to the developing countries . the basic idea of new generation biofuels is not to compete with resources needed to food production .
if in the future the sunny poor countries will be real players in global energy market , it means resources for them .
technology transfer must be linked to the requirements providing that the benefits will be used to modernize the whole society starting from agriculture . would the eu be interested in adopting fuels made from these alternatives or are they focused on ethanol and others ? eu has already a roadmap for a hydrogen economy .
ethanol is not the best solution and the eu knows this .
biodiesel from microalgae is a very attractive option for the eu as well . how easy or hard would it be to produce these alternatives and introduce them into industry and society ? biomass based systems are quite easy .
basically we have the technology , but low energy prices hinder the scaling up of the pilot scale plants .
when the oil price reaches a certain threshold , these technologies will take their part in the energy market . solarbiohydrogen , artificial photosynthesis and other these kinds of more advanced systems are still under development and some fundamental questions need to be solved before commercialisation .
however , the concept is clear and there should n't be anything in this respect that is not possible to solve . what is needed to make the system run is money and smart people .
if industry starts to finance the projects , investments must be a part of their long-term business strategy .
society has to accept genetic manipulation .
in advanced bioenergy field we ca n't do anything without all the tools of modern biotechnology .
anti genetically modified organism -lrb- gmo -rrb- people really should think what the price of banning gmos would be . in general , when massive amounts of hydrogen flow out from bioreactors , everything after that will go fluently .
the transfer from an oil economy to a hydrogen economy is just a set of political decisions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , if western governments and public organizations monitor the technology transfer , the new energy technology will be a great opportunity to the developing countries . the basic idea of new generation biofuels is not to compete with resources needed to food production .

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports energy -pipe- 15.09.2008 science edges towards a new generation of biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to biofuels such as ethanol from sugar cane could still help support economies dw-world.de talked to prof. eva-mari aro , an expert on plant physiology and molecular biology at the university of turku in finland , about the current developments in the pursuit of new biofuel technologies . dw-world.de : what are the most viable alternatives to biofuels like ethanol and how do they work ? eva-mari aro : new generation biofuels can be roughly divided into two groups : fuels , which use biomass as a raw material and systems where living organisms -lrb- or biomimicing devices -rrb- produce some liquid fuel , hydrogen or other gas directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide . biomass based biofuels are already close to real application and their breakthrough is mostly dependent on oil price .
however , accumulation of biomass is thermodynamically inefficient process and the conversion of biomass into the form liquid fuel decreases the efficiency more .
biomass has very low efficiency to store energy from sunlight and even in ideal situation they can replace only some percents from fossil fuels .
anyway , they are considered to be a good business when oil prise increases enough . biomass independent systems , in contrast , have very high efficacy in theory , and have real potential to replace fossil fuels .
however , there are still unsolved technical barriers against the real breakthrough of biomass free systems . nowadays ethanol and biodiesel are produced from the same raw materials than food .
this is very inefficient and ethically daunting way for fuel production .
in order to make system more sustainable , the first step is to replace food-based raw materials by more efficient and ethical feedstock .
practically this means organic waste falls , forests and special bioenergy crops and algae . considerable number of research and development is going on in this field .
the idea behind is to convert the biomass into the form of biofuel .
most of the resources are in development of physical , chemical and biochemical processes that can be used to produce biofuels from whatever bulk biomass .
other important area is to explore and develop new plants , which are more suitable for biofuel production as compared to the traditional food crops . agro , forest and oil industry is already involved in developing these systems and they no doubt believe that this will be a business .
indeed , the conversion of bulk biomass into liquid fuels can strongly increase the biofuel production .
however , to be honest , biomass never can replace oil , unless the energy consumption on human population will drop to a fraction of the present one , which will not happen without nuclear war-like catastrophe . the fundamental problem of biomass is that plants store the energy from sunlight into their biomass very inefficiently .
plants are not evolved to be the feedstock of energy production for human activities .
in order to make accumulation of biomass more efficient plants must be pushed to store solar energy many times more efficiently than they do in the nature .
however , plants are so complicated organisms that most probably this will be a mission impossible . as compared to real plants , unicellular algae are simpler and easier to manipulate .
only one type of cell does the all tasks from harvesting the light energy to storage of the energy and for reproduction .
moreover , algae can grow in seawater , which is a great advance when compared to plants . under certain conditions algae can double the biomass in one day and large share of this biomass can be starch or oil , which are easy and energy efficient to convert into form of alcohol or biodiesel .
this means that algae can be much more efficient feedstock for biomass based biofuels than higher plants , particularly for biodiesel formation . the most promising feature of algae is , however , that they can produce molecular hydrogen directly from sunlight and water .
in the nature , this pathway is a kind of emergency valve and function only under very specific conditions .
as such , it has very minor capacity in natural algae .
the existence of this pathway , however , gives a great opportunity to bioscientists to use metabolic engineering in order to make hydrogen production very efficient . what are the benefits of these alternatives ? the main benefit is that there is no competition with food supply .
these alternatives are also very efficient .
in theory , solarbiohydrogen can be a real option for fossil fuels . what effect would the production of these alternatives have on the current production processes of biofuels -lrb- e.g. use of agricultural land , economies in places like brazil , the environment , the alleged contribution to the current food crisis -rrb- ? in general , sunlight is the driving force of the all new systems .

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports energy -pipe- 15.09.2008 science edges towards a new generation of biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to biofuels such as ethanol from sugar cane could still help support economies dw-world.de talked to prof. eva-mari aro , an expert on plant physiology and molecular biology at the university of turku in finland , about the current developments in the pursuit of new biofuel technologies . dw-world.de : what are the most viable alternatives to biofuels like ethanol and how do they work ? eva-mari aro : new generation biofuels can be roughly divided into two groups : fuels , which use biomass as a raw material and systems where living organisms -lrb- or biomimicing devices -rrb- produce some liquid fuel , hydrogen or other gas directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide . biomass based biofuels are already close to real application and their breakthrough is mostly dependent on oil price .
however , accumulation of biomass is thermodynamically inefficient process and the conversion of biomass into the form liquid fuel decreases the efficiency more .
biomass has very low efficiency to store energy from sunlight and even in ideal situation they can replace only some percents from fossil fuels .
anyway , they are considered to be a good business when oil prise increases enough . biomass independent systems , in contrast , have very high efficacy in theory , and have real potential to replace fossil fuels .
however , there are still unsolved technical barriers against the real breakthrough of biomass free systems . nowadays ethanol and biodiesel are produced from the same raw materials than food .
this is very inefficient and ethically daunting way for fuel production .
in order to make system more sustainable , the first step is to replace food-based raw materials by more efficient and ethical feedstock .
practically this means organic waste falls , forests and special bioenergy crops and algae . considerable number of research and development is going on in this field .
the idea behind is to convert the biomass into the form of biofuel .
most of the resources are in development of physical , chemical and biochemical processes that can be used to produce biofuels from whatever bulk biomass .
other important area is to explore and develop new plants , which are more suitable for biofuel production as compared to the traditional food crops . agro , forest and oil industry is already involved in developing these systems and they no doubt believe that this will be a business .
indeed , the conversion of bulk biomass into liquid fuels can strongly increase the biofuel production .
however , to be honest , biomass never can replace oil , unless the energy consumption on human population will drop to a fraction of the present one , which will not happen without nuclear war-like catastrophe . the fundamental problem of biomass is that plants store the energy from sunlight into their biomass very inefficiently .
plants are not evolved to be the feedstock of energy production for human activities .
in order to make accumulation of biomass more efficient plants must be pushed to store solar energy many times more efficiently than they do in the nature .
however , plants are so complicated organisms that most probably this will be a mission impossible . as compared to real plants , unicellular algae are simpler and easier to manipulate .
only one type of cell does the all tasks from harvesting the light energy to storage of the energy and for reproduction .
moreover , algae can grow in seawater , which is a great advance when compared to plants . under certain conditions algae can double the biomass in one day and large share of this biomass can be starch or oil , which are easy and energy efficient to convert into form of alcohol or biodiesel .
this means that algae can be much more efficient feedstock for biomass based biofuels than higher plants , particularly for biodiesel formation . the most promising feature of algae is , however , that they can produce molecular hydrogen directly from sunlight and water .
in the nature , this pathway is a kind of emergency valve and function only under very specific conditions .
as such , it has very minor capacity in natural algae .
the existence of this pathway , however , gives a great opportunity to bioscientists to use metabolic engineering in order to make hydrogen production very efficient . what are the benefits of these alternatives ? the main benefit is that there is no competition with food supply .
these alternatives are also very efficient .
in theory , solarbiohydrogen can be a real option for fossil fuels . what effect would the production of these alternatives have on the current production processes of biofuels -lrb- e.g. use of agricultural land , economies in places like brazil , the environment , the alleged contribution to the current food crisis -rrb- ? in general , sunlight is the driving force of the all new systems .
because algae can grow in salt water , the needed water can be pumped from the seas .
when the microalgal solarbiohydrogen systems will be fully developed , indeed , the limiting factor for hydrogen production will be size of bioreactors and availability of solar energy for algal photosynthesis . in present world , there is nearly absolute negative correlation between gdp and high mean daily irradiance .
in the future , when the sunlight will be the main energy source for the need of human beings , the today 's poorest countries will have something that rich countries really are craving .
this means for sure , that new energy business will colonize these poor but very sunny countries in africa and asia . there is no real democracy in these countries , and because of this , there is a risk that the money will flow to the rulers and solar energy money will spread the " middle east " all over central and north africa .
however , if western governments and public organizations monitor the technology transfer , the new energy technology will be a great opportunity to the developing countries . the basic idea of new generation biofuels is not to compete with resources needed to food production .
if in the future the sunny poor countries will be real players in global energy market , it means resources for them .
technology transfer must be linked to the requirements providing that the benefits will be used to modernize the whole society starting from agriculture . would the eu be interested in adopting fuels made from these alternatives or are they focused on ethanol and others ? eu has already a roadmap for a hydrogen economy .
ethanol is not the best solution and the eu knows this .
biodiesel from microalgae is a very attractive option for the eu as well . how easy or hard would it be to produce these alternatives and introduce them into industry and society ? biomass based systems are quite easy .
basically we have the technology , but low energy prices hinder the scaling up of the pilot scale plants .
when the oil price reaches a certain threshold , these technologies will take their part in the energy market . solarbiohydrogen , artificial photosynthesis and other these kinds of more advanced systems are still under development and some fundamental questions need to be solved before commercialisation .
however , the concept is clear and there should n't be anything in this respect that is not possible to solve . what is needed to make the system run is money and smart people .
if industry starts to finance the projects , investments must be a part of their long-term business strategy .
society has to accept genetic manipulation .
in advanced bioenergy field we ca n't do anything without all the tools of modern biotechnology .
anti genetically modified organism -lrb- gmo -rrb- people really should think what the price of banning gmos would be . in general , when massive amounts of hydrogen flow out from bioreactors , everything after that will go fluently .
the transfer from an oil economy to a hydrogen economy is just a set of political decisions . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the price for taking the remaining 55 percent in 2011 will depend on brussels airlines ' performance within the ceiling set by monday 's deal . the deal needs regulatory approval as well as support from lufthansa 's supervisory board and the shareholders and board of brussels airlines . brussels airlines was created in 2006 after a merger between the successor to the bankrupt state-owned carrier sabena , sn brussels airlines and discount airlines virgin express . it is one of the few european carriers that does not belong to a major airline alliance .

three years ago , lufthansa bought the ailing swiss carrier , swiss for around 310 million euros .
today , swiss is worth several billion euros . lufthansa allegedly eyeing sas , austrian lufthansa reportedly is also eyeing scandinavian rival , sas in a bid to catch up with its competitor , air france-klm which remains europe 's largest airline . lufthansa , which expects operating profits of 1.4 billion euros in the current year , will have no problems buying sas , which last week was worth around 830 million euros on the stock exchange . the timing for a takeover of sas could not be better either - last year , sas shares plunged by over 60 percent before partially recovering in the last three months . lufthansa is also considered a potential buyer for austrian airlines .

german prosecutors in munich are expected to present many of the same documents and witnesses who described at the italy trial how the germans shot three men and a woman on the first day of the reprisal .

field marshal albert kesselring had ordered brutal reprisals to be conducted on italians if german troops were harmed .
ambush leads to reprisals on june 26 , partisans ambushed a three-man german patrol as it was about to requisition a horse in falzano .
two germans were killed without warning , but the third man got away only slightly wounded and told his fellow engineers .
the company 's lieutenant and his superior , a major in charge of the whole battalion , allegedly decided the engineers should mount a reprisal on the hamlet , which is in the hills making up the " backbone " of the italian peninsula between siena and perugia .
members of company 1 shot up the area , with a german anti-aircraft unit firing over it to scare off partisans .
four people , including a 74-year-old woman , were shot dead purely because they got in the way of the rampage .
later , the italians were forced to watch as charges were placed under their homes in the hamlet and they were blown up .
the men aged 16 to 66 were herded into one house and it was dynamited .
22 witnesses are called in munich , scheungraber is charged with 14 counts of murder with a base motive and the court has set down 11 hearing days up to oct .
21 .
it is likely to be a slow trial : the evidence is old , and hearing days are usually kept short in germany when the accused are elderly .
in total , 22 witnesses and three experts have been summoned .
the first issue will be to decide if the former lieutenant is fit to stand trial .
his former superior has already been ruled too frail to try .
munich lawyers said that the accused 's three-man defense team includes klaus goebel , who some reports link to a charity , the stille hilfe -lrb- silent aid -rrb- , that offered legal and other aid to nazis after the war .

members of company 1 shot up the area , with a german anti-aircraft unit firing over it to scare off partisans .
four people , including a 74-year-old woman , were shot dead purely because they got in the way of the rampage .
later , the italians were forced to watch as charges were placed under their homes in the hamlet and they were blown up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.09.2008 euro-zone workers seek pay hikes amid inflation fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions claim workers have n't gotten their share of recent growth calls for pay restraint as major european economies slip into recession are falling on deaf ears , with workers in numerous countries grumbling that they have gained few of the promised fruits of the last upswing . earlier in september , european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- president jean-claude trichet hammered out a warning against " second-round effects in price and wage setting , " telling euro-zone citizens to put up with high world prices for fuel and food which are beyond governments ' control .
metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .
similar impatience in the working and middle classes amid perceptions that they are slipping back has emerged in britain .
rallies for " fair " pay the labour government 's determination to restrain pay for public-sector workers will be challenged this autumn by teachers and civil servants , who say they are no longer prepared to live on wages eaten up by rising costs for food and fuel .
so far , prime minister gordon brown has argued that low wage demands over the past few years have contributed to economic growth and stability , low unemployment and a rise in living standards .
but after biting the bullet for most of the last 11 years of labour rule , and facing additional challenges from the global economic downturn and the credit crunch , the trade unions are no longer prepared to toe the line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are split on whether higher wages will lead to a wage-price spiral the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- voted this month for " days of action " this autumn in support of higher wages .
rather than strikes , there will be rallies and street protests for " fair pay . "
the tuc could no longer tolerate a sharp drop in living standards for members while the pay packets of bosses were going up by 20 or 30 percent , tuc secretary-general brendan barber said .
warning against pay hikes norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , said in an interview that the danger from pay hikes was real .
if pay were to rise sharply , " the outcome will be inflationary effects in the short term and probably a weakening in growth . "
" pay negotiators do not seem to realize that the terms of trade for nations that import energy and food have worsened , " he said .
declining terms of trade mean that a nation 's imports become more expensive in comparison to its exports .
walter said the ecb would not have had to keep its interest rates so high " if we had intelligent players " who understood that big picture .
earn more , spend more the opposing view comes from claus schaefer , an economist at germany 's trade-union think-tank wsi in dusseldorf , who studies how germans share their economic cake .
it was precisely because the world economy was weak that germans needed to earn more and spend more .
" domestic demand can ease the effects of an economic slowing and make a stabilizing contribution during the slowdown phase , " he said in an interview .
" in germany and in other eu nations we have had a very restrained incomes policy .
profits have risen sharply , but wages have stagnated in nominal terms and actually fallen in real terms , " schaefer said .
current pay claims were " a small correction to past inequalities . "
he dismissed fears of a wage-price spiral , which he said had only been seen in post-war germany in the late 1960s and the early 1980s .
deutsche bank 's walter disagreed , saying that boosting domestic demand in times of trouble is only helpful in low-debt economies .
but germany had high public debt and was struggling to provide for an ageing society .

metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .
similar impatience in the working and middle classes amid perceptions that they are slipping back has emerged in britain .
rallies for " fair " pay the labour government 's determination to restrain pay for public-sector workers will be challenged this autumn by teachers and civil servants , who say they are no longer prepared to live on wages eaten up by rising costs for food and fuel .
so far , prime minister gordon brown has argued that low wage demands over the past few years have contributed to economic growth and stability , low unemployment and a rise in living standards .
but after biting the bullet for most of the last 11 years of labour rule , and facing additional challenges from the global economic downturn and the credit crunch , the trade unions are no longer prepared to toe the line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are split on whether higher wages will lead to a wage-price spiral the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- voted this month for " days of action " this autumn in support of higher wages .
rather than strikes , there will be rallies and street protests for " fair pay . "
the tuc could no longer tolerate a sharp drop in living standards for members while the pay packets of bosses were going up by 20 or 30 percent , tuc secretary-general brendan barber said .
warning against pay hikes norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , said in an interview that the danger from pay hikes was real .
if pay were to rise sharply , " the outcome will be inflationary effects in the short term and probably a weakening in growth . "
" pay negotiators do not seem to realize that the terms of trade for nations that import energy and food have worsened , " he said .
declining terms of trade mean that a nation 's imports become more expensive in comparison to its exports .
walter said the ecb would not have had to keep its interest rates so high " if we had intelligent players " who understood that big picture .
earn more , spend more the opposing view comes from claus schaefer , an economist at germany 's trade-union think-tank wsi in dusseldorf , who studies how germans share their economic cake .
it was precisely because the world economy was weak that germans needed to earn more and spend more .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 15.09.2008 conductor lorin maazel : masterpieces survive everything großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel said he looks forward to spending more time composing entering his final season as music director of the prestigious new york philharmonic , lorin maazel told dw-world.de about the legacy he leaves behind with the orchestra and his plans to compose and found a new festival . lorin maazel assumed the post of music director at the new york philharmonic , the oldest standing orchestra in the united states , in 2002 and will pass it on to alan gilbert at the end of the 2008-2009 season .
the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

metal workers seek pay rise " second-round effects " is an economist 's term for a wage-price spiral : when inflation reduces real pay , workers insist on wage rises to compensate , and prices then rise because of higher labor costs .
workers then ask for another pay rise , and so on .
in germany , the powerful metal-workers union ig metall has said it will seek a wage increase this year of between 7 percent and 8 percent for 3.6 million workers in the industry , its highest demand in 16 years and well above the past year 's 3.3-percent german consumer inflation .
union chief berthold huber said factory profits rose 220 percent from 2004 to 2007 , but workers gained little in the " lop-sided upswing . "
ig metall 's demand is expected to influence pay-bargaining throughout the 15-nation euro zone .
similar impatience in the working and middle classes amid perceptions that they are slipping back has emerged in britain .
rallies for " fair " pay the labour government 's determination to restrain pay for public-sector workers will be challenged this autumn by teachers and civil servants , who say they are no longer prepared to live on wages eaten up by rising costs for food and fuel .
so far , prime minister gordon brown has argued that low wage demands over the past few years have contributed to economic growth and stability , low unemployment and a rise in living standards .
but after biting the bullet for most of the last 11 years of labour rule , and facing additional challenges from the global economic downturn and the credit crunch , the trade unions are no longer prepared to toe the line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are split on whether higher wages will lead to a wage-price spiral the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- voted this month for " days of action " this autumn in support of higher wages .
rather than strikes , there will be rallies and street protests for " fair pay . "
the tuc could no longer tolerate a sharp drop in living standards for members while the pay packets of bosses were going up by 20 or 30 percent , tuc secretary-general brendan barber said .
warning against pay hikes norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , said in an interview that the danger from pay hikes was real .
if pay were to rise sharply , " the outcome will be inflationary effects in the short term and probably a weakening in growth . "
" pay negotiators do not seem to realize that the terms of trade for nations that import energy and food have worsened , " he said .
declining terms of trade mean that a nation 's imports become more expensive in comparison to its exports .
walter said the ecb would not have had to keep its interest rates so high " if we had intelligent players " who understood that big picture .
earn more , spend more the opposing view comes from claus schaefer , an economist at germany 's trade-union think-tank wsi in dusseldorf , who studies how germans share their economic cake .
it was precisely because the world economy was weak that germans needed to earn more and spend more .
" domestic demand can ease the effects of an economic slowing and make a stabilizing contribution during the slowdown phase , " he said in an interview .
" in germany and in other eu nations we have had a very restrained incomes policy .
profits have risen sharply , but wages have stagnated in nominal terms and actually fallen in real terms , " schaefer said .
current pay claims were " a small correction to past inequalities . "
he dismissed fears of a wage-price spiral , which he said had only been seen in post-war germany in the late 1960s and the early 1980s .
deutsche bank 's walter disagreed , saying that boosting domestic demand in times of trouble is only helpful in low-debt economies .
but germany had high public debt and was struggling to provide for an ageing society .
" we have already eaten up our future at breakfast time , " he said .
inflation fears rise in eastern europe in eastern european nations , where the post-1989 change from communism to private enterprise has brought prosperity to many , fears have also been growing among labor groups that inflation will eat up the gains .
tough labor talks are expected in the czech republic this autumn as public and private-sector unions seek an 8-percent pay rise for 2009 .
the czech chamber of commerce called the demand unrealistic .
koruna inflation cut real wage growth to 1.1 percent in the second quarter of 2008 , the lowest in 10 years .

russia 's continued presence in abkhazia and south ossetia remains controversial . the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states are expected to launch a mission of at least 200 civilian observers to georgia in return for a russian military withdrawal .
that follows an agreement brokered by french president nicolas sarkozy - current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency - under which the observers are to deploy by oct .
1 and russia is to withdraw its troops from georgia proper by 10 days later .
officials in brussels say that 11 member states - the baltic states , belgium , britain , france , germany , italy , poland , spain and sweden - have already offered to send personnel and equipment .
but debate remains over the precise wording of the mission 's mandate , with some member states pushing for a specific mention of the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia - now occupied by russia - which says they are independent , and others saying the wording should be more ambiguous , to avoid antagonizing moscow .
trade deal with serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radovan karadzic was arrested in belgrade and handed over to the hague tribunal at the same meeting , the ministers are expected to debate whether they should implement a trade deal with serbia following belgrade 's arrest of war-crimes suspect radovan karadzic in july .
the netherlands say they will not approve the implementation of the deal until the chief prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , serge brammertz , confirms that belgrade is fully cooperating with his organization .
brammertz is expected to attend the meeting .
debate also remains over whether the eu should reward belarus for its decision over the summer to release political prisoners .
some member states say that the eu should send minsk a " strong message " ahead of elections on sept .
28 by lifting sanctions against the regime of president alexander lukashenko .
others say this should be done after the election - making it likely that ministers will content themselves with issuing an encouraging statement .
sanctions against zimbabwe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe , left , and tsvangirai reached a last-minute power-sharing deal turning from incentives to sanctions , eu officials on thursday agreed that the ministers should broaden their current sanctions against zimbabwe in light of the summer 's political violence .
but the news overnight that president robert mugabe and his challenger morgan tsvangirai had reached a power-sharing deal led officials to say on friday that those sanctions could now be delayed .
ministers are expected to approve a letter officially calling for crisis talks with the military junta which seized power in mauritania on aug .
6 .
under article 96 of the so-called cotonou agreement between the eu and african , caribbean and pacific states , the eu could cut off aid to the government if talks are rejected .
finally , the ministers are expected to offer the eu 's support to naval operations against piracy in somalia .
however , the bloc is not expected to launch any mission of its own . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the orchestra recently completed a three-week european tour , making its final stop at the beethovenfest in bonn , where it performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony . dw-world.de : mr. maazel , as you begin your last season with the new york philharmonic , what highlights do you look back on ? lorin maazel : i think many of our world premieres have been very successful .
and i think our cycles - the beethoven cycle , the brahms cycle , the tchaikovsky cycle , and the mahler cycle - have left a certain imprint .
and then our amazing tours - this is our second european tour .
we 've also been to japan and , obviously , the united states . i think the orchestra is a major contender for number one , though i do n't believe in comparisons .
each great artist and great orchestra has its own turf .
but , nevertheless , the orchestra is a stunning ensemble , and i 'm very happy that it 's being recognized for what it is . what do you hope the orchestra will take from you as you go , and what will you take from it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident musicians play better , said maazel i have learned a great deal from the orchestra , especially at a human level .
they 're wonderful , devoted musicians with a very high standard that they set for themselves .
they take a lot of pride in their work and the orchestra and are very proud to belong to the new york philharmonic . in its 168 years of history there have only been 2,000 members , so the turnover has been very low .
in fact , our first clarinet is retiring at the end of this season after having played first clarinet for 60 years , which i believe is some kind of record .
that 's the kind of orchestra it is .
that has been very instructive to me . i think they have had from me a kind of musical discipline and a restoring of their faith in themselves .
they had lost some of that for one reason or another and that was the first task i thought i had : to restore their confidence in themselves .
a confident player plays much better . then i engaged about 25 young players , all virtuosos .
that has brought a virtuosic backbone to the orchestra which is very clearly in evidence .
and i brought down the average age by about 20 years .
so it 's an orchestra full of young people and full of hope and enthusiasm - what the germans call schwung and what the french call e lan . you 're currently the principle conductor of an old orchestra in the new world , so to speak , but you 've also conducted new orchestras in the old world ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny philharmonic toured asia in 2008 , including a historic visit to north korea i have been the music director of the symphonica toscanini and will continue to work with them as a guest conductor .
i have been music director of the opera house in valencia ; i audition the orchestra and will have conducted three full seasons by the end of the 2008-2009 season .
i 'm leaving them as well and i am going to be completely independent and will guest conduct when i want . i have some monster projects ahead of me - especially " 1984 , " my opera .
we 've had more requests now for premieres in various cities of the world than we know what to do with .
so i 'm going to have to organize that as well .
and i 'm finally going to have some time to continue composing .
since finishing the opera -lrb- which premiered in 2005 -rrb- i have not been able to put a note down , which i really regret .
but i have several projects . i 'll also have my own little festival on my estate in virginia - the so-called castleton festival - which i 'm launching on july 4 , our independence day , in castleton , virginia .
it is a chamber opera festival and a mentoring festival , where young players , young singers , young stage directors and young conductors will be mentored by some of the finest musical minds about .
i 'll be devoting a lot of energy to that as well . you 've just performed anton bruckner 's eighth symphony .
what is the appeal of bruckner 's music today ? the appeal of a masterpiece and a master never dies .
i 've noticed this again and again .
we were just in china .
i do n't think the chinese necessarily hear western music every day of the week , at least the way we play it . they were reacting as if the skies had opened up and revealed a book of wonders .
concert after concert was packed with young people .
nobody explained anything to them , but you do n't have to .
a masterpiece can stand on its own . bruckner will continue to have its place and will continue to reach out to people - if it 's performed by people who believe in it .
that 's very important . masterpieces are at the mercy of their interpreters and that 's why i so violently object to these ghastly stagings of great operas to satisfy the quirks and hang-ups and problems and psychological blocks that so many stage directors have .
they use the stage simply to bring forth their own problems .
that 's not why theater functions .
it 's supposed to be there in order to throw into relief the salient points of a masterpiece , perhaps in a different light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maazel succeeded kurt masur at the ny philharmonic when people speak as i do , they 're accused of being conservative .
but if you look at the staging of my opera " 1984 , " it 's hardly conservative - it 's wild , it 's modern , it 's contemporary .
but it 's sane ; it 's healthy .
i think every effort should be made to keep the unhealthy and destabilizing people out of it , because you 're simply doing the mozarts and the beethovens and the verdis and puccinis a great service .
they will survive .
masterpieces survive everything . i 'm not a reformer .
it 's a pendulum .
in five years all these people will be forgotten , but the verdis and puccinis wo n't .
that 's one of the reasons i 'm very keen about my festival .
we have very modern , contemporary stagings of benjamin britten 's operas , which we are now doing in exclusivity for a while .
he was probably the greatest writer of chamber opera of the 20th century .
very modern - but sane and healthy . i hope that with positive statements and by offering alternative stagings , which are healthy and contemporary and appeal to young people , we can make a point that you do n't have to save masterpieces of the past by turning them into unhealthy spectacles . the only thing that 's effective is offering alternative solutions , and that 's what we 're about at the castleton festival in virginia . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two strongest potential buyers appear to have pulled out of talks to rescue lehman - the latest victim of the american credit crisis .
if no new financing comes before wall street opens , it will have to seek " chapter 11 " bankruptcy protection .
this could result in a severe shock to the global financial system , as banks unwind their complex deals with lehman .
late on sunday the us central bank , the federal reserve , announced new moves to ease access to emergency credit for struggling financial companies .
the fed said the step - which broadens the types of securities financial institutions can use to obtain emergency loans - was designed to mitigate the potential risks and disruptions to markets .
in a related move , a consortium of 10 investment banks announced a $ 70bn -lrb- £ 39bn -rrb- loan program that troubled financial companies can use to help ease the credit shortage .
the banks - bank of america , barclays , citibank , credit suisse , deutsche bank , goldman sachs , jp morgan , merrill lynch , morgan stanley and ubs - each agreed to provide $ 7bn -lrb- £ 4bn -rrb- to the pool .
on monday , asian stock markets fell amid concerns over the fate of lehman brothers .
singapore stocks dropped 2.26 % in morning trading and shares in taiwan fell 1.83 % .
markets in tokyo , hong kong , shanghai and seoul were closed for public holidays .
lehman employs about 25,000 worldwide , including 5,000 in the uk .
accountancy firm pwc has already been lined up to run the british operations of lehman should the firm go into administration .
bbc business editor robert peston says uk bank barclays ' decision to walk away from a lehman deal was a huge setback for the effort to rescue the lehman .
barclays terminated the negotiations because it was unable to obtain guarantees in relation to financial commitments faced by lehman when markets open on monday .
bad bank , good bank the rescue effort for lehman was being co-ordinated by the us treasury and the new york federal reserve . "
no other large firm should buy lehman whole - its toxic real estate and securities are too difficult to value " peter morici university of maryland robert peston 's bbc blog the us government had hoped to arrange a bailout under which other us investment banks would finance a " bad bank " that would hold the most " toxic " investments of lehman in the property and mortgage market .
the " good bank " or rest of the firm , including its investment and wealth management arms , would then be sold to another financial institution , for example bank of america or the uk 's barclays .
although such a deal would have cost the other investment banks millions , it might have restored confidence in the sector and avoided a sharp drop in the share price of all banks .
however , it appears that this plan is falling apart .
" the only thing that can prevent lehman collapsing would be a huge injection of taxpayers ' money , " a banker close to the talks told the bbc , but added that us treasury secretary " hank paulson has made it clear he does n't want to do that " .
hard choices bank of america , meanwhile , is said to be unconvinced that buying lehman would be in the interest of its shareholders .
instead , according to a report in the new york times , bank of america is in " advanced talks " to buy investment bank merrill lynch for more than $ 38bn .
have your say " it 's amazing that companies which charge high interest to cover risk still need to be bailed out by the taxpayer . "
jack , canada send us your comments like other us investment banks merrill has suffered losses of tens of billions of dollars in the subprime crisis , and has seen its share price plummet during recent months .
" no other large firm should buy lehman whole - its toxic real estate and securities are too difficult to value , " said peter morici of the business school of the university of maryland .
lehman is up for sale after it reported a $ 3.9bn -lrb- £ 2.2bn -rrb- quarterly loss last week amid concerns over its long term financial viability .
the firm 's share price has plummeted as fears over its future have mounted .
former federal reserve boss alan greenspan said the us government faced " very difficult decisions " over lehman if it could not secure a rescue deal that did not involve public funds .
yet mr greenspan said it would be " unsustainable " for the government to bail out every us bank that got itself into difficulty .
predicting that lehman would not be the last to require rescuing , mr greenspan added that this would not necessarily pose a problem .
" the ordinary course of financial change has winners and losers , " he said .

the two strongest potential buyers appear to have pulled out of talks to rescue lehman - the latest victim of the american credit crisis .
if no new financing comes before wall street opens , it will have to seek " chapter 11 " bankruptcy protection .
this could result in a severe shock to the global financial system , as banks unwind their complex deals with lehman .
late on sunday the us central bank , the federal reserve , announced new moves to ease access to emergency credit for struggling financial companies .
the fed said the step - which broadens the types of securities financial institutions can use to obtain emergency loans - was designed to mitigate the potential risks and disruptions to markets .
in a related move , a consortium of 10 investment banks announced a $ 70bn -lrb- £ 39bn -rrb- loan program that troubled financial companies can use to help ease the credit shortage .

bbc business editor robert peston on the potential implications the banks - bank of america , barclays , citibank , credit suisse , deutsche bank , goldman sachs , jp morgan , merrill lynch , morgan stanley and ubs - each agreed to provide $ 7bn -lrb- £ 4bn -rrb- to the pool .
on monday , asian stock markets fell amid concerns over the fate of lehman brothers .
singapore stocks dropped 2.26 % in morning trading and shares in taiwan fell 1.83 % .
markets in tokyo , hong kong , shanghai and seoul were closed for public holidays .
lehman employs about 25,000 worldwide , including 5,000 in the uk .
accountancy firm pwc has already been lined up to run the british operations of lehman should the firm go into administration .
bbc business editor robert peston says uk bank barclays ' decision to walk away from a lehman deal was a huge setback for the effort to rescue the lehman .
barclays terminated the negotiations because it was unable to obtain guarantees in relation to financial commitments faced by lehman when markets open on monday .
bad bank , good bank the rescue effort for lehman was being co-ordinated by the us treasury and the new york federal reserve .
no other large firm should buy lehman whole - its toxic real estate and securities are too difficult to value peter morici university of maryland robert peston 's bbc blog the us government had hoped to arrange a bailout under which other us investment banks would finance a " bad bank " that would hold the most " toxic " investments of lehman in the property and mortgage market .
the " good bank " or rest of the firm , including its investment and wealth management arms , would then be sold to another financial institution , for example bank of america or the uk 's barclays .
although such a deal would have cost the other investment banks millions , it might have restored confidence in the sector and avoided a sharp drop in the share price of all banks .
however , it appears that this plan is falling apart .
" the only thing that can prevent lehman collapsing would be a huge injection of taxpayers ' money , " a banker close to the talks told the bbc , but added that us treasury secretary " hank paulson has made it clear he does n't want to do that " .
hard choices bank of america , meanwhile , is said to be unconvinced that buying lehman would be in the interest of its shareholders .
instead , according to a report in the new york times , bank of america is in " advanced talks " to buy investment bank merrill lynch for more than $ 38bn .
have your say it 's amazing that companies which charge high interest to cover risk still need to be bailed out by the taxpayer .
jack , canada send us your comments like other us investment banks merrill has suffered losses of tens of billions of dollars in the subprime crisis , and has seen its share price plummet during recent months .
" no other large firm should buy lehman whole - its toxic real estate and securities are too difficult to value , " said peter morici of the business school of the university of maryland .
lehman is up for sale after it reported a $ 3.9bn -lrb- £ 2.2bn -rrb- quarterly loss last week amid concerns over its long term financial viability .
the firm 's share price has plummeted as fears over its future have mounted .
former federal reserve boss alan greenspan said the us government faced " very difficult decisions " over lehman if it could not secure a rescue deal that did not involve public funds .
yet mr greenspan said it would be " unsustainable " for the government to bail out every us bank that got itself into difficulty .
predicting that lehman would not be the last to require rescuing , mr greenspan added that this would not necessarily pose a problem .
" the ordinary course of financial change has winners and losers , " he said .

head teacher posts advertised this year in some 32 % of primary schools , 37 % of special schools and 21 % of secondary schools are unfilled , the naht says .
temporary heads are doing the jobs until permanent replacements are found .
the government says it wants to " attract strong people into leadership positions " in schools .
naht general secretary mick brookes described the current shortage as a " serious and chronic problem " .
he said : " it 's something that the naht has been drawing to the government 's attention for the past three years and it does n't appear to be getting any better .
" with less that three people on average being interviewed for any job and the re-advertising rates being very high across the country as well , it is serious .
" we do n't want it to move into being a crisis situation . "
grooming candidates the government said the union 's figures are based on advertised jobs and the real vacancy rate is around 3 % .
but it admitted the situation could get worse as greater numbers of heads retire soon .
schools minister jim knight said : " we have asked the national college of school leadership -lrb- ncsl -rrb- to look at the issues around how we bring deputies on , how we identify people sooner , how we attract strong people into leadership positions . "
he added that it was important to " make sure , through the qualification that they now have to have , that they will lead good teaching and learning and create the 21st century vision of schools that we want " .
the general secretary of the association of school and college leaders , john dunford , said the figures would not surprise anyone who had followed the demographic trends .
" we know that many heads are reaching retirement age between 2008 and 2011 and that a concerted effort is needed to ensure that there are enough high quality candidates to fill those places . "
" ncsl 's succession planning programme is helping to fill the gap by encouraging more senior leaders to aspire to headship .
" the government must play its part too and do more to address the fundamental issues of increased workload and pressure on senior school leaders . "

he said : " it 's something that the naht has been drawing to the government 's attention for the past three years and it does n't appear to be getting any better .

he added that it was important to " make sure , through the qualification that they now have to have , that they will lead good teaching and learning and create the 21st century vision of schools that we want " .
the general secretary of the association of school and college leaders , john dunford , said the figures would not surprise anyone who had followed the demographic trends .
" we know that many heads are reaching retirement age between 2008 and 2011 and that a concerted effort is needed to ensure that there are enough high quality candidates to fill those places . "
" ncsl 's succession planning programme is helping to fill the gap by encouraging more senior leaders to aspire to headship .
" the government must play its part too and do more to address the fundamental issues of increased workload and pressure on senior school leaders . "

temporary heads are doing the jobs until permanent replacements are found .
the government says it wants to " attract strong people into leadership positions " in schools .
naht general secretary mick brookes described the current shortage as a " serious and chronic problem " .
he said : " it 's something that the naht has been drawing to the government 's attention for the past three years and it does n't appear to be getting any better .

grooming candidates the government said the union 's figures are based on advertised jobs and the real vacancy rate is around 3 % .
but it admitted the situation could get worse as greater numbers of heads retire soon .
schools minister jim knight said : " we have asked the national college of school leadership -lrb- ncsl -rrb- to look at the issues around how we bring deputies on , how we identify people sooner , how we attract strong people into leadership positions . "
he added that it was important to " make sure , through the qualification that they now have to have , that they will lead good teaching and learning and create the 21st century vision of schools that we want " .
the general secretary of the association of school and college leaders , john dunford , said the figures would not surprise anyone who had followed the demographic trends .
" we know that many heads are reaching retirement age between 2008 and 2011 and that a concerted effort is needed to ensure that there are enough high quality candidates to fill those places . "
" ncsl 's succession planning programme is helping to fill the gap by encouraging more senior leaders to aspire to headship .
" the government must play its part too and do more to address the fundamental issues of increased workload and pressure on senior school leaders . "

the muscular dystrophy campaign said its survey showed no specialist care co-ordinator for the 3,000 people with muscle diseases in wales .
it also said 40 % must pay for their own wheelchairs , while such services are readily available in england .
the welsh assembly government said health minister edwina hart would " carefully consider " its findings .
the charity is calling for an urgent review of services across wales .
the survey specifically highlighted the lack of a care co-ordinator in wales as a major cause for concern .
elsewhere in the uk , care co-ordinators act as the first point of call for muscle disease patients , giving them advice and guidance to help find specialist support .
for some families in wales access to specialist care can be a matter of life or death philip butcher , muscular dystrophy campaign a third of welsh patients also have no access to a specialist neuromuscular consultant and 40 % of them have no access to a physiotherapist or feel that they do not receive enough physiotherapy .
the 22 local health boards in wales were also asked to provide information about their services for people with neuromuscular conditions and found that the majority do not support specialist clinics for adults or children .
muscular dystrophy campaign chief executive philip butcher said : " for some families in wales access to specialist care can be a matter of life or death .
" their plight is made worse by the considerable delays and variations in the provision of essential equipment and barriers to living independently .
' complex and confusing ' " it is clear that health and social care services are patchy , complex and confusing .
one woman 's story mother-of-two shawneena laker , 46 , from four crosses , powys , who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy 14 years ago , said : " my condition started to deteriorate about six months and i got to the stage where i was falling over .
" i tried to find out about getting a wheelchair but no-one could help me .
i was told to go to the red cross and they said they could borrow me one for a while but that was no good .
" in the end we had to go to argos in shrewsbury and buy one for £ 250 but i know for a fact that if i lived down the road in pant in england i would have got one for free .
" i think it 's totally disgusting .
i do n't expect to be given something for nothing but this is a terminal illness and my body is breaking down in front of me and i need more help .
" i think there 's a real stigma attached to muscle disease and there 's just no help available here in wales . "
" the report shows that three out of four people in wales are missing out on the vital help of a care co-ordinator , whose role is to support and guide them through the system .
" we are calling on the local nhs commissioners and local authorities to urgently establish additional posts in wales .
" i do know that edwina hart is taking this matter seriously and she has shown a clear commitment to improving standards of care for families in wales . "
on top of a general lack of health services , the survey also found 75 % of families faced financial hardship as a result of muscle disease , with many having to pay for their own wheelchair .
improve services the results come three years after the government 's national service framework for long-term conditions , which pledged to improve quality of life and independence for people living with chronic conditions .
an assembly government spokersperson said the health minister would consider the survery findings , but added : " however , the independent review of neuroscience services , which mrs hart commissioned , will outline proposals on how to improve services across wales .
" this is along with the ongoing work relating to children and young people 's specialist services and the work about to start on neuromuscular diseases .
" she expects that people should see improvements as a result . "
muscle diseases weaken and waste muscles and can be inherited or acquired and affect people of all ages , backgrounds and nationalities .
there are currently no cures available to people with these kinds of conditions .
edwina hart will meet families affected by muscle disease at the muscular dystrophy campaign 's conference in swansea on 13 october .

however , despite their differences in opinion the two groups share the same name - people 's choice .
the government told stoke to change its existing system where the elected mayor and chief executive make all decisions .
it offered it the option of an elected mayor with a cabinet or an elected council leader with a cabinet .
the public will be asked which option they prefer on 23 october .
complex issue the " no " campaign , calling for the elected mayor and cabinet system , is being run by former councillor paul breeze .
current councillor mike barnes , is leading the " yes " campaign , which is calling for a leader and cabinet .
both groups have accused each other of choosing the same name to confuse the public over what is already a complex issue .
if the city votes yes to the elected leader system , it will be installed from may 2009 .
however , if the system is rejected , the elected mayor and cabinet system will be introduced .
the city is currently the only local authority in england to have its existing political system .

current councillor mike barnes , is leading the " yes " campaign , which is calling for a leader and cabinet .
both groups have accused each other of choosing the same name to confuse the public over what is already a complex issue .
