conflicting voices only add to the confusion and contradiction . the beijing summer olympics begin on aug 8 and while the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- hopes that most eyes will be on the sporting prowess on the track and field , no-one is under any illusion that the focus will also be on events outside the glittering arenas .
the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .
but attempting to get a clear view of the current state-of-play is as difficult as peering through the beijing smog on a hazy summer morning .
those looking for evidence of change , whether positive or negative , must rely on the statements of the various parties involved in the human rights debate .
do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up to the beijing olympics has been marked by protests around the world there are tangible examples of minor improvements , however .
after increasing pressure from world leaders and the united nations , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review in 2007 which means that every death sentence must now be heard by the top court .
before that , it was left to the local courts to decide and without strict judicial review there were many miscarriages of justice .
china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .
there will be no censorship on the internet . "
rogge explained that foreign journalists can now travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
" we also realised that there were abuses in the factories making mascots and material for bocog -lrb- the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad -rrb- , " he added .
" the chinese reacted very well .
they arrested those responsible and had a new law passed .
" the third thing was to obtain proper compensation for people dispossessed by the olympic building projects .
the fourth was new legislation for protecting the environment .
on these four points we achieved satisfaction . "
journalists being stymied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups have stepped up criticism of the chinese regime all of these measures sound like definite progress has been made , until one hears from the other side of the argument .
“ this increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story , ” verena harpe , the china expert at amnesty international germany 's asia desk told dw-world.de. harpe said increased mobility for foreign journalists was likely to last only last until after the paralympics in october . she pointed out that correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
" while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented , " she said .
harpe also explained that the people that journalists most want to talk to , usually those most interesting in terms of the situation in china , are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
reports of harassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch relay met with protests amnesty also challenges rogge 's claim that the ioc had helped bring in a law for compensation payments for persons displaced due to olympic construction .
harpe gave the example of a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction .
" he was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions , ” she said .
“ he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october - after the games . "
the reason is that foreign journalists would want to talk to him , harpe said , adding that intimidation and harassment as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
internet censorship continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some internet sites in the press center are blocked rogge 's claim that there would be no censorship of the internet in china also does n't hold water . “ the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was , ” harpe said .
“ even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to ‘ sensitive ' websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them . "
these so-called “ sensitive ” sites which have been shut down include independent new services , blogs attempting to get uncensored news out of china , and international broadcasters which have been deemed dangerous by the chinese government , dw-world.de 's chinese page included .
situation not getting any better amnesty 's harpe believes that behind these claims of progress , the human rights situation has actually worsened , not in spite of the olympics but because of them .
“ in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues , ” she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese police lay low during the olympics ?
to obtain lasting human rights reforms , amnesty international says that governments and olympic committees should move away from the “ quiet diplomacy ” promoted by the ioc and publicly criticize china ; despite claims that to do business with china it has to happen behind closed doors .
“ it is unlikely that the change in the death sentence review would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though public pressure has worked , ” harpe said .
but with the ioc and world leaders like french president nicolas sarkozy unwilling , or unable , to confront china publicly , further improvements - however minor - seem unlikely as the games approach . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .
on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .
they say that it is up to the ioc as the dosb does not have any leverage - since the dosb president thomas bach is also the vice-president of the ioc , we should see very soon whether they are really serious about this . nick amies interviewed verena harpe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .
on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .
they say that it is up to the ioc as the dosb does not have any leverage - since the dosb president thomas bach is also the vice-president of the ioc , we should see very soon whether they are really serious about this . nick amies interviewed verena harpe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to the german olympic sports federation amid a growing debate on human rights as the beijing olympics loom . this weekend , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering called on athletes traveling to the beijing olympics to protest against human rights violations in tibet .
" each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
last week , under the slogan " we are all chinese , " nine german olympians posed in their sports kit for a munich magazine while holding pictures of chinese dissidents in front of their faces .
many of the national olympic committees -lrb- nocs -rrb- have been criticized by human rights groups for their stances on the situation in china and the regulations that some of them have applied to their athletes traveling to beijing as the debate over press freedom and human rights abuses intensifies in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing , dw-world.de spoke to michael schirp , head of the media department at the german olympic s ports federation ’ s -lrb- dosb -rrb- about what 's acceptable and what 's not .
dw-world.de : amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has called for the dosb to clarify its rules on political protests by athletes .
has the dosb taken any action on this or does it believe the rules are clear ?
michael schirp : dosb states that rules have been made clear by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- .
in germany , the dosb has explained the rules both in public and on the german team 's internal olympic web site . generally , athletes are free to say what they think , be it inside or outside of the olympic venues .
they may express their opinions in press conferences or even in the mixed zones , in our “ deutsches haus ” or anywhere else .
there is only one issue that is prohibited according to the ioc charter : the showing of signs , flags , bracelets , pins , banners with political , racial , ethnic , religious content or propaganda if shown inside of areas where an accreditation is needed such as the olympic venues .
apart from that , amnesty international and the dosb have worked together on the subject of human rights since may 2007 .
amnesty international has criticized the dosb for saying that the wearing of wristbands -lrb- ai 's “ gold for human rights ” or the german athletes ' “ sports for human rights ” bands -rrb- are forbidden as they are political statements .
does this ruling still stand ?
what is the dosb 's definition of a political statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german olympic team with president horst koehler i would point you to my first answer .
this is not limited to olympic games .
you 'll find this in any major sport event .
if every political , religious or ethnic conflict in the world would be carried into sporting events , the weight of such statements would be marginalized anyway .
but the most important thing is to keep these conflicts out of the event itself .
sport is intended to build bridges , not to further build walls .
it is only at the olympic games that 205 nocs and the countries they represent come together in a peaceful competition .
what are the dosb guidelines in terms of punishments for athletes who make political statements or protests in beijing ?
we do n't have any of those .
we are sure athletes are aware of their responsibility and have made up their minds regarding human rights in china .
they will find ways to express their opinion or , if they choose , not to , which also has to be respected as their free will .
before the chinese crackdown in tibet , neither the ioc nor dosb mentioned anything about china 's human rights record .
did the tibet situation force the olympic committees to accept that china had a human rights problem ?
to be perfectly blunt , this is just wrong .
before tibet , the media were not interested in sporting organizations which dealt with the issue .
it was in may 2007 , almost a year before the incidents in tibet , that the dosb published a declaration on human rights in china .
this was unique at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against china 's tibet policy marred the olympic torch relay in europe we clearly stated that we consider the situation to be unsatisfactory .
but we are a sport organization and can not solve the problems that the un and others could n't solve for 50 years .
sport is communication , not isolation .
we repeated this during easter 2008 and urged the parties in tibet to stop violence and bloodshed .
again , this was all published .
amnesty international has said that it has held meetings with the dosb to discuss human right .
what has been the outcome of the meetings with ai ?
this was just the start .
cooperation with ai , human rights watch and the human rights spokesperson of the german government continues .
all three of them have met with the team leaders in an attempt to pass on their information to the olympic team .
the team 's internal web site provides all this information .
in addition , every german athlete who goes to beijing carries with him or her material from these human rights organizations and the un . nick amies interviewed michael schirp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .
on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .
they say that it is up to the ioc as the dosb does not have any leverage - since the dosb president thomas bach is also the vice-president of the ioc , we should see very soon whether they are really serious about this . nick amies interviewed verena harpe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to the german olympic sports federation amid a growing debate on human rights as the beijing olympics loom . this weekend , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering called on athletes traveling to the beijing olympics to protest against human rights violations in tibet .
" each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
last week , under the slogan " we are all chinese , " nine german olympians posed in their sports kit for a munich magazine while holding pictures of chinese dissidents in front of their faces .
many of the national olympic committees -lrb- nocs -rrb- have been criticized by human rights groups for their stances on the situation in china and the regulations that some of them have applied to their athletes traveling to beijing as the debate over press freedom and human rights abuses intensifies in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing , dw-world.de spoke to michael schirp , head of the media department at the german olympic s ports federation ’ s -lrb- dosb -rrb- about what 's acceptable and what 's not .
dw-world.de : amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has called for the dosb to clarify its rules on political protests by athletes .
has the dosb taken any action on this or does it believe the rules are clear ?
michael schirp : dosb states that rules have been made clear by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- .
in germany , the dosb has explained the rules both in public and on the german team 's internal olympic web site . generally , athletes are free to say what they think , be it inside or outside of the olympic venues .
they may express their opinions in press conferences or even in the mixed zones , in our “ deutsches haus ” or anywhere else .
there is only one issue that is prohibited according to the ioc charter : the showing of signs , flags , bracelets , pins , banners with political , racial , ethnic , religious content or propaganda if shown inside of areas where an accreditation is needed such as the olympic venues .
apart from that , amnesty international and the dosb have worked together on the subject of human rights since may 2007 .
amnesty international has criticized the dosb for saying that the wearing of wristbands -lrb- ai 's “ gold for human rights ” or the german athletes ' “ sports for human rights ” bands -rrb- are forbidden as they are political statements .
does this ruling still stand ?
what is the dosb 's definition of a political statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german olympic team with president horst koehler i would point you to my first answer .
this is not limited to olympic games .
you 'll find this in any major sport event .
if every political , religious or ethnic conflict in the world would be carried into sporting events , the weight of such statements would be marginalized anyway .
but the most important thing is to keep these conflicts out of the event itself .
sport is intended to build bridges , not to further build walls .
it is only at the olympic games that 205 nocs and the countries they represent come together in a peaceful competition .
what are the dosb guidelines in terms of punishments for athletes who make political statements or protests in beijing ?
we do n't have any of those .
we are sure athletes are aware of their responsibility and have made up their minds regarding human rights in china .
they will find ways to express their opinion or , if they choose , not to , which also has to be respected as their free will .
before the chinese crackdown in tibet , neither the ioc nor dosb mentioned anything about china 's human rights record .
did the tibet situation force the olympic committees to accept that china had a human rights problem ?
to be perfectly blunt , this is just wrong .
before tibet , the media were not interested in sporting organizations which dealt with the issue .
it was in may 2007 , almost a year before the incidents in tibet , that the dosb published a declaration on human rights in china .
this was unique at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against china 's tibet policy marred the olympic torch relay in europe we clearly stated that we consider the situation to be unsatisfactory .

verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .

now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .
on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .
they say that it is up to the ioc as the dosb does not have any leverage - since the dosb president thomas bach is also the vice-president of the ioc , we should see very soon whether they are really serious about this . nick amies interviewed verena harpe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .

dw-world.de spoke to the german olympic sports federation amid a growing debate on human rights as the beijing olympics loom . this weekend , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering called on athletes traveling to the beijing olympics to protest against human rights violations in tibet .
" each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
last week , under the slogan " we are all chinese , " nine german olympians posed in their sports kit for a munich magazine while holding pictures of chinese dissidents in front of their faces .
many of the national olympic committees -lrb- nocs -rrb- have been criticized by human rights groups for their stances on the situation in china and the regulations that some of them have applied to their athletes traveling to beijing as the debate over press freedom and human rights abuses intensifies in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing , dw-world.de spoke to michael schirp , head of the media department at the german olympic s ports federation ’ s -lrb- dosb -rrb- about what 's acceptable and what 's not .
dw-world.de : amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has called for the dosb to clarify its rules on political protests by athletes .
has the dosb taken any action on this or does it believe the rules are clear ?
michael schirp : dosb states that rules have been made clear by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- .
in germany , the dosb has explained the rules both in public and on the german team 's internal olympic web site . generally , athletes are free to say what they think , be it inside or outside of the olympic venues .
they may express their opinions in press conferences or even in the mixed zones , in our “ deutsches haus ” or anywhere else .
there is only one issue that is prohibited according to the ioc charter : the showing of signs , flags , bracelets , pins , banners with political , racial , ethnic , religious content or propaganda if shown inside of areas where an accreditation is needed such as the olympic venues .
apart from that , amnesty international and the dosb have worked together on the subject of human rights since may 2007 .
amnesty international has criticized the dosb for saying that the wearing of wristbands -lrb- ai 's “ gold for human rights ” or the german athletes ' “ sports for human rights ” bands -rrb- are forbidden as they are political statements .
does this ruling still stand ?
what is the dosb 's definition of a political statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german olympic team with president horst koehler i would point you to my first answer .
this is not limited to olympic games .
you 'll find this in any major sport event .
if every political , religious or ethnic conflict in the world would be carried into sporting events , the weight of such statements would be marginalized anyway .
but the most important thing is to keep these conflicts out of the event itself .
sport is intended to build bridges , not to further build walls .
it is only at the olympic games that 205 nocs and the countries they represent come together in a peaceful competition .
what are the dosb guidelines in terms of punishments for athletes who make political statements or protests in beijing ?
we do n't have any of those .
we are sure athletes are aware of their responsibility and have made up their minds regarding human rights in china .
they will find ways to express their opinion or , if they choose , not to , which also has to be respected as their free will .
before the chinese crackdown in tibet , neither the ioc nor dosb mentioned anything about china 's human rights record .
did the tibet situation force the olympic committees to accept that china had a human rights problem ?
to be perfectly blunt , this is just wrong .
before tibet , the media were not interested in sporting organizations which dealt with the issue .
it was in may 2007 , almost a year before the incidents in tibet , that the dosb published a declaration on human rights in china .
this was unique at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against china 's tibet policy marred the olympic torch relay in europe we clearly stated that we consider the situation to be unsatisfactory .
but we are a sport organization and can not solve the problems that the un and others could n't solve for 50 years .
sport is communication , not isolation .
we repeated this during easter 2008 and urged the parties in tibet to stop violence and bloodshed .
again , this was all published .
amnesty international has said that it has held meetings with the dosb to discuss human right .
what has been the outcome of the meetings with ai ?
this was just the start .
cooperation with ai , human rights watch and the human rights spokesperson of the german government continues .
all three of them have met with the team leaders in an attempt to pass on their information to the olympic team .
the team 's internal web site provides all this information .
in addition , every german athlete who goes to beijing carries with him or her material from these human rights organizations and the un . nick amies interviewed michael schirp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , the dosb has explained the rules both in public and on the german team 's internal olympic web site . generally , athletes are free to say what they think , be it inside or outside of the olympic venues .
they may express their opinions in press conferences or even in the mixed zones , in our “ deutsches haus ” or anywhere else .
there is only one issue that is prohibited according to the ioc charter : the showing of signs , flags , bracelets , pins , banners with political , racial , ethnic , religious content or propaganda if shown inside of areas where an accreditation is needed such as the olympic venues .
apart from that , amnesty international and the dosb have worked together on the subject of human rights since may 2007 .
amnesty international has criticized the dosb for saying that the wearing of wristbands -lrb- ai 's “ gold for human rights ” or the german athletes ' “ sports for human rights ” bands -rrb- are forbidden as they are political statements .
does this ruling still stand ?
what is the dosb 's definition of a political statement ?

this is not limited to olympic games .
you 'll find this in any major sport event .
if every political , religious or ethnic conflict in the world would be carried into sporting events , the weight of such statements would be marginalized anyway .
but the most important thing is to keep these conflicts out of the event itself .
sport is intended to build bridges , not to further build walls .
it is only at the olympic games that 205 nocs and the countries they represent come together in a peaceful competition .
what are the dosb guidelines in terms of punishments for athletes who make political statements or protests in beijing ?
we do n't have any of those .
we are sure athletes are aware of their responsibility and have made up their minds regarding human rights in china .
they will find ways to express their opinion or , if they choose , not to , which also has to be respected as their free will .
before the chinese crackdown in tibet , neither the ioc nor dosb mentioned anything about china 's human rights record .
did the tibet situation force the olympic committees to accept that china had a human rights problem ?
to be perfectly blunt , this is just wrong .
before tibet , the media were not interested in sporting organizations which dealt with the issue .
it was in may 2007 , almost a year before the incidents in tibet , that the dosb published a declaration on human rights in china .
this was unique at the time .

verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .

they say that it is up to the ioc as the dosb does not have any leverage - since the dosb president thomas bach is also the vice-president of the ioc , we should see very soon whether they are really serious about this . nick amies interviewed verena harpe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics amnesty international : china has made only minor progress german foreign minister says olympics will " open up " china human rights -pipe- 04.08.2008 beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups say china 's record has worsened in the lead up to the games it is hard to ascertain whether china 's human rights record has improved ahead of the beijing olympic games .
conflicting voices only add to the confusion and contradiction . the beijing summer olympics begin on aug 8 and while the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- hopes that most eyes will be on the sporting prowess on the track and field , no-one is under any illusion that the focus will also be on events outside the glittering arenas .
the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .
but attempting to get a clear view of the current state-of-play is as difficult as peering through the beijing smog on a hazy summer morning .
those looking for evidence of change , whether positive or negative , must rely on the statements of the various parties involved in the human rights debate .
do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up to the beijing olympics has been marked by protests around the world there are tangible examples of minor improvements , however .
after increasing pressure from world leaders and the united nations , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review in 2007 which means that every death sentence must now be heard by the top court .
before that , it was left to the local courts to decide and without strict judicial review there were many miscarriages of justice .
china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .
there will be no censorship on the internet . "
rogge explained that foreign journalists can now travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
" we also realised that there were abuses in the factories making mascots and material for bocog -lrb- the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad -rrb- , " he added .
" the chinese reacted very well .
they arrested those responsible and had a new law passed .
" the third thing was to obtain proper compensation for people dispossessed by the olympic building projects .
the fourth was new legislation for protecting the environment .
on these four points we achieved satisfaction . "
journalists being stymied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups have stepped up criticism of the chinese regime all of these measures sound like definite progress has been made , until one hears from the other side of the argument .
“ this increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story , ” verena harpe , the china expert at amnesty international germany 's asia desk told dw-world.de. harpe said increased mobility for foreign journalists was likely to last only last until after the paralympics in october . she pointed out that correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
" while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented , " she said .

conflicting voices only add to the confusion and contradiction . the beijing summer olympics begin on aug 8 and while the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- hopes that most eyes will be on the sporting prowess on the track and field , no-one is under any illusion that the focus will also be on events outside the glittering arenas .
the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .
but attempting to get a clear view of the current state-of-play is as difficult as peering through the beijing smog on a hazy summer morning .
those looking for evidence of change , whether positive or negative , must rely on the statements of the various parties involved in the human rights debate .
do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up to the beijing olympics has been marked by protests around the world there are tangible examples of minor improvements , however .
after increasing pressure from world leaders and the united nations , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review in 2007 which means that every death sentence must now be heard by the top court .
before that , it was left to the local courts to decide and without strict judicial review there were many miscarriages of justice .
china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .
there will be no censorship on the internet . "
rogge explained that foreign journalists can now travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
" we also realised that there were abuses in the factories making mascots and material for bocog -lrb- the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad -rrb- , " he added .
" the chinese reacted very well .
they arrested those responsible and had a new law passed .
" the third thing was to obtain proper compensation for people dispossessed by the olympic building projects .
the fourth was new legislation for protecting the environment .
on these four points we achieved satisfaction . "
journalists being stymied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups have stepped up criticism of the chinese regime all of these measures sound like definite progress has been made , until one hears from the other side of the argument .
“ this increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story , ” verena harpe , the china expert at amnesty international germany 's asia desk told dw-world.de. harpe said increased mobility for foreign journalists was likely to last only last until after the paralympics in october . she pointed out that correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
" while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented , " she said .

“ this increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story , ” verena harpe , the china expert at amnesty international germany 's asia desk told dw-world.de. harpe said increased mobility for foreign journalists was likely to last only last until after the paralympics in october . she pointed out that correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
" while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented , " she said .
harpe also explained that the people that journalists most want to talk to , usually those most interesting in terms of the situation in china , are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
reports of harassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch relay met with protests amnesty also challenges rogge 's claim that the ioc had helped bring in a law for compensation payments for persons displaced due to olympic construction .
harpe gave the example of a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction .
" he was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions , ” she said .
“ he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october - after the games . "
the reason is that foreign journalists would want to talk to him , harpe said , adding that intimidation and harassment as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
internet censorship continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some internet sites in the press center are blocked rogge 's claim that there would be no censorship of the internet in china also does n't hold water . “ the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was , ” harpe said .
“ even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to ‘ sensitive ' websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them . "
these so-called “ sensitive ” sites which have been shut down include independent new services , blogs attempting to get uncensored news out of china , and international broadcasters which have been deemed dangerous by the chinese government , dw-world.de 's chinese page included .
situation not getting any better amnesty 's harpe believes that behind these claims of progress , the human rights situation has actually worsened , not in spite of the olympics but because of them .
“ in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues , ” she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese police lay low during the olympics ?
to obtain lasting human rights reforms , amnesty international says that governments and olympic committees should move away from the “ quiet diplomacy ” promoted by the ioc and publicly criticize china ; despite claims that to do business with china it has to happen behind closed doors .
“ it is unlikely that the change in the death sentence review would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though public pressure has worked , ” harpe said .

conflicting voices only add to the confusion and contradiction . the beijing summer olympics begin on aug 8 and while the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- hopes that most eyes will be on the sporting prowess on the track and field , no-one is under any illusion that the focus will also be on events outside the glittering arenas .
the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .
but attempting to get a clear view of the current state-of-play is as difficult as peering through the beijing smog on a hazy summer morning .
those looking for evidence of change , whether positive or negative , must rely on the statements of the various parties involved in the human rights debate .
do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up to the beijing olympics has been marked by protests around the world there are tangible examples of minor improvements , however .
after increasing pressure from world leaders and the united nations , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review in 2007 which means that every death sentence must now be heard by the top court .
before that , it was left to the local courts to decide and without strict judicial review there were many miscarriages of justice .
china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .
there will be no censorship on the internet . "
rogge explained that foreign journalists can now travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
" we also realised that there were abuses in the factories making mascots and material for bocog -lrb- the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad -rrb- , " he added .
" the chinese reacted very well .
they arrested those responsible and had a new law passed .
" the third thing was to obtain proper compensation for people dispossessed by the olympic building projects .
the fourth was new legislation for protecting the environment .
on these four points we achieved satisfaction . "

in an interview published monday , germany 's intelligence chief said that osama bin laden , the " che guevara of al qaeda , " no longer personally plans attacks . ernst uhrlau , the head of germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , spoke with bild newspaper reporter monday about terrorism and the bnd 's efforts to combat it .
in the interview , which includes a brief discussion on the recent bombing in istanbul , uhrlau was quoted as saying that he knew that " islamist terrorist " forces were at work in turkey as part of a global jihad movement . those forces , he claimed , were just a part of the al qaeda terrorist network .
al qaeda , he said , is still being run by osama bin laden , who " as far as we know " still resides in the afghan-pakistani border region .
uhrlau , however , no longer sees bin laden as personally planning attacks . instead , uhrlau said , he is " a creative director and icon , something like the che guevara of al qaeda " who helps hold the terror network together . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 , to allow all under-23 players to participate at the olympics . the plea comes ahead of the men 's olympic football tournament , which starts aug .
7 , a day ahead of the official opening of the beijing olympics .
the tournament is open to players under the age of 23 , but three clubs have appealed to the court of arbitration for sport -lrb- cas -rrb- for the return of their players who are already in china . german clubs werder bremen and schalke 04 , as well as barcelona , have approached cas about their players diego , rafinha and lionel messi , respectively . blatter told a news conference at the beijing main press center that whatever the outcome before the world 's highest sports arbitration body , due in the next two days , fifa would tell the players to stay and play . " we are bound by the decisions of cas , but even if it is a decision that is negative for the players , i would say : let them play . " he also said that even with a cas rule in favor of the three clubs , the clubs should allow the players to stay . " the clubs should then say : we were right to appeal to cas , but in the spirit of the olympic games we will let them stay and play , " blatter said . finding a balance between clubs and national teams the soccer head said that he was surprised that these problems had arisen ahead of these games . " in 1988 the fifa congress made the decision that the olympic tournament should be open to players under 23 , " he said .
" since then , we have not had a single complaint or problem with the release of players . " also when the tournament was opened to include three over-aged players , it remained without problems , " blatter added . he said he thought this issue was part of the ongoing problem of trying to combine the interest of clubs with that of the national teams . " we have to find a balance , " he said . at the same time , blatter complimented the english premier league and the italian serie a for releasing all their players , irrespective of whether they were under-23 or not . " we need solidarity in soccer " he said .
" we need everybody to work together .
players should be given the opportunity of playing at the olympics . " he dismissed the argument put forward by some clubs saying that as the olympic tournament was not on the international match calendar , players need not be released for it . " the match calendar deals only with the senior national teams ; it does not mention youth tournament , " he said . revised rules for london ? he also said that the fifa congress in 2006 had decided that the format of the olympic tournament will stay the same for 2008 , but that the issue would be revisited after the beijing games for the 2012 olympics in london . " in england there will also be the issue of one british team instead of four associations which fifa recognizes , " said blatter , referring to fifa 's special dispensation which allows scotland , england , wales and northern ireland to field their own teams in other fifa competitions . " the olympic body will allow just one team , britain , " blatter said . the 72-year-old , who said that this tournament was a special one because it marked 100 years of olympic soccer , thanked the ioc for allowing 12 women teams and 16 men teams to participate . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .
on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .
they say that it is up to the ioc as the dosb does not have any leverage - since the dosb president thomas bach is also the vice-president of the ioc , we should see very soon whether they are really serious about this . nick amies interviewed verena harpe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .

verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .

in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .
on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .
they say that it is up to the ioc as the dosb does not have any leverage - since the dosb president thomas bach is also the vice-president of the ioc , we should see very soon whether they are really serious about this . nick amies interviewed verena harpe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to the german olympic sports federation amid a growing debate on human rights as the beijing olympics loom . this weekend , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering called on athletes traveling to the beijing olympics to protest against human rights violations in tibet .
" each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
last week , under the slogan " we are all chinese , " nine german olympians posed in their sports kit for a munich magazine while holding pictures of chinese dissidents in front of their faces .
many of the national olympic committees -lrb- nocs -rrb- have been criticized by human rights groups for their stances on the situation in china and the regulations that some of them have applied to their athletes traveling to beijing as the debate over press freedom and human rights abuses intensifies in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing , dw-world.de spoke to michael schirp , head of the media department at the german olympic s ports federation ’ s -lrb- dosb -rrb- about what 's acceptable and what 's not .
dw-world.de : amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has called for the dosb to clarify its rules on political protests by athletes .
has the dosb taken any action on this or does it believe the rules are clear ?
michael schirp : dosb states that rules have been made clear by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- .
in germany , the dosb has explained the rules both in public and on the german team 's internal olympic web site . generally , athletes are free to say what they think , be it inside or outside of the olympic venues .
they may express their opinions in press conferences or even in the mixed zones , in our “ deutsches haus ” or anywhere else .
there is only one issue that is prohibited according to the ioc charter : the showing of signs , flags , bracelets , pins , banners with political , racial , ethnic , religious content or propaganda if shown inside of areas where an accreditation is needed such as the olympic venues .
apart from that , amnesty international and the dosb have worked together on the subject of human rights since may 2007 .
amnesty international has criticized the dosb for saying that the wearing of wristbands -lrb- ai 's “ gold for human rights ” or the german athletes ' “ sports for human rights ” bands -rrb- are forbidden as they are political statements .
does this ruling still stand ?
what is the dosb 's definition of a political statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german olympic team with president horst koehler i would point you to my first answer .
this is not limited to olympic games .
you 'll find this in any major sport event .
if every political , religious or ethnic conflict in the world would be carried into sporting events , the weight of such statements would be marginalized anyway .
but the most important thing is to keep these conflicts out of the event itself .
sport is intended to build bridges , not to further build walls .
it is only at the olympic games that 205 nocs and the countries they represent come together in a peaceful competition .
what are the dosb guidelines in terms of punishments for athletes who make political statements or protests in beijing ?
we do n't have any of those .
we are sure athletes are aware of their responsibility and have made up their minds regarding human rights in china .
they will find ways to express their opinion or , if they choose , not to , which also has to be respected as their free will .
before the chinese crackdown in tibet , neither the ioc nor dosb mentioned anything about china 's human rights record .
did the tibet situation force the olympic committees to accept that china had a human rights problem ?
to be perfectly blunt , this is just wrong .
before tibet , the media were not interested in sporting organizations which dealt with the issue .
it was in may 2007 , almost a year before the incidents in tibet , that the dosb published a declaration on human rights in china .
this was unique at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against china 's tibet policy marred the olympic torch relay in europe we clearly stated that we consider the situation to be unsatisfactory .
but we are a sport organization and can not solve the problems that the un and others could n't solve for 50 years .

we repeated this during easter 2008 and urged the parties in tibet to stop violence and bloodshed .

what is the dosb 's definition of a political statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german olympic team with president horst koehler i would point you to my first answer .
this is not limited to olympic games .
you 'll find this in any major sport event .
if every political , religious or ethnic conflict in the world would be carried into sporting events , the weight of such statements would be marginalized anyway .
but the most important thing is to keep these conflicts out of the event itself .
sport is intended to build bridges , not to further build walls .
it is only at the olympic games that 205 nocs and the countries they represent come together in a peaceful competition .
what are the dosb guidelines in terms of punishments for athletes who make political statements or protests in beijing ?
we do n't have any of those .
we are sure athletes are aware of their responsibility and have made up their minds regarding human rights in china .
they will find ways to express their opinion or , if they choose , not to , which also has to be respected as their free will .
before the chinese crackdown in tibet , neither the ioc nor dosb mentioned anything about china 's human rights record .
did the tibet situation force the olympic committees to accept that china had a human rights problem ?
to be perfectly blunt , this is just wrong .
before tibet , the media were not interested in sporting organizations which dealt with the issue .
it was in may 2007 , almost a year before the incidents in tibet , that the dosb published a declaration on human rights in china .

dw-world.de : amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has called for the dosb to clarify its rules on political protests by athletes .
has the dosb taken any action on this or does it believe the rules are clear ?
michael schirp : dosb states that rules have been made clear by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- .
in germany , the dosb has explained the rules both in public and on the german team 's internal olympic web site . generally , athletes are free to say what they think , be it inside or outside of the olympic venues .
they may express their opinions in press conferences or even in the mixed zones , in our “ deutsches haus ” or anywhere else .
there is only one issue that is prohibited according to the ioc charter : the showing of signs , flags , bracelets , pins , banners with political , racial , ethnic , religious content or propaganda if shown inside of areas where an accreditation is needed such as the olympic venues .
apart from that , amnesty international and the dosb have worked together on the subject of human rights since may 2007 .

but can the military help cut crime ? the controversial deployment of nearly 3,000 troops throughout italy was introduced by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right government as a move that would help combat crime .
the government , which took office in april after berlusconi successfully campaigned on a law-and-order platform , has linked crime and illegal immigration and passed a series of measures aimed at cracking down on both .
to that end , the government began a six-month deployment of hundreds of troops who now join local police forces in urban centers like rome , naples , and milan , according to press reports from those cities .
another 1,000 of the troops went to embassies , railway stations , churches , and other sensitive places where tourists tend to congregate .
the soldiers there have been authorized to only make arrests when they catch people actually committing a crime .
the remaining third have been sent to guard holding centers for illegal immigrants .
on the island of lampedusa , where thousands of migrants have arrived from africa in recent months seeking to enter europe , 70 air force troops were supplementing police who patrol the perimeter of a reception center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops were likewise deployed to the immigrant holding center at lampedusa claims of increased security have opposition crying foul interior minister roberto maroni of the anti-immigrant northern league said he wants to " give the public a better perception of security . "
opposition leaders have criticized the move , however , labeling it as " propaganda " and questioning its effectiveness in combating crime .
they have argued instead that more funds and other resources should have been provided to the police .
a union representing the police , coisp , also slammed the decision , and in a statement welcomed the fact that no soldiers are to be deployed in venice .
" we 're off the hook -lrb- in venice -rrb- because for every three soldiers deployed , one police or carabinieri -lrb- paramilitary police -rrb- needs to be provided as backup , " coisp said in a statement .
" where are we going to find extra police ? "
coisp asked , lamenting what it said was a scarcity of fuel for police squad cars and a lack of overtime pay for police officers .

he said he feared that the " militarization " of the capital would scare away visitors .
officials , however , downplayed the decision to draft in troops .
" in 1992 , 20,000 men were sent to sicily alone " to aid police in fighting the mafia after the murder of two judges , deputy chief of the general staff general mario buscemi was quoted by daily la repubblica as saying .

the government , which took office in april after berlusconi successfully campaigned on a law-and-order platform , has linked crime and illegal immigration and passed a series of measures aimed at cracking down on both .
to that end , the government began a six-month deployment of hundreds of troops who now join local police forces in urban centers like rome , naples , and milan , according to press reports from those cities .
another 1,000 of the troops went to embassies , railway stations , churches , and other sensitive places where tourists tend to congregate .
the soldiers there have been authorized to only make arrests when they catch people actually committing a crime .

" companies ' expectations for the next six months are terribly bad , " carstensen said .
though order books are full right now , there are no new orders , carstensen warned .
" the upturn will definitely be over in winter .
many companies will gradually start cutting back on production and also lay off staff . "
the newspaper reported that german companies rated their order situation to be the worst in two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal industry is worried about getting new orders germany 's engineering and electronics employer group , gesamtmetall also voiced worries about the effects of a cooling global economy .
" the global economic slowdown is increasingly affecting the metal and electronics industry , " gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser told bild .
" in many companies , there 's enough work to last only until the end of the year . "
" heading towards zero " the news comes on the heels of top german carmakers showing signs of suffering from the global downturn .
last friday , bmw said it would miss its 2008 targets , following rival daimler with a profit warning as soaring oil and raw materials costs combined with a faltering us economy begin to bite the auto sector .
" the downturn will last longer and hit harder than companies have so far assumed , " deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter told newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag on the weekend .
" on the labor market , there will be bad news during the whole of 2009 . "
german joblessness fell by 20,000 on the month in july to 3.250 million .
however , economists say falling unemployment will soon be overtaken by developments in the broader economy and warn that the buoyancy of the labor market will not last .
buffeted by the global credit crisis , a weakening us economy and soaring prices for oil and raw materials , the clouds over the german economy have grown since the start of the year .
" the idea that we can continue to grow briskly with the few countries that are ticking along is unrealistic , in light of the numerous countries that are no longer ticking along , " walter told tagesspiegel am sonntag .
" for years we had double-digit growth rates in exports , now we are heading towards zero , " he added .
growth slower in euro zone than in the us analysts have already begun reversing downward their growth projections for europe 's largest economy .
the german finance ministry said last week that german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrank considerably in the second quarter after a strong start to the year , when europe 's largest economy expanded at its fastest rate since 1996 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retail sales in germany have fallen amid a downbeat mood among consumers german business daily handelsblatt said that based on a survey of 10 leading german and international banks and research institutes , big german companies will have to reckon with shrinking profits this year .
hopes that europe could isolate itself from the economic crisis in the us have evaporated , the paper said .
instead , current forecasts show that both economic growth and rise in profits in the euro zone in 2008 may be slower than in the us , the paper said .
the experts surveyed by the paper expect growth of just 0.9 percent in the euro zone for next year as against 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2.7 percent in 2007 .
in june , the european central bank had forecast a growth rate of 1.5 percent for the euro zone in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics amnesty international : china has made only minor progress german foreign minister says olympics will " open up " china human rights -pipe- 04.08.2008 beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups say china 's record has worsened in the lead up to the games it is hard to ascertain whether china 's human rights record has improved ahead of the beijing olympic games .
conflicting voices only add to the confusion and contradiction . the beijing summer olympics begin on aug 8 and while the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- hopes that most eyes will be on the sporting prowess on the track and field , no-one is under any illusion that the focus will also be on events outside the glittering arenas .
the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .
but attempting to get a clear view of the current state-of-play is as difficult as peering through the beijing smog on a hazy summer morning .
those looking for evidence of change , whether positive or negative , must rely on the statements of the various parties involved in the human rights debate .
do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up to the beijing olympics has been marked by protests around the world there are tangible examples of minor improvements , however .
after increasing pressure from world leaders and the united nations , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review in 2007 which means that every death sentence must now be heard by the top court .
before that , it was left to the local courts to decide and without strict judicial review there were many miscarriages of justice .
china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .

“ he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october - after the games . "

“ even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to ‘ sensitive ' websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them . "

conflicting voices only add to the confusion and contradiction . the beijing summer olympics begin on aug 8 and while the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- hopes that most eyes will be on the sporting prowess on the track and field , no-one is under any illusion that the focus will also be on events outside the glittering arenas .
the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .
but attempting to get a clear view of the current state-of-play is as difficult as peering through the beijing smog on a hazy summer morning .
those looking for evidence of change , whether positive or negative , must rely on the statements of the various parties involved in the human rights debate .
do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up to the beijing olympics has been marked by protests around the world there are tangible examples of minor improvements , however .
after increasing pressure from world leaders and the united nations , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review in 2007 which means that every death sentence must now be heard by the top court .
before that , it was left to the local courts to decide and without strict judicial review there were many miscarriages of justice .
china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .
there will be no censorship on the internet . "
rogge explained that foreign journalists can now travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .

however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .
there will be no censorship on the internet . "
rogge explained that foreign journalists can now travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
" we also realised that there were abuses in the factories making mascots and material for bocog -lrb- the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad -rrb- , " he added .
" the chinese reacted very well .
they arrested those responsible and had a new law passed .
" the third thing was to obtain proper compensation for people dispossessed by the olympic building projects .
the fourth was new legislation for protecting the environment .
on these four points we achieved satisfaction . "
journalists being stymied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups have stepped up criticism of the chinese regime all of these measures sound like definite progress has been made , until one hears from the other side of the argument .
“ this increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story , ” verena harpe , the china expert at amnesty international germany 's asia desk told dw-world.de. harpe said increased mobility for foreign journalists was likely to last only last until after the paralympics in october . she pointed out that correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
" while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented , " she said .
harpe also explained that the people that journalists most want to talk to , usually those most interesting in terms of the situation in china , are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
reports of harassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch relay met with protests amnesty also challenges rogge 's claim that the ioc had helped bring in a law for compensation payments for persons displaced due to olympic construction .
harpe gave the example of a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction .
" he was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions , ” she said .
“ he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october - after the games . "
the reason is that foreign journalists would want to talk to him , harpe said , adding that intimidation and harassment as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
internet censorship continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some internet sites in the press center are blocked rogge 's claim that there would be no censorship of the internet in china also does n't hold water . “ the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was , ” harpe said .
“ even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to ‘ sensitive ' websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them . "
these so-called “ sensitive ” sites which have been shut down include independent new services , blogs attempting to get uncensored news out of china , and international broadcasters which have been deemed dangerous by the chinese government , dw-world.de 's chinese page included .
situation not getting any better amnesty 's harpe believes that behind these claims of progress , the human rights situation has actually worsened , not in spite of the olympics but because of them .
“ in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues , ” she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese police lay low during the olympics ?
to obtain lasting human rights reforms , amnesty international says that governments and olympic committees should move away from the “ quiet diplomacy ” promoted by the ioc and publicly criticize china ; despite claims that to do business with china it has to happen behind closed doors .
“ it is unlikely that the change in the death sentence review would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though public pressure has worked , ” harpe said .

conflicting voices only add to the confusion and contradiction . the beijing summer olympics begin on aug 8 and while the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- hopes that most eyes will be on the sporting prowess on the track and field , no-one is under any illusion that the focus will also be on events outside the glittering arenas .
the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .
but attempting to get a clear view of the current state-of-play is as difficult as peering through the beijing smog on a hazy summer morning .
those looking for evidence of change , whether positive or negative , must rely on the statements of the various parties involved in the human rights debate .
do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up to the beijing olympics has been marked by protests around the world there are tangible examples of minor improvements , however .
after increasing pressure from world leaders and the united nations , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review in 2007 which means that every death sentence must now be heard by the top court .
before that , it was left to the local courts to decide and without strict judicial review there were many miscarriages of justice .
china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .

german politicians are calling for a comprehensive , nationwide law against smoking on the heels of the recent ruling by the german constitutional court to partially overturn bans in several german states . after years of dragging its feet on implementing a smoking ban , germany went smoke-free in bars and restaurants this year in a move that has both raised hackles and won praise .
so last wednesday 's court ruling , which found that individual state laws allowing bars to set up separate smoking and non-smoking areas gave large multi-room pubs an advantage over smaller one-room pubs , was one that was met with fierce debate . renate kuenast , the parliamentary co-leader of the opposition green party , criticized the federal government in comments on the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel on sunday .
" it was an act of cowardice to leave protection of non-smokers up to the states , " kuenast said . germans in favor of federal rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rule reversal now allows smoking in one-room pubs that 's a sentiment that many germans are echoing .
in a survey by the emnid institute that was published in the bild am sonntag newspaper sunday , some 81 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of the federal government setting rules on smoking in bars and restaurants instead of ceding responsibility to the states . even so , the bild survey showed a lack of agreement as to what those rules should be .
some 20 percent of respondents opposed a ban while 56 percent supported a smoking ban with exceptions – such as for small corner pubs .
just 23 percent wanted all bars and restaurants to be smoke-free . still , kuenast said that the green party would seek a nationwide ban on the basis of worker safety , which is regulated by the federal government . as the laws stand now , each state has been able to devise its own regulations against smoking .
in bavaria , that means smokers get a reprieve during the state 's annual oktoberfest , when the beer tents synonymous with the festival become smoking zones . calls for consistency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer tents at oktoberfest : still a smoking zone .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , premier of the german state of hesse , said , however , that the states themselves could develop their own comprehensive smoking ban and he 's promised to put that issue on the agenda of the next meeting of state premiers in dresden in october .
" it is sensible for the states to reach as much of an amicable consensus on non-smoker protection as possible and to prevent a patchwork of regulations across the country , " koch said .
" we should also agree not to turn this into a political debate . " marlies volkmer , the social democratic spokeswoman for the german parliament 's committee for nutrition , agriculture and consumer protection , agreed . " the state parliaments are now called upon to use their discretion in order to impose a general smoking ban , " she said .

german politicians are calling for a comprehensive , nationwide law against smoking on the heels of the recent ruling by the german constitutional court to partially overturn bans in several german states . after years of dragging its feet on implementing a smoking ban , germany went smoke-free in bars and restaurants this year in a move that has both raised hackles and won praise .
so last wednesday 's court ruling , which found that individual state laws allowing bars to set up separate smoking and non-smoking areas gave large multi-room pubs an advantage over smaller one-room pubs , was one that was met with fierce debate . renate kuenast , the parliamentary co-leader of the opposition green party , criticized the federal government in comments on the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel on sunday .
" it was an act of cowardice to leave protection of non-smokers up to the states , " kuenast said . germans in favor of federal rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rule reversal now allows smoking in one-room pubs that 's a sentiment that many germans are echoing .
in a survey by the emnid institute that was published in the bild am sonntag newspaper sunday , some 81 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of the federal government setting rules on smoking in bars and restaurants instead of ceding responsibility to the states . even so , the bild survey showed a lack of agreement as to what those rules should be .
some 20 percent of respondents opposed a ban while 56 percent supported a smoking ban with exceptions – such as for small corner pubs .
just 23 percent wanted all bars and restaurants to be smoke-free . still , kuenast said that the green party would seek a nationwide ban on the basis of worker safety , which is regulated by the federal government . as the laws stand now , each state has been able to devise its own regulations against smoking .
in bavaria , that means smokers get a reprieve during the state 's annual oktoberfest , when the beer tents synonymous with the festival become smoking zones . calls for consistency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer tents at oktoberfest : still a smoking zone .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , premier of the german state of hesse , said , however , that the states themselves could develop their own comprehensive smoking ban and he 's promised to put that issue on the agenda of the next meeting of state premiers in dresden in october .
" it is sensible for the states to reach as much of an amicable consensus on non-smoker protection as possible and to prevent a patchwork of regulations across the country , " koch said .
" we should also agree not to turn this into a political debate . " marlies volkmer , the social democratic spokeswoman for the german parliament 's committee for nutrition , agriculture and consumer protection , agreed . " the state parliaments are now called upon to use their discretion in order to impose a general smoking ban , " she said .

as a result of a maintenance backlog due to ground crew strike , some 130 flights were slated to be canceled on monday , aug .

a pilot 's strike would further hinder the airline 's efforts to get back to a normal flight schedule .

cityline , eurowings pilots could join some 1,100 pilots at lufthansa subsidiaries cityline and eurowings could also join in the strikes .
they are demanding compensation for the lack of a pay hike in last years ' negotiations , as well as appropriate shares in company results .

conflicting voices only add to the confusion and contradiction . the beijing summer olympics begin on aug 8 and while the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- hopes that most eyes will be on the sporting prowess on the track and field , no-one is under any illusion that the focus will also be on events outside the glittering arenas .
the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .
but attempting to get a clear view of the current state-of-play is as difficult as peering through the beijing smog on a hazy summer morning .
those looking for evidence of change , whether positive or negative , must rely on the statements of the various parties involved in the human rights debate .
do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up to the beijing olympics has been marked by protests around the world there are tangible examples of minor improvements , however .
after increasing pressure from world leaders and the united nations , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review in 2007 which means that every death sentence must now be heard by the top court .
before that , it was left to the local courts to decide and without strict judicial review there were many miscarriages of justice .
china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .
there will be no censorship on the internet . "
rogge explained that foreign journalists can now travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
" we also realised that there were abuses in the factories making mascots and material for bocog -lrb- the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad -rrb- , " he added .
" the chinese reacted very well .
they arrested those responsible and had a new law passed .
" the third thing was to obtain proper compensation for people dispossessed by the olympic building projects .
the fourth was new legislation for protecting the environment .
on these four points we achieved satisfaction . "
journalists being stymied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups have stepped up criticism of the chinese regime all of these measures sound like definite progress has been made , until one hears from the other side of the argument .
“ this increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story , ” verena harpe , the china expert at amnesty international germany 's asia desk told dw-world.de. harpe said increased mobility for foreign journalists was likely to last only last until after the paralympics in october . she pointed out that correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
" while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented , " she said .
harpe also explained that the people that journalists most want to talk to , usually those most interesting in terms of the situation in china , are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
reports of harassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch relay met with protests amnesty also challenges rogge 's claim that the ioc had helped bring in a law for compensation payments for persons displaced due to olympic construction .
harpe gave the example of a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction .
" he was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions , ” she said .
“ he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october - after the games . "
the reason is that foreign journalists would want to talk to him , harpe said , adding that intimidation and harassment as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
internet censorship continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some internet sites in the press center are blocked rogge 's claim that there would be no censorship of the internet in china also does n't hold water . “ the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was , ” harpe said .
“ even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to ‘ sensitive ' websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them . "
these so-called “ sensitive ” sites which have been shut down include independent new services , blogs attempting to get uncensored news out of china , and international broadcasters which have been deemed dangerous by the chinese government , dw-world.de 's chinese page included .
situation not getting any better amnesty 's harpe believes that behind these claims of progress , the human rights situation has actually worsened , not in spite of the olympics but because of them .
“ in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues , ” she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese police lay low during the olympics ?
to obtain lasting human rights reforms , amnesty international says that governments and olympic committees should move away from the “ quiet diplomacy ” promoted by the ioc and publicly criticize china ; despite claims that to do business with china it has to happen behind closed doors .
“ it is unlikely that the change in the death sentence review would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though public pressure has worked , ” harpe said .
but with the ioc and world leaders like french president nicolas sarkozy unwilling , or unable , to confront china publicly , further improvements - however minor - seem unlikely as the games approach . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

conflicting voices only add to the confusion and contradiction . the beijing summer olympics begin on aug 8 and while the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- hopes that most eyes will be on the sporting prowess on the track and field , no-one is under any illusion that the focus will also be on events outside the glittering arenas .
the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .
but attempting to get a clear view of the current state-of-play is as difficult as peering through the beijing smog on a hazy summer morning .
those looking for evidence of change , whether positive or negative , must rely on the statements of the various parties involved in the human rights debate .
do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up to the beijing olympics has been marked by protests around the world there are tangible examples of minor improvements , however .
after increasing pressure from world leaders and the united nations , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review in 2007 which means that every death sentence must now be heard by the top court .
before that , it was left to the local courts to decide and without strict judicial review there were many miscarriages of justice .
china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .
there will be no censorship on the internet . "
rogge explained that foreign journalists can now travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
" we also realised that there were abuses in the factories making mascots and material for bocog -lrb- the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad -rrb- , " he added .
" the chinese reacted very well .
they arrested those responsible and had a new law passed .
" the third thing was to obtain proper compensation for people dispossessed by the olympic building projects .
the fourth was new legislation for protecting the environment .
on these four points we achieved satisfaction . "

verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .
on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .
they say that it is up to the ioc as the dosb does not have any leverage - since the dosb president thomas bach is also the vice-president of the ioc , we should see very soon whether they are really serious about this . nick amies interviewed verena harpe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" companies ' expectations for the next six months are terribly bad , " carstensen said .
though order books are full right now , there are no new orders , carstensen warned .
" the upturn will definitely be over in winter .
many companies will gradually start cutting back on production and also lay off staff . "
the newspaper reported that german companies rated their order situation to be the worst in two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal industry is worried about getting new orders germany 's engineering and electronics employer group , gesamtmetall also voiced worries about the effects of a cooling global economy .
" the global economic slowdown is increasingly affecting the metal and electronics industry , " gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser told bild .
" in many companies , there 's enough work to last only until the end of the year . "
" heading towards zero " the news comes on the heels of top german carmakers showing signs of suffering from the global downturn .
last friday , bmw said it would miss its 2008 targets , following rival daimler with a profit warning as soaring oil and raw materials costs combined with a faltering us economy begin to bite the auto sector .
" the downturn will last longer and hit harder than companies have so far assumed , " deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter told newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag on the weekend .
" on the labor market , there will be bad news during the whole of 2009 . "
german joblessness fell by 20,000 on the month in july to 3.250 million .
however , economists say falling unemployment will soon be overtaken by developments in the broader economy and warn that the buoyancy of the labor market will not last .
buffeted by the global credit crisis , a weakening us economy and soaring prices for oil and raw materials , the clouds over the german economy have grown since the start of the year .
" the idea that we can continue to grow briskly with the few countries that are ticking along is unrealistic , in light of the numerous countries that are no longer ticking along , " walter told tagesspiegel am sonntag .
" for years we had double-digit growth rates in exports , now we are heading towards zero , " he added .
growth slower in euro zone than in the us analysts have already begun reversing downward their growth projections for europe 's largest economy .
the german finance ministry said last week that german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrank considerably in the second quarter after a strong start to the year , when europe 's largest economy expanded at its fastest rate since 1996 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retail sales in germany have fallen amid a downbeat mood among consumers german business daily handelsblatt said that based on a survey of 10 leading german and international banks and research institutes , big german companies will have to reckon with shrinking profits this year .
hopes that europe could isolate itself from the economic crisis in the us have evaporated , the paper said .
instead , current forecasts show that both economic growth and rise in profits in the euro zone in 2008 may be slower than in the us , the paper said .
the experts surveyed by the paper expect growth of just 0.9 percent in the euro zone for next year as against 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2.7 percent in 2007 .
in june , the european central bank had forecast a growth rate of 1.5 percent for the euro zone in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians are calling for a comprehensive , nationwide law against smoking on the heels of the recent ruling by the german constitutional court to partially overturn bans in several german states . after years of dragging its feet on implementing a smoking ban , germany went smoke-free in bars and restaurants this year in a move that has both raised hackles and won praise .
so last wednesday 's court ruling , which found that individual state laws allowing bars to set up separate smoking and non-smoking areas gave large multi-room pubs an advantage over smaller one-room pubs , was one that was met with fierce debate . renate kuenast , the parliamentary co-leader of the opposition green party , criticized the federal government in comments on the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel on sunday .
" it was an act of cowardice to leave protection of non-smokers up to the states , " kuenast said . germans in favor of federal rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rule reversal now allows smoking in one-room pubs that 's a sentiment that many germans are echoing .
in a survey by the emnid institute that was published in the bild am sonntag newspaper sunday , some 81 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of the federal government setting rules on smoking in bars and restaurants instead of ceding responsibility to the states . even so , the bild survey showed a lack of agreement as to what those rules should be .
some 20 percent of respondents opposed a ban while 56 percent supported a smoking ban with exceptions – such as for small corner pubs .
just 23 percent wanted all bars and restaurants to be smoke-free . still , kuenast said that the green party would seek a nationwide ban on the basis of worker safety , which is regulated by the federal government . as the laws stand now , each state has been able to devise its own regulations against smoking .
in bavaria , that means smokers get a reprieve during the state 's annual oktoberfest , when the beer tents synonymous with the festival become smoking zones . calls for consistency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer tents at oktoberfest : still a smoking zone .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , premier of the german state of hesse , said , however , that the states themselves could develop their own comprehensive smoking ban and he 's promised to put that issue on the agenda of the next meeting of state premiers in dresden in october .
" it is sensible for the states to reach as much of an amicable consensus on non-smoker protection as possible and to prevent a patchwork of regulations across the country , " koch said .
" we should also agree not to turn this into a political debate . " marlies volkmer , the social democratic spokeswoman for the german parliament 's committee for nutrition , agriculture and consumer protection , agreed . " the state parliaments are now called upon to use their discretion in order to impose a general smoking ban , " she said .
" only a consistent approach will truly serve health protection measures and would be completely clear for both pub owners and guests .

but can the military help cut crime ? the controversial deployment of nearly 3,000 troops throughout italy was introduced by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right government as a move that would help combat crime .
the government , which took office in april after berlusconi successfully campaigned on a law-and-order platform , has linked crime and illegal immigration and passed a series of measures aimed at cracking down on both .
to that end , the government began a six-month deployment of hundreds of troops who now join local police forces in urban centers like rome , naples , and milan , according to press reports from those cities .
another 1,000 of the troops went to embassies , railway stations , churches , and other sensitive places where tourists tend to congregate .
the soldiers there have been authorized to only make arrests when they catch people actually committing a crime .
the remaining third have been sent to guard holding centers for illegal immigrants .
on the island of lampedusa , where thousands of migrants have arrived from africa in recent months seeking to enter europe , 70 air force troops were supplementing police who patrol the perimeter of a reception center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops were likewise deployed to the immigrant holding center at lampedusa claims of increased security have opposition crying foul interior minister roberto maroni of the anti-immigrant northern league said he wants to " give the public a better perception of security . "
opposition leaders have criticized the move , however , labeling it as " propaganda " and questioning its effectiveness in combating crime .
they have argued instead that more funds and other resources should have been provided to the police .
a union representing the police , coisp , also slammed the decision , and in a statement welcomed the fact that no soldiers are to be deployed in venice .
" we 're off the hook -lrb- in venice -rrb- because for every three soldiers deployed , one police or carabinieri -lrb- paramilitary police -rrb- needs to be provided as backup , " coisp said in a statement .
" where are we going to find extra police ? "
coisp asked , lamenting what it said was a scarcity of fuel for police squad cars and a lack of overtime pay for police officers .
rome rejects " militarization " of its city center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's mayor wo n't allow troops in the city 's historic district rome 's mayor , gianni alemanno likewise hit back , refusing to allow the troops to patrol the historic city center , where the majority of tourists spend their time .
he said he feared that the " militarization " of the capital would scare away visitors .
officials , however , downplayed the decision to draft in troops .
" in 1992 , 20,000 men were sent to sicily alone " to aid police in fighting the mafia after the murder of two judges , deputy chief of the general staff general mario buscemi was quoted by daily la repubblica as saying .

verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .

even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .

if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .

again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .

on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .

verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .

while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .
on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .
they say that it is up to the ioc as the dosb does not have any leverage - since the dosb president thomas bach is also the vice-president of the ioc , we should see very soon whether they are really serious about this . nick amies interviewed verena harpe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to the german olympic sports federation amid a growing debate on human rights as the beijing olympics loom . this weekend , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering called on athletes traveling to the beijing olympics to protest against human rights violations in tibet .
" each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .

last week , under the slogan " we are all chinese , " nine german olympians posed in their sports kit for a munich magazine while holding pictures of chinese dissidents in front of their faces .
many of the national olympic committees -lrb- nocs -rrb- have been criticized by human rights groups for their stances on the situation in china and the regulations that some of them have applied to their athletes traveling to beijing as the debate over press freedom and human rights abuses intensifies in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing , dw-world.de spoke to michael schirp , head of the media department at the german olympic s ports federation ’ s -lrb- dosb -rrb- about what 's acceptable and what 's not .
dw-world.de : amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has called for the dosb to clarify its rules on political protests by athletes .
has the dosb taken any action on this or does it believe the rules are clear ?
michael schirp : dosb states that rules have been made clear by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- .
in germany , the dosb has explained the rules both in public and on the german team 's internal olympic web site . generally , athletes are free to say what they think , be it inside or outside of the olympic venues .
they may express their opinions in press conferences or even in the mixed zones , in our “ deutsches haus ” or anywhere else .
there is only one issue that is prohibited according to the ioc charter : the showing of signs , flags , bracelets , pins , banners with political , racial , ethnic , religious content or propaganda if shown inside of areas where an accreditation is needed such as the olympic venues .
apart from that , amnesty international and the dosb have worked together on the subject of human rights since may 2007 .
amnesty international has criticized the dosb for saying that the wearing of wristbands -lrb- ai 's “ gold for human rights ” or the german athletes ' “ sports for human rights ” bands -rrb- are forbidden as they are political statements .
does this ruling still stand ?
what is the dosb 's definition of a political statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german olympic team with president horst koehler i would point you to my first answer .
this is not limited to olympic games .
you 'll find this in any major sport event .
if every political , religious or ethnic conflict in the world would be carried into sporting events , the weight of such statements would be marginalized anyway .
but the most important thing is to keep these conflicts out of the event itself .
sport is intended to build bridges , not to further build walls .
it is only at the olympic games that 205 nocs and the countries they represent come together in a peaceful competition .
what are the dosb guidelines in terms of punishments for athletes who make political statements or protests in beijing ?
we do n't have any of those .
we are sure athletes are aware of their responsibility and have made up their minds regarding human rights in china .
they will find ways to express their opinion or , if they choose , not to , which also has to be respected as their free will .
before the chinese crackdown in tibet , neither the ioc nor dosb mentioned anything about china 's human rights record .
did the tibet situation force the olympic committees to accept that china had a human rights problem ?
to be perfectly blunt , this is just wrong .

it was in may 2007 , almost a year before the incidents in tibet , that the dosb published a declaration on human rights in china .

dw-world.de spoke to the german olympic sports federation amid a growing debate on human rights as the beijing olympics loom . this weekend , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering called on athletes traveling to the beijing olympics to protest against human rights violations in tibet .
" each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
last week , under the slogan " we are all chinese , " nine german olympians posed in their sports kit for a munich magazine while holding pictures of chinese dissidents in front of their faces .
many of the national olympic committees -lrb- nocs -rrb- have been criticized by human rights groups for their stances on the situation in china and the regulations that some of them have applied to their athletes traveling to beijing as the debate over press freedom and human rights abuses intensifies in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing , dw-world.de spoke to michael schirp , head of the media department at the german olympic s ports federation ’ s -lrb- dosb -rrb- about what 's acceptable and what 's not .
dw-world.de : amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has called for the dosb to clarify its rules on political protests by athletes .
has the dosb taken any action on this or does it believe the rules are clear ?
michael schirp : dosb states that rules have been made clear by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- .
in germany , the dosb has explained the rules both in public and on the german team 's internal olympic web site . generally , athletes are free to say what they think , be it inside or outside of the olympic venues .
they may express their opinions in press conferences or even in the mixed zones , in our “ deutsches haus ” or anywhere else .
there is only one issue that is prohibited according to the ioc charter : the showing of signs , flags , bracelets , pins , banners with political , racial , ethnic , religious content or propaganda if shown inside of areas where an accreditation is needed such as the olympic venues .
apart from that , amnesty international and the dosb have worked together on the subject of human rights since may 2007 .
amnesty international has criticized the dosb for saying that the wearing of wristbands -lrb- ai 's “ gold for human rights ” or the german athletes ' “ sports for human rights ” bands -rrb- are forbidden as they are political statements .
does this ruling still stand ?
what is the dosb 's definition of a political statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german olympic team with president horst koehler i would point you to my first answer .
this is not limited to olympic games .
you 'll find this in any major sport event .
if every political , religious or ethnic conflict in the world would be carried into sporting events , the weight of such statements would be marginalized anyway .
but the most important thing is to keep these conflicts out of the event itself .
sport is intended to build bridges , not to further build walls .
it is only at the olympic games that 205 nocs and the countries they represent come together in a peaceful competition .
what are the dosb guidelines in terms of punishments for athletes who make political statements or protests in beijing ?
we do n't have any of those .
we are sure athletes are aware of their responsibility and have made up their minds regarding human rights in china .
they will find ways to express their opinion or , if they choose , not to , which also has to be respected as their free will .
before the chinese crackdown in tibet , neither the ioc nor dosb mentioned anything about china 's human rights record .
did the tibet situation force the olympic committees to accept that china had a human rights problem ?
to be perfectly blunt , this is just wrong .
before tibet , the media were not interested in sporting organizations which dealt with the issue .
it was in may 2007 , almost a year before the incidents in tibet , that the dosb published a declaration on human rights in china .
this was unique at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against china 's tibet policy marred the olympic torch relay in europe we clearly stated that we consider the situation to be unsatisfactory .
but we are a sport organization and can not solve the problems that the un and others could n't solve for 50 years .

but can the military help cut crime ? the controversial deployment of nearly 3,000 troops throughout italy was introduced by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right government as a move that would help combat crime .
the government , which took office in april after berlusconi successfully campaigned on a law-and-order platform , has linked crime and illegal immigration and passed a series of measures aimed at cracking down on both .
to that end , the government began a six-month deployment of hundreds of troops who now join local police forces in urban centers like rome , naples , and milan , according to press reports from those cities .
another 1,000 of the troops went to embassies , railway stations , churches , and other sensitive places where tourists tend to congregate .
the soldiers there have been authorized to only make arrests when they catch people actually committing a crime .
the remaining third have been sent to guard holding centers for illegal immigrants .
on the island of lampedusa , where thousands of migrants have arrived from africa in recent months seeking to enter europe , 70 air force troops were supplementing police who patrol the perimeter of a reception center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops were likewise deployed to the immigrant holding center at lampedusa claims of increased security have opposition crying foul interior minister roberto maroni of the anti-immigrant northern league said he wants to " give the public a better perception of security . "
opposition leaders have criticized the move , however , labeling it as " propaganda " and questioning its effectiveness in combating crime .
they have argued instead that more funds and other resources should have been provided to the police .
a union representing the police , coisp , also slammed the decision , and in a statement welcomed the fact that no soldiers are to be deployed in venice .
" we 're off the hook -lrb- in venice -rrb- because for every three soldiers deployed , one police or carabinieri -lrb- paramilitary police -rrb- needs to be provided as backup , " coisp said in a statement .

in the interview , which includes a brief discussion on the recent bombing in istanbul , uhrlau was quoted as saying that he knew that " islamist terrorist " forces were at work in turkey as part of a global jihad movement . those forces , he claimed , were just a part of the al qaeda terrorist network .
al qaeda , he said , is still being run by osama bin laden , who " as far as we know " still resides in the afghan-pakistani border region .
uhrlau , however , no longer sees bin laden as personally planning attacks . instead , uhrlau said , he is " a creative director and icon , something like the che guevara of al qaeda " who helps hold the terror network together . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians are calling for a comprehensive , nationwide law against smoking on the heels of the recent ruling by the german constitutional court to partially overturn bans in several german states . after years of dragging its feet on implementing a smoking ban , germany went smoke-free in bars and restaurants this year in a move that has both raised hackles and won praise .
so last wednesday 's court ruling , which found that individual state laws allowing bars to set up separate smoking and non-smoking areas gave large multi-room pubs an advantage over smaller one-room pubs , was one that was met with fierce debate . renate kuenast , the parliamentary co-leader of the opposition green party , criticized the federal government in comments on the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel on sunday .
" it was an act of cowardice to leave protection of non-smokers up to the states , " kuenast said . germans in favor of federal rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rule reversal now allows smoking in one-room pubs that 's a sentiment that many germans are echoing .
in a survey by the emnid institute that was published in the bild am sonntag newspaper sunday , some 81 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of the federal government setting rules on smoking in bars and restaurants instead of ceding responsibility to the states . even so , the bild survey showed a lack of agreement as to what those rules should be .
some 20 percent of respondents opposed a ban while 56 percent supported a smoking ban with exceptions – such as for small corner pubs .
just 23 percent wanted all bars and restaurants to be smoke-free . still , kuenast said that the green party would seek a nationwide ban on the basis of worker safety , which is regulated by the federal government . as the laws stand now , each state has been able to devise its own regulations against smoking .
in bavaria , that means smokers get a reprieve during the state 's annual oktoberfest , when the beer tents synonymous with the festival become smoking zones . calls for consistency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer tents at oktoberfest : still a smoking zone .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , premier of the german state of hesse , said , however , that the states themselves could develop their own comprehensive smoking ban and he 's promised to put that issue on the agenda of the next meeting of state premiers in dresden in october .
" it is sensible for the states to reach as much of an amicable consensus on non-smoker protection as possible and to prevent a patchwork of regulations across the country , " koch said .
" we should also agree not to turn this into a political debate . " marlies volkmer , the social democratic spokeswoman for the german parliament 's committee for nutrition , agriculture and consumer protection , agreed . " the state parliaments are now called upon to use their discretion in order to impose a general smoking ban , " she said .
" only a consistent approach will truly serve health protection measures and would be completely clear for both pub owners and guests .

4 , to allow all under-23 players to participate at the olympics . the plea comes ahead of the men 's olympic football tournament , which starts aug .
7 , a day ahead of the official opening of the beijing olympics .
the tournament is open to players under the age of 23 , but three clubs have appealed to the court of arbitration for sport -lrb- cas -rrb- for the return of their players who are already in china . german clubs werder bremen and schalke 04 , as well as barcelona , have approached cas about their players diego , rafinha and lionel messi , respectively . blatter told a news conference at the beijing main press center that whatever the outcome before the world 's highest sports arbitration body , due in the next two days , fifa would tell the players to stay and play . " we are bound by the decisions of cas , but even if it is a decision that is negative for the players , i would say : let them play . " he also said that even with a cas rule in favor of the three clubs , the clubs should allow the players to stay . " the clubs should then say : we were right to appeal to cas , but in the spirit of the olympic games we will let them stay and play , " blatter said . finding a balance between clubs and national teams the soccer head said that he was surprised that these problems had arisen ahead of these games . " in 1988 the fifa congress made the decision that the olympic tournament should be open to players under 23 , " he said .
" since then , we have not had a single complaint or problem with the release of players . " also when the tournament was opened to include three over-aged players , it remained without problems , " blatter added . he said he thought this issue was part of the ongoing problem of trying to combine the interest of clubs with that of the national teams . " we have to find a balance , " he said . at the same time , blatter complimented the english premier league and the italian serie a for releasing all their players , irrespective of whether they were under-23 or not . " we need solidarity in soccer " he said .
" we need everybody to work together .
players should be given the opportunity of playing at the olympics . " he dismissed the argument put forward by some clubs saying that as the olympic tournament was not on the international match calendar , players need not be released for it . " the match calendar deals only with the senior national teams ; it does not mention youth tournament , " he said . revised rules for london ? he also said that the fifa congress in 2006 had decided that the format of the olympic tournament will stay the same for 2008 , but that the issue would be revisited after the beijing games for the 2012 olympics in london . " in england there will also be the issue of one british team instead of four associations which fifa recognizes , " said blatter , referring to fifa 's special dispensation which allows scotland , england , wales and northern ireland to field their own teams in other fifa competitions . " the olympic body will allow just one team , britain , " blatter said . the 72-year-old , who said that this tournament was a special one because it marked 100 years of olympic soccer , thanked the ioc for allowing 12 women teams and 16 men teams to participate . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ many companies still see job training as a cost factor and not as an investment , ” dgb vice president ingrid sehrbrock told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" unacceptable " situation germany trails the field in international comparisons of job training , sehrbrock said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions advocate trading overtime for training " it is still the case that those who are already well qualified are the ones who get offered the training opportunities first , ” sehrbrock said .
and people over age 45 are encouraged less than the younger workers are , she added .
giving the country 's aging demographics , this situation is “ unacceptable , ” sehrbrock said .
meanwhile a dgb poll showed that job training is an important topic , with 70 percent of respondents saying that lifelong learning is important to them .
some 68 percent of workers complained their companies offered them few , if any , training opportunities .
and 55 percent said further education does not play an important role for their superiors .
plan promotes " learning accounts " in response , the dgb is calling for a “ second chance for adults ” program that would include increased federal loans for workers interested in further job training .
specifically , the dgb is promoting the idea of “ learning accounts , ” where workers can bank vacation days or overtime toward paying for further qualifications .
sehrbrock hopes the government would grant small and mid-size companies financial aid and advice in support of the measures . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 , to allow all under-23 players to participate at the olympics . the plea comes ahead of the men 's olympic football tournament , which starts aug .
7 , a day ahead of the official opening of the beijing olympics .
the tournament is open to players under the age of 23 , but three clubs have appealed to the court of arbitration for sport -lrb- cas -rrb- for the return of their players who are already in china . german clubs werder bremen and schalke 04 , as well as barcelona , have approached cas about their players diego , rafinha and lionel messi , respectively . blatter told a news conference at the beijing main press center that whatever the outcome before the world 's highest sports arbitration body , due in the next two days , fifa would tell the players to stay and play . " we are bound by the decisions of cas , but even if it is a decision that is negative for the players , i would say : let them play . " he also said that even with a cas rule in favor of the three clubs , the clubs should allow the players to stay . " the clubs should then say : we were right to appeal to cas , but in the spirit of the olympic games we will let them stay and play , " blatter said . finding a balance between clubs and national teams the soccer head said that he was surprised that these problems had arisen ahead of these games . " in 1988 the fifa congress made the decision that the olympic tournament should be open to players under 23 , " he said .
" since then , we have not had a single complaint or problem with the release of players . " also when the tournament was opened to include three over-aged players , it remained without problems , " blatter added . he said he thought this issue was part of the ongoing problem of trying to combine the interest of clubs with that of the national teams . " we have to find a balance , " he said . at the same time , blatter complimented the english premier league and the italian serie a for releasing all their players , irrespective of whether they were under-23 or not . " we need solidarity in soccer " he said .
" we need everybody to work together .
players should be given the opportunity of playing at the olympics . " he dismissed the argument put forward by some clubs saying that as the olympic tournament was not on the international match calendar , players need not be released for it . " the match calendar deals only with the senior national teams ; it does not mention youth tournament , " he said . revised rules for london ? he also said that the fifa congress in 2006 had decided that the format of the olympic tournament will stay the same for 2008 , but that the issue would be revisited after the beijing games for the 2012 olympics in london . " in england there will also be the issue of one british team instead of four associations which fifa recognizes , " said blatter , referring to fifa 's special dispensation which allows scotland , england , wales and northern ireland to field their own teams in other fifa competitions . " the olympic body will allow just one team , britain , " blatter said . the 72-year-old , who said that this tournament was a special one because it marked 100 years of olympic soccer , thanked the ioc for allowing 12 women teams and 16 men teams to participate . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview published monday , germany 's intelligence chief said that osama bin laden , the " che guevara of al qaeda , " no longer personally plans attacks . ernst uhrlau , the head of germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , spoke with bild newspaper reporter monday about terrorism and the bnd 's efforts to combat it .

4 , to allow all under-23 players to participate at the olympics . the plea comes ahead of the men 's olympic football tournament , which starts aug .
7 , a day ahead of the official opening of the beijing olympics .
the tournament is open to players under the age of 23 , but three clubs have appealed to the court of arbitration for sport -lrb- cas -rrb- for the return of their players who are already in china . german clubs werder bremen and schalke 04 , as well as barcelona , have approached cas about their players diego , rafinha and lionel messi , respectively . blatter told a news conference at the beijing main press center that whatever the outcome before the world 's highest sports arbitration body , due in the next two days , fifa would tell the players to stay and play . " we are bound by the decisions of cas , but even if it is a decision that is negative for the players , i would say : let them play . " he also said that even with a cas rule in favor of the three clubs , the clubs should allow the players to stay . " the clubs should then say : we were right to appeal to cas , but in the spirit of the olympic games we will let them stay and play , " blatter said . finding a balance between clubs and national teams the soccer head said that he was surprised that these problems had arisen ahead of these games . " in 1988 the fifa congress made the decision that the olympic tournament should be open to players under 23 , " he said .
" since then , we have not had a single complaint or problem with the release of players . " also when the tournament was opened to include three over-aged players , it remained without problems , " blatter added . he said he thought this issue was part of the ongoing problem of trying to combine the interest of clubs with that of the national teams . " we have to find a balance , " he said . at the same time , blatter complimented the english premier league and the italian serie a for releasing all their players , irrespective of whether they were under-23 or not . " we need solidarity in soccer " he said .
" we need everybody to work together .
players should be given the opportunity of playing at the olympics . " he dismissed the argument put forward by some clubs saying that as the olympic tournament was not on the international match calendar , players need not be released for it . " the match calendar deals only with the senior national teams ; it does not mention youth tournament , " he said . revised rules for london ? he also said that the fifa congress in 2006 had decided that the format of the olympic tournament will stay the same for 2008 , but that the issue would be revisited after the beijing games for the 2012 olympics in london . " in england there will also be the issue of one british team instead of four associations which fifa recognizes , " said blatter , referring to fifa 's special dispensation which allows scotland , england , wales and northern ireland to field their own teams in other fifa competitions . " the olympic body will allow just one team , britain , " blatter said . the 72-year-old , who said that this tournament was a special one because it marked 100 years of olympic soccer , thanked the ioc for allowing 12 women teams and 16 men teams to participate . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians are calling for a comprehensive , nationwide law against smoking on the heels of the recent ruling by the german constitutional court to partially overturn bans in several german states . after years of dragging its feet on implementing a smoking ban , germany went smoke-free in bars and restaurants this year in a move that has both raised hackles and won praise .
so last wednesday 's court ruling , which found that individual state laws allowing bars to set up separate smoking and non-smoking areas gave large multi-room pubs an advantage over smaller one-room pubs , was one that was met with fierce debate . renate kuenast , the parliamentary co-leader of the opposition green party , criticized the federal government in comments on the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel on sunday .

some 20 percent of respondents opposed a ban while 56 percent supported a smoking ban with exceptions – such as for small corner pubs .
just 23 percent wanted all bars and restaurants to be smoke-free . still , kuenast said that the green party would seek a nationwide ban on the basis of worker safety , which is regulated by the federal government . as the laws stand now , each state has been able to devise its own regulations against smoking .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 04.08.2008 italy deploys troops in cities to tackle crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian soldiers now patrol parts of rome , naples , and milan an anti-crime measure in italy has some 3,000 troops taking up positions and patrolling streets in cities across the country monday .
but can the military help cut crime ? the controversial deployment of nearly 3,000 troops throughout italy was introduced by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right government as a move that would help combat crime .
the government , which took office in april after berlusconi successfully campaigned on a law-and-order platform , has linked crime and illegal immigration and passed a series of measures aimed at cracking down on both .
to that end , the government began a six-month deployment of hundreds of troops who now join local police forces in urban centers like rome , naples , and milan , according to press reports from those cities .
another 1,000 of the troops went to embassies , railway stations , churches , and other sensitive places where tourists tend to congregate .
the soldiers there have been authorized to only make arrests when they catch people actually committing a crime .
the remaining third have been sent to guard holding centers for illegal immigrants .
on the island of lampedusa , where thousands of migrants have arrived from africa in recent months seeking to enter europe , 70 air force troops were supplementing police who patrol the perimeter of a reception center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops were likewise deployed to the immigrant holding center at lampedusa claims of increased security have opposition crying foul interior minister roberto maroni of the anti-immigrant northern league said he wants to " give the public a better perception of security . "
opposition leaders have criticized the move , however , labeling it as " propaganda " and questioning its effectiveness in combating crime .
they have argued instead that more funds and other resources should have been provided to the police .
a union representing the police , coisp , also slammed the decision , and in a statement welcomed the fact that no soldiers are to be deployed in venice .
" we 're off the hook -lrb- in venice -rrb- because for every three soldiers deployed , one police or carabinieri -lrb- paramilitary police -rrb- needs to be provided as backup , " coisp said in a statement .
" where are we going to find extra police ? "
coisp asked , lamenting what it said was a scarcity of fuel for police squad cars and a lack of overtime pay for police officers .
rome rejects " militarization " of its city center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's mayor wo n't allow troops in the city 's historic district rome 's mayor , gianni alemanno likewise hit back , refusing to allow the troops to patrol the historic city center , where the majority of tourists spend their time .
he said he feared that the " militarization " of the capital would scare away visitors .
officials , however , downplayed the decision to draft in troops .
" in 1992 , 20,000 men were sent to sicily alone " to aid police in fighting the mafia after the murder of two judges , deputy chief of the general staff general mario buscemi was quoted by daily la repubblica as saying .
in comparision , this smaller deployment would be minor and essentially symbolic , he said . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

conflicting voices only add to the confusion and contradiction . the beijing summer olympics begin on aug 8 and while the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- hopes that most eyes will be on the sporting prowess on the track and field , no-one is under any illusion that the focus will also be on events outside the glittering arenas .
the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .
but attempting to get a clear view of the current state-of-play is as difficult as peering through the beijing smog on a hazy summer morning .
those looking for evidence of change , whether positive or negative , must rely on the statements of the various parties involved in the human rights debate .
do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up to the beijing olympics has been marked by protests around the world there are tangible examples of minor improvements , however .
after increasing pressure from world leaders and the united nations , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review in 2007 which means that every death sentence must now be heard by the top court .
before that , it was left to the local courts to decide and without strict judicial review there were many miscarriages of justice .
china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .
there will be no censorship on the internet . "
rogge explained that foreign journalists can now travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
" we also realised that there were abuses in the factories making mascots and material for bocog -lrb- the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad -rrb- , " he added .
" the chinese reacted very well .
they arrested those responsible and had a new law passed .
" the third thing was to obtain proper compensation for people dispossessed by the olympic building projects .
the fourth was new legislation for protecting the environment .
on these four points we achieved satisfaction . "
journalists being stymied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups have stepped up criticism of the chinese regime all of these measures sound like definite progress has been made , until one hears from the other side of the argument .
“ this increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story , ” verena harpe , the china expert at amnesty international germany 's asia desk told dw-world.de. harpe said increased mobility for foreign journalists was likely to last only last until after the paralympics in october . she pointed out that correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
" while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented , " she said .
harpe also explained that the people that journalists most want to talk to , usually those most interesting in terms of the situation in china , are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
reports of harassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch relay met with protests amnesty also challenges rogge 's claim that the ioc had helped bring in a law for compensation payments for persons displaced due to olympic construction .
harpe gave the example of a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction .
" he was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions , ” she said .
“ he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october - after the games . "
the reason is that foreign journalists would want to talk to him , harpe said , adding that intimidation and harassment as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
internet censorship continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some internet sites in the press center are blocked rogge 's claim that there would be no censorship of the internet in china also does n't hold water . “ the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was , ” harpe said .
“ even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to ‘ sensitive ' websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them . "
these so-called “ sensitive ” sites which have been shut down include independent new services , blogs attempting to get uncensored news out of china , and international broadcasters which have been deemed dangerous by the chinese government , dw-world.de 's chinese page included .
situation not getting any better amnesty 's harpe believes that behind these claims of progress , the human rights situation has actually worsened , not in spite of the olympics but because of them .
“ in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues , ” she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese police lay low during the olympics ?
to obtain lasting human rights reforms , amnesty international says that governments and olympic committees should move away from the “ quiet diplomacy ” promoted by the ioc and publicly criticize china ; despite claims that to do business with china it has to happen behind closed doors .
“ it is unlikely that the change in the death sentence review would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though public pressure has worked , ” harpe said .
but with the ioc and world leaders like french president nicolas sarkozy unwilling , or unable , to confront china publicly , further improvements - however minor - seem unlikely as the games approach . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .
there will be no censorship on the internet . "
rogge explained that foreign journalists can now travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
" we also realised that there were abuses in the factories making mascots and material for bocog -lrb- the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad -rrb- , " he added .
" the chinese reacted very well .
they arrested those responsible and had a new law passed .
" the third thing was to obtain proper compensation for people dispossessed by the olympic building projects .
the fourth was new legislation for protecting the environment .
on these four points we achieved satisfaction . "
journalists being stymied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups have stepped up criticism of the chinese regime all of these measures sound like definite progress has been made , until one hears from the other side of the argument .
“ this increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story , ” verena harpe , the china expert at amnesty international germany 's asia desk told dw-world.de. harpe said increased mobility for foreign journalists was likely to last only last until after the paralympics in october . she pointed out that correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
" while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented , " she said .
harpe also explained that the people that journalists most want to talk to , usually those most interesting in terms of the situation in china , are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
reports of harassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch relay met with protests amnesty also challenges rogge 's claim that the ioc had helped bring in a law for compensation payments for persons displaced due to olympic construction .
harpe gave the example of a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction .
" he was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions , ” she said .
“ he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october - after the games . "
the reason is that foreign journalists would want to talk to him , harpe said , adding that intimidation and harassment as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
internet censorship continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some internet sites in the press center are blocked rogge 's claim that there would be no censorship of the internet in china also does n't hold water . “ the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was , ” harpe said .
“ even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to ‘ sensitive ' websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them . "
these so-called “ sensitive ” sites which have been shut down include independent new services , blogs attempting to get uncensored news out of china , and international broadcasters which have been deemed dangerous by the chinese government , dw-world.de 's chinese page included .
situation not getting any better amnesty 's harpe believes that behind these claims of progress , the human rights situation has actually worsened , not in spite of the olympics but because of them .
“ in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues , ” she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese police lay low during the olympics ?
to obtain lasting human rights reforms , amnesty international says that governments and olympic committees should move away from the “ quiet diplomacy ” promoted by the ioc and publicly criticize china ; despite claims that to do business with china it has to happen behind closed doors .
“ it is unlikely that the change in the death sentence review would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though public pressure has worked , ” harpe said .

conflicting voices only add to the confusion and contradiction . the beijing summer olympics begin on aug 8 and while the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- hopes that most eyes will be on the sporting prowess on the track and field , no-one is under any illusion that the focus will also be on events outside the glittering arenas .
the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .
but attempting to get a clear view of the current state-of-play is as difficult as peering through the beijing smog on a hazy summer morning .
those looking for evidence of change , whether positive or negative , must rely on the statements of the various parties involved in the human rights debate .
do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .

the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .
but attempting to get a clear view of the current state-of-play is as difficult as peering through the beijing smog on a hazy summer morning .
those looking for evidence of change , whether positive or negative , must rely on the statements of the various parties involved in the human rights debate .
do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up to the beijing olympics has been marked by protests around the world there are tangible examples of minor improvements , however .
after increasing pressure from world leaders and the united nations , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review in 2007 which means that every death sentence must now be heard by the top court .
before that , it was left to the local courts to decide and without strict judicial review there were many miscarriages of justice .
china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .
there will be no censorship on the internet . "
rogge explained that foreign journalists can now travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
" we also realised that there were abuses in the factories making mascots and material for bocog -lrb- the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad -rrb- , " he added .
" the chinese reacted very well .
they arrested those responsible and had a new law passed .
" the third thing was to obtain proper compensation for people dispossessed by the olympic building projects .
the fourth was new legislation for protecting the environment .
on these four points we achieved satisfaction . "
journalists being stymied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups have stepped up criticism of the chinese regime all of these measures sound like definite progress has been made , until one hears from the other side of the argument .
“ this increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story , ” verena harpe , the china expert at amnesty international germany 's asia desk told dw-world.de. harpe said increased mobility for foreign journalists was likely to last only last until after the paralympics in october . she pointed out that correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
" while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented , " she said .
harpe also explained that the people that journalists most want to talk to , usually those most interesting in terms of the situation in china , are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
reports of harassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch relay met with protests amnesty also challenges rogge 's claim that the ioc had helped bring in a law for compensation payments for persons displaced due to olympic construction .
harpe gave the example of a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction .
" he was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions , ” she said .
“ he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october - after the games . "
the reason is that foreign journalists would want to talk to him , harpe said , adding that intimidation and harassment as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
internet censorship continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some internet sites in the press center are blocked rogge 's claim that there would be no censorship of the internet in china also does n't hold water . “ the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was , ” harpe said .
“ even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to ‘ sensitive ' websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them . "
these so-called “ sensitive ” sites which have been shut down include independent new services , blogs attempting to get uncensored news out of china , and international broadcasters which have been deemed dangerous by the chinese government , dw-world.de 's chinese page included .
situation not getting any better amnesty 's harpe believes that behind these claims of progress , the human rights situation has actually worsened , not in spite of the olympics but because of them .
“ in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues , ” she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese police lay low during the olympics ?
to obtain lasting human rights reforms , amnesty international says that governments and olympic committees should move away from the “ quiet diplomacy ” promoted by the ioc and publicly criticize china ; despite claims that to do business with china it has to happen behind closed doors .
“ it is unlikely that the change in the death sentence review would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though public pressure has worked , ” harpe said .
but with the ioc and world leaders like french president nicolas sarkozy unwilling , or unable , to confront china publicly , further improvements - however minor - seem unlikely as the games approach . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to the german olympic sports federation amid a growing debate on human rights as the beijing olympics loom . this weekend , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering called on athletes traveling to the beijing olympics to protest against human rights violations in tibet .
" each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .

last week , under the slogan " we are all chinese , " nine german olympians posed in their sports kit for a munich magazine while holding pictures of chinese dissidents in front of their faces .
many of the national olympic committees -lrb- nocs -rrb- have been criticized by human rights groups for their stances on the situation in china and the regulations that some of them have applied to their athletes traveling to beijing as the debate over press freedom and human rights abuses intensifies in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing , dw-world.de spoke to michael schirp , head of the media department at the german olympic s ports federation ’ s -lrb- dosb -rrb- about what 's acceptable and what 's not .
dw-world.de : amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has called for the dosb to clarify its rules on political protests by athletes .
has the dosb taken any action on this or does it believe the rules are clear ?
michael schirp : dosb states that rules have been made clear by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- .
in germany , the dosb has explained the rules both in public and on the german team 's internal olympic web site . generally , athletes are free to say what they think , be it inside or outside of the olympic venues .
they may express their opinions in press conferences or even in the mixed zones , in our “ deutsches haus ” or anywhere else .
there is only one issue that is prohibited according to the ioc charter : the showing of signs , flags , bracelets , pins , banners with political , racial , ethnic , religious content or propaganda if shown inside of areas where an accreditation is needed such as the olympic venues .
apart from that , amnesty international and the dosb have worked together on the subject of human rights since may 2007 .
amnesty international has criticized the dosb for saying that the wearing of wristbands -lrb- ai 's “ gold for human rights ” or the german athletes ' “ sports for human rights ” bands -rrb- are forbidden as they are political statements .
does this ruling still stand ?
what is the dosb 's definition of a political statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german olympic team with president horst koehler i would point you to my first answer .
this is not limited to olympic games .
you 'll find this in any major sport event .
if every political , religious or ethnic conflict in the world would be carried into sporting events , the weight of such statements would be marginalized anyway .
but the most important thing is to keep these conflicts out of the event itself .
sport is intended to build bridges , not to further build walls .
it is only at the olympic games that 205 nocs and the countries they represent come together in a peaceful competition .
what are the dosb guidelines in terms of punishments for athletes who make political statements or protests in beijing ?
we do n't have any of those .
we are sure athletes are aware of their responsibility and have made up their minds regarding human rights in china .
they will find ways to express their opinion or , if they choose , not to , which also has to be respected as their free will .
before the chinese crackdown in tibet , neither the ioc nor dosb mentioned anything about china 's human rights record .
did the tibet situation force the olympic committees to accept that china had a human rights problem ?
to be perfectly blunt , this is just wrong .
before tibet , the media were not interested in sporting organizations which dealt with the issue .
it was in may 2007 , almost a year before the incidents in tibet , that the dosb published a declaration on human rights in china .
this was unique at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against china 's tibet policy marred the olympic torch relay in europe we clearly stated that we consider the situation to be unsatisfactory .
but we are a sport organization and can not solve the problems that the un and others could n't solve for 50 years .
sport is communication , not isolation .
we repeated this during easter 2008 and urged the parties in tibet to stop violence and bloodshed .

amnesty international has said that it has held meetings with the dosb to discuss human right .
what has been the outcome of the meetings with ai ?
this was just the start .

dw-world.de spoke to the german olympic sports federation amid a growing debate on human rights as the beijing olympics loom . this weekend , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering called on athletes traveling to the beijing olympics to protest against human rights violations in tibet .

last week , under the slogan " we are all chinese , " nine german olympians posed in their sports kit for a munich magazine while holding pictures of chinese dissidents in front of their faces .
many of the national olympic committees -lrb- nocs -rrb- have been criticized by human rights groups for their stances on the situation in china and the regulations that some of them have applied to their athletes traveling to beijing as the debate over press freedom and human rights abuses intensifies in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing , dw-world.de spoke to michael schirp , head of the media department at the german olympic s ports federation ’ s -lrb- dosb -rrb- about what 's acceptable and what 's not .
dw-world.de : amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has called for the dosb to clarify its rules on political protests by athletes .
has the dosb taken any action on this or does it believe the rules are clear ?
michael schirp : dosb states that rules have been made clear by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- .
in germany , the dosb has explained the rules both in public and on the german team 's internal olympic web site . generally , athletes are free to say what they think , be it inside or outside of the olympic venues .
they may express their opinions in press conferences or even in the mixed zones , in our “ deutsches haus ” or anywhere else .
there is only one issue that is prohibited according to the ioc charter : the showing of signs , flags , bracelets , pins , banners with political , racial , ethnic , religious content or propaganda if shown inside of areas where an accreditation is needed such as the olympic venues .
apart from that , amnesty international and the dosb have worked together on the subject of human rights since may 2007 .
amnesty international has criticized the dosb for saying that the wearing of wristbands -lrb- ai 's “ gold for human rights ” or the german athletes ' “ sports for human rights ” bands -rrb- are forbidden as they are political statements .
does this ruling still stand ?
what is the dosb 's definition of a political statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german olympic team with president horst koehler i would point you to my first answer .
this is not limited to olympic games .
you 'll find this in any major sport event .
if every political , religious or ethnic conflict in the world would be carried into sporting events , the weight of such statements would be marginalized anyway .
but the most important thing is to keep these conflicts out of the event itself .
sport is intended to build bridges , not to further build walls .
it is only at the olympic games that 205 nocs and the countries they represent come together in a peaceful competition .
what are the dosb guidelines in terms of punishments for athletes who make political statements or protests in beijing ?
we do n't have any of those .
we are sure athletes are aware of their responsibility and have made up their minds regarding human rights in china .
they will find ways to express their opinion or , if they choose , not to , which also has to be respected as their free will .
before the chinese crackdown in tibet , neither the ioc nor dosb mentioned anything about china 's human rights record .
did the tibet situation force the olympic committees to accept that china had a human rights problem ?
to be perfectly blunt , this is just wrong .
before tibet , the media were not interested in sporting organizations which dealt with the issue .
it was in may 2007 , almost a year before the incidents in tibet , that the dosb published a declaration on human rights in china .

verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .
on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .
they say that it is up to the ioc as the dosb does not have any leverage - since the dosb president thomas bach is also the vice-president of the ioc , we should see very soon whether they are really serious about this . nick amies interviewed verena harpe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views german foreign minister says olympics will " open up " china human rights -pipe- 04.08.2008 amnesty international : china has made only minor progress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international organized a large protest in berlin in december verena harpe , a china expert from amnesty international deutschland 's asia desk , spoke with dw-world.de about the current state of human rights in china and the efforts of the international community . dw-world.de : ever since the international pressure over human rights started to build , what efforts has china made to improve conditions ?
verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .
on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .
they say that it is up to the ioc as the dosb does not have any leverage - since the dosb president thomas bach is also the vice-president of the ioc , we should see very soon whether they are really serious about this . nick amies interviewed verena harpe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .

these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .
on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .
they say that it is up to the ioc as the dosb does not have any leverage - since the dosb president thomas bach is also the vice-president of the ioc , we should see very soon whether they are really serious about this . nick amies interviewed verena harpe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians are calling for a comprehensive , nationwide law against smoking on the heels of the recent ruling by the german constitutional court to partially overturn bans in several german states . after years of dragging its feet on implementing a smoking ban , germany went smoke-free in bars and restaurants this year in a move that has both raised hackles and won praise .
so last wednesday 's court ruling , which found that individual state laws allowing bars to set up separate smoking and non-smoking areas gave large multi-room pubs an advantage over smaller one-room pubs , was one that was met with fierce debate . renate kuenast , the parliamentary co-leader of the opposition green party , criticized the federal government in comments on the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel on sunday .
" it was an act of cowardice to leave protection of non-smokers up to the states , " kuenast said . germans in favor of federal rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rule reversal now allows smoking in one-room pubs that 's a sentiment that many germans are echoing .
in a survey by the emnid institute that was published in the bild am sonntag newspaper sunday , some 81 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of the federal government setting rules on smoking in bars and restaurants instead of ceding responsibility to the states . even so , the bild survey showed a lack of agreement as to what those rules should be .
some 20 percent of respondents opposed a ban while 56 percent supported a smoking ban with exceptions – such as for small corner pubs .
just 23 percent wanted all bars and restaurants to be smoke-free . still , kuenast said that the green party would seek a nationwide ban on the basis of worker safety , which is regulated by the federal government . as the laws stand now , each state has been able to devise its own regulations against smoking .
in bavaria , that means smokers get a reprieve during the state 's annual oktoberfest , when the beer tents synonymous with the festival become smoking zones . calls for consistency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer tents at oktoberfest : still a smoking zone .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , premier of the german state of hesse , said , however , that the states themselves could develop their own comprehensive smoking ban and he 's promised to put that issue on the agenda of the next meeting of state premiers in dresden in october .
" it is sensible for the states to reach as much of an amicable consensus on non-smoker protection as possible and to prevent a patchwork of regulations across the country , " koch said .
" we should also agree not to turn this into a political debate . " marlies volkmer , the social democratic spokeswoman for the german parliament 's committee for nutrition , agriculture and consumer protection , agreed . " the state parliaments are now called upon to use their discretion in order to impose a general smoking ban , " she said .

" we need everybody to work together .
players should be given the opportunity of playing at the olympics .

7 , a day ahead of the official opening of the beijing olympics .
the tournament is open to players under the age of 23 , but three clubs have appealed to the court of arbitration for sport -lrb- cas -rrb- for the return of their players who are already in china . german clubs werder bremen and schalke 04 , as well as barcelona , have approached cas about their players diego , rafinha and lionel messi , respectively . blatter told a news conference at the beijing main press center that whatever the outcome before the world 's highest sports arbitration body , due in the next two days , fifa would tell the players to stay and play . " we are bound by the decisions of cas , but even if it is a decision that is negative for the players , i would say : let them play .

" the olympic body will allow just one team , britain , " blatter said . the 72-year-old , who said that this tournament was a special one because it marked 100 years of olympic soccer , thanked the ioc for allowing 12 women teams and 16 men teams to participate . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but can the military help cut crime ? the controversial deployment of nearly 3,000 troops throughout italy was introduced by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right government as a move that would help combat crime .
the government , which took office in april after berlusconi successfully campaigned on a law-and-order platform , has linked crime and illegal immigration and passed a series of measures aimed at cracking down on both .
to that end , the government began a six-month deployment of hundreds of troops who now join local police forces in urban centers like rome , naples , and milan , according to press reports from those cities .
another 1,000 of the troops went to embassies , railway stations , churches , and other sensitive places where tourists tend to congregate .
the soldiers there have been authorized to only make arrests when they catch people actually committing a crime .
the remaining third have been sent to guard holding centers for illegal immigrants .
on the island of lampedusa , where thousands of migrants have arrived from africa in recent months seeking to enter europe , 70 air force troops were supplementing police who patrol the perimeter of a reception center .

"
opposition leaders have criticized the move , however , labeling it as " propaganda " and questioning its effectiveness in combating crime .
they have argued instead that more funds and other resources should have been provided to the police .
a union representing the police , coisp , also slammed the decision , and in a statement welcomed the fact that no soldiers are to be deployed in venice .
" we 're off the hook -lrb- in venice -rrb- because for every three soldiers deployed , one police or carabinieri -lrb- paramilitary police -rrb- needs to be provided as backup , " coisp said in a statement .

but can the military help cut crime ? the controversial deployment of nearly 3,000 troops throughout italy was introduced by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right government as a move that would help combat crime .
the government , which took office in april after berlusconi successfully campaigned on a law-and-order platform , has linked crime and illegal immigration and passed a series of measures aimed at cracking down on both .
to that end , the government began a six-month deployment of hundreds of troops who now join local police forces in urban centers like rome , naples , and milan , according to press reports from those cities .
another 1,000 of the troops went to embassies , railway stations , churches , and other sensitive places where tourists tend to congregate .
the soldiers there have been authorized to only make arrests when they catch people actually committing a crime .
the remaining third have been sent to guard holding centers for illegal immigrants .
on the island of lampedusa , where thousands of migrants have arrived from africa in recent months seeking to enter europe , 70 air force troops were supplementing police who patrol the perimeter of a reception center .

" companies ' expectations for the next six months are terribly bad , " carstensen said .
though order books are full right now , there are no new orders , carstensen warned .
" the upturn will definitely be over in winter .
many companies will gradually start cutting back on production and also lay off staff . "
the newspaper reported that german companies rated their order situation to be the worst in two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal industry is worried about getting new orders germany 's engineering and electronics employer group , gesamtmetall also voiced worries about the effects of a cooling global economy .
" the global economic slowdown is increasingly affecting the metal and electronics industry , " gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser told bild .
" in many companies , there 's enough work to last only until the end of the year . "
" heading towards zero " the news comes on the heels of top german carmakers showing signs of suffering from the global downturn .
last friday , bmw said it would miss its 2008 targets , following rival daimler with a profit warning as soaring oil and raw materials costs combined with a faltering us economy begin to bite the auto sector .
" the downturn will last longer and hit harder than companies have so far assumed , " deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter told newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag on the weekend .
" on the labor market , there will be bad news during the whole of 2009 . "
german joblessness fell by 20,000 on the month in july to 3.250 million .
however , economists say falling unemployment will soon be overtaken by developments in the broader economy and warn that the buoyancy of the labor market will not last .
buffeted by the global credit crisis , a weakening us economy and soaring prices for oil and raw materials , the clouds over the german economy have grown since the start of the year .
" the idea that we can continue to grow briskly with the few countries that are ticking along is unrealistic , in light of the numerous countries that are no longer ticking along , " walter told tagesspiegel am sonntag .

" companies ' expectations for the next six months are terribly bad , " carstensen said .
though order books are full right now , there are no new orders , carstensen warned .
" the upturn will definitely be over in winter .
many companies will gradually start cutting back on production and also lay off staff . "
the newspaper reported that german companies rated their order situation to be the worst in two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal industry is worried about getting new orders germany 's engineering and electronics employer group , gesamtmetall also voiced worries about the effects of a cooling global economy .
" the global economic slowdown is increasingly affecting the metal and electronics industry , " gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser told bild .
" in many companies , there 's enough work to last only until the end of the year . "
" heading towards zero " the news comes on the heels of top german carmakers showing signs of suffering from the global downturn .
last friday , bmw said it would miss its 2008 targets , following rival daimler with a profit warning as soaring oil and raw materials costs combined with a faltering us economy begin to bite the auto sector .
" the downturn will last longer and hit harder than companies have so far assumed , " deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter told newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag on the weekend .
" on the labor market , there will be bad news during the whole of 2009 . "
german joblessness fell by 20,000 on the month in july to 3.250 million .
however , economists say falling unemployment will soon be overtaken by developments in the broader economy and warn that the buoyancy of the labor market will not last .
buffeted by the global credit crisis , a weakening us economy and soaring prices for oil and raw materials , the clouds over the german economy have grown since the start of the year .
" the idea that we can continue to grow briskly with the few countries that are ticking along is unrealistic , in light of the numerous countries that are no longer ticking along , " walter told tagesspiegel am sonntag .
" for years we had double-digit growth rates in exports , now we are heading towards zero , " he added .
growth slower in euro zone than in the us analysts have already begun reversing downward their growth projections for europe 's largest economy .
the german finance ministry said last week that german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrank considerably in the second quarter after a strong start to the year , when europe 's largest economy expanded at its fastest rate since 1996 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retail sales in germany have fallen amid a downbeat mood among consumers german business daily handelsblatt said that based on a survey of 10 leading german and international banks and research institutes , big german companies will have to reckon with shrinking profits this year .
hopes that europe could isolate itself from the economic crisis in the us have evaporated , the paper said .
instead , current forecasts show that both economic growth and rise in profits in the euro zone in 2008 may be slower than in the us , the paper said .
the experts surveyed by the paper expect growth of just 0.9 percent in the euro zone for next year as against 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2.7 percent in 2007 .
in june , the european central bank had forecast a growth rate of 1.5 percent for the euro zone in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
unless iran responds " unambigiously and positively " to the latest incentive package by tuesday , aug 5 , the country will face sanctions , several countries warned on monday .
iran was offered a set of trade and economic incentives in mid-july which were aimed at convincing the country to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
but iran missed an informal saturday deadline to respond to the incentives package .
patience nearly worn out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atom symbol over iran flag jalili reportedly promised that tehran would provide a written response on tuesday to the incentives package , according to the us state department .

britain took the same line : " unless tomorrow 's answer is unambiguous and positive , we will have no choice but to proceed with further sanctions measures , " a foreign office spokesman told reuters news agency .
france also showed that it is unwilling to wait much longer .
" if we do n't get an encouraging response from the iranians , we will have to show firmness , resort to sanctions as in the past , " jean-pierre lacroix , france 's deputy ambassador to the un , told afp on monday .

a spokesman for solana confirmed to afp news agency that the phone call had taken place , but did not mention any promise by jalili to provide a written response by tuesday .
iranian media reported that in the telphone call " both sides agreed to continue talks . "

dw-world.de spoke to the german olympic sports federation amid a growing debate on human rights as the beijing olympics loom . this weekend , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering called on athletes traveling to the beijing olympics to protest against human rights violations in tibet .
" each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
last week , under the slogan " we are all chinese , " nine german olympians posed in their sports kit for a munich magazine while holding pictures of chinese dissidents in front of their faces .
many of the national olympic committees -lrb- nocs -rrb- have been criticized by human rights groups for their stances on the situation in china and the regulations that some of them have applied to their athletes traveling to beijing as the debate over press freedom and human rights abuses intensifies in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing , dw-world.de spoke to michael schirp , head of the media department at the german olympic s ports federation ’ s -lrb- dosb -rrb- about what 's acceptable and what 's not .
dw-world.de : amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has called for the dosb to clarify its rules on political protests by athletes .
has the dosb taken any action on this or does it believe the rules are clear ?
michael schirp : dosb states that rules have been made clear by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- .
in germany , the dosb has explained the rules both in public and on the german team 's internal olympic web site . generally , athletes are free to say what they think , be it inside or outside of the olympic venues .
they may express their opinions in press conferences or even in the mixed zones , in our “ deutsches haus ” or anywhere else .
there is only one issue that is prohibited according to the ioc charter : the showing of signs , flags , bracelets , pins , banners with political , racial , ethnic , religious content or propaganda if shown inside of areas where an accreditation is needed such as the olympic venues .
apart from that , amnesty international and the dosb have worked together on the subject of human rights since may 2007 .
amnesty international has criticized the dosb for saying that the wearing of wristbands -lrb- ai 's “ gold for human rights ” or the german athletes ' “ sports for human rights ” bands -rrb- are forbidden as they are political statements .
does this ruling still stand ?
what is the dosb 's definition of a political statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german olympic team with president horst koehler i would point you to my first answer .
this is not limited to olympic games .
you 'll find this in any major sport event .
if every political , religious or ethnic conflict in the world would be carried into sporting events , the weight of such statements would be marginalized anyway .
but the most important thing is to keep these conflicts out of the event itself .
sport is intended to build bridges , not to further build walls .
it is only at the olympic games that 205 nocs and the countries they represent come together in a peaceful competition .
what are the dosb guidelines in terms of punishments for athletes who make political statements or protests in beijing ?
we do n't have any of those .
we are sure athletes are aware of their responsibility and have made up their minds regarding human rights in china .
they will find ways to express their opinion or , if they choose , not to , which also has to be respected as their free will .
before the chinese crackdown in tibet , neither the ioc nor dosb mentioned anything about china 's human rights record .
did the tibet situation force the olympic committees to accept that china had a human rights problem ?
to be perfectly blunt , this is just wrong .
before tibet , the media were not interested in sporting organizations which dealt with the issue .
it was in may 2007 , almost a year before the incidents in tibet , that the dosb published a declaration on human rights in china .
this was unique at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against china 's tibet policy marred the olympic torch relay in europe we clearly stated that we consider the situation to be unsatisfactory .
but we are a sport organization and can not solve the problems that the un and others could n't solve for 50 years .

we repeated this during easter 2008 and urged the parties in tibet to stop violence and bloodshed .

verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .
on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .
they say that it is up to the ioc as the dosb does not have any leverage - since the dosb president thomas bach is also the vice-president of the ioc , we should see very soon whether they are really serious about this . nick amies interviewed verena harpe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics china has sparked criticism by blocking access to controversial web sites ahead of the olympic games , despite promises to provide open access .

"
unless iran responds " unambigiously and positively " to the latest incentive package by tuesday , aug 5 , the country will face sanctions , several countries warned on monday .
iran was offered a set of trade and economic incentives in mid-july which were aimed at convincing the country to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
but iran missed an informal saturday deadline to respond to the incentives package .
patience nearly worn out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atom symbol over iran flag jalili reportedly promised that tehran would provide a written response on tuesday to the incentives package , according to the us state department .
besides the us , the five other countries involved in negotiations with iran are britain , france , germany , russia and china .
diplomats from the group of six agreed to push for new action against iran if the country continues to stall , according to us state department spokesman gonzago gallegos .
" we agreed that in the absence of a positive response , we have no choice but to pursue further measures , " gallegos said monday .
britain took the same line : " unless tomorrow 's answer is unambiguous and positive , we will have no choice but to proceed with further sanctions measures , " a foreign office spokesman told reuters news agency .
france also showed that it is unwilling to wait much longer .
" if we do n't get an encouraging response from the iranians , we will have to show firmness , resort to sanctions as in the past , " jean-pierre lacroix , france 's deputy ambassador to the un , told afp on monday .
iran takes different view bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has refused to stop its nuclear program iran is already living with three sets of sanctions imposed by the united nations .
tehran has consistently refused to suspend its nuclear activities , which it claims will be used for energy production .
europe and other countries worry that iran wants to develop nuclear weapons .
a spokesman for solana confirmed to afp news agency that the phone call had taken place , but did not mention any promise by jalili to provide a written response by tuesday .
iranian media reported that in the telphone call " both sides agreed to continue talks . "

german politicians are calling for a comprehensive , nationwide law against smoking on the heels of the recent ruling by the german constitutional court to partially overturn bans in several german states . after years of dragging its feet on implementing a smoking ban , germany went smoke-free in bars and restaurants this year in a move that has both raised hackles and won praise .
so last wednesday 's court ruling , which found that individual state laws allowing bars to set up separate smoking and non-smoking areas gave large multi-room pubs an advantage over smaller one-room pubs , was one that was met with fierce debate . renate kuenast , the parliamentary co-leader of the opposition green party , criticized the federal government in comments on the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel on sunday .
" it was an act of cowardice to leave protection of non-smokers up to the states , " kuenast said . germans in favor of federal rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rule reversal now allows smoking in one-room pubs that 's a sentiment that many germans are echoing .
in a survey by the emnid institute that was published in the bild am sonntag newspaper sunday , some 81 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of the federal government setting rules on smoking in bars and restaurants instead of ceding responsibility to the states . even so , the bild survey showed a lack of agreement as to what those rules should be .
some 20 percent of respondents opposed a ban while 56 percent supported a smoking ban with exceptions – such as for small corner pubs .
just 23 percent wanted all bars and restaurants to be smoke-free . still , kuenast said that the green party would seek a nationwide ban on the basis of worker safety , which is regulated by the federal government . as the laws stand now , each state has been able to devise its own regulations against smoking .
in bavaria , that means smokers get a reprieve during the state 's annual oktoberfest , when the beer tents synonymous with the festival become smoking zones . calls for consistency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer tents at oktoberfest : still a smoking zone .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , premier of the german state of hesse , said , however , that the states themselves could develop their own comprehensive smoking ban and he 's promised to put that issue on the agenda of the next meeting of state premiers in dresden in october .
" it is sensible for the states to reach as much of an amicable consensus on non-smoker protection as possible and to prevent a patchwork of regulations across the country , " koch said .
" we should also agree not to turn this into a political debate . " marlies volkmer , the social democratic spokeswoman for the german parliament 's committee for nutrition , agriculture and consumer protection , agreed . " the state parliaments are now called upon to use their discretion in order to impose a general smoking ban , " she said .
" only a consistent approach will truly serve health protection measures and would be completely clear for both pub owners and guests .
we must get rid of germany 's patchwork of different rules regarding smoking . " dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians are calling for a comprehensive , nationwide law against smoking on the heels of the recent ruling by the german constitutional court to partially overturn bans in several german states . after years of dragging its feet on implementing a smoking ban , germany went smoke-free in bars and restaurants this year in a move that has both raised hackles and won praise .
so last wednesday 's court ruling , which found that individual state laws allowing bars to set up separate smoking and non-smoking areas gave large multi-room pubs an advantage over smaller one-room pubs , was one that was met with fierce debate . renate kuenast , the parliamentary co-leader of the opposition green party , criticized the federal government in comments on the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel on sunday .
" it was an act of cowardice to leave protection of non-smokers up to the states , " kuenast said . germans in favor of federal rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rule reversal now allows smoking in one-room pubs that 's a sentiment that many germans are echoing .
in a survey by the emnid institute that was published in the bild am sonntag newspaper sunday , some 81 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of the federal government setting rules on smoking in bars and restaurants instead of ceding responsibility to the states . even so , the bild survey showed a lack of agreement as to what those rules should be .
some 20 percent of respondents opposed a ban while 56 percent supported a smoking ban with exceptions – such as for small corner pubs .
just 23 percent wanted all bars and restaurants to be smoke-free . still , kuenast said that the green party would seek a nationwide ban on the basis of worker safety , which is regulated by the federal government . as the laws stand now , each state has been able to devise its own regulations against smoking .
in bavaria , that means smokers get a reprieve during the state 's annual oktoberfest , when the beer tents synonymous with the festival become smoking zones . calls for consistency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer tents at oktoberfest : still a smoking zone .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , premier of the german state of hesse , said , however , that the states themselves could develop their own comprehensive smoking ban and he 's promised to put that issue on the agenda of the next meeting of state premiers in dresden in october .
" it is sensible for the states to reach as much of an amicable consensus on non-smoker protection as possible and to prevent a patchwork of regulations across the country , " koch said .
" we should also agree not to turn this into a political debate . " marlies volkmer , the social democratic spokeswoman for the german parliament 's committee for nutrition , agriculture and consumer protection , agreed . " the state parliaments are now called upon to use their discretion in order to impose a general smoking ban , " she said .

"
unless iran responds " unambigiously and positively " to the latest incentive package by tuesday , aug 5 , the country will face sanctions , several countries warned on monday .
iran was offered a set of trade and economic incentives in mid-july which were aimed at convincing the country to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
but iran missed an informal saturday deadline to respond to the incentives package .
patience nearly worn out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atom symbol over iran flag jalili reportedly promised that tehran would provide a written response on tuesday to the incentives package , according to the us state department .
besides the us , the five other countries involved in negotiations with iran are britain , france , germany , russia and china .
diplomats from the group of six agreed to push for new action against iran if the country continues to stall , according to us state department spokesman gonzago gallegos .
" we agreed that in the absence of a positive response , we have no choice but to pursue further measures , " gallegos said monday .
britain took the same line : " unless tomorrow 's answer is unambiguous and positive , we will have no choice but to proceed with further sanctions measures , " a foreign office spokesman told reuters news agency .
france also showed that it is unwilling to wait much longer .
" if we do n't get an encouraging response from the iranians , we will have to show firmness , resort to sanctions as in the past , " jean-pierre lacroix , france 's deputy ambassador to the un , told afp on monday .
iran takes different view bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has refused to stop its nuclear program iran is already living with three sets of sanctions imposed by the united nations .
tehran has consistently refused to suspend its nuclear activities , which it claims will be used for energy production .
europe and other countries worry that iran wants to develop nuclear weapons .
a spokesman for solana confirmed to afp news agency that the phone call had taken place , but did not mention any promise by jalili to provide a written response by tuesday .
iranian media reported that in the telphone call " both sides agreed to continue talks . "

the debate comes in the wake of an uproar over the paycheck of porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking .
in the past fiscal year the head of the luxury carmaker took home some 60 million euros -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- – more than a thousand times the average salary of an auto industry worker .
according to recent reports , wiedeking could take home 100 million euros for the current fiscal year .
decrying " blatant disparities " the spd laid out its own proposals several weeks ago , but the cdu is now setting forth its own ideas on how to limit manager pay .
according to the cdu plan , the complete supervisory board should get decision-making powers over individual pay in a manager 's contract .
moreover , executives would have a longer waiting period before they could exercise stock options .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's wiedeking : 100 million things to smile about according to handelsblatt , the cdu is joining the spd in trying to ratchet back the increases in german managers ' pay , which it considers to be excessive .
" blatant disparities and overly-high remuneration , despite apparent poor performance , should not be excused with references to the power of the free market , ” the paper said .
the cdu also wanted its proposals to apply to state-dominated institutions .
porsche ceo gets more the news of wiedeking 's coming windfall set off yet another debate among german politicians .
left party leader oskar lafontaine accused the governing grand coalition of being “ incapable of putting an end to managers ' brazen self-serving . ”

"
unless iran responds " unambigiously and positively " to the latest incentive package by tuesday , aug 5 , the country will face sanctions , several countries warned on monday .
iran was offered a set of trade and economic incentives in mid-july which were aimed at convincing the country to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
but iran missed an informal saturday deadline to respond to the incentives package .
patience nearly worn out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atom symbol over iran flag jalili reportedly promised that tehran would provide a written response on tuesday to the incentives package , according to the us state department .
besides the us , the five other countries involved in negotiations with iran are britain , france , germany , russia and china .
diplomats from the group of six agreed to push for new action against iran if the country continues to stall , according to us state department spokesman gonzago gallegos .
" we agreed that in the absence of a positive response , we have no choice but to pursue further measures , " gallegos said monday .
britain took the same line : " unless tomorrow 's answer is unambiguous and positive , we will have no choice but to proceed with further sanctions measures , " a foreign office spokesman told reuters news agency .
france also showed that it is unwilling to wait much longer .
" if we do n't get an encouraging response from the iranians , we will have to show firmness , resort to sanctions as in the past , " jean-pierre lacroix , france 's deputy ambassador to the un , told afp on monday .
iran takes different view bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has refused to stop its nuclear program iran is already living with three sets of sanctions imposed by the united nations .
tehran has consistently refused to suspend its nuclear activities , which it claims will be used for energy production .
europe and other countries worry that iran wants to develop nuclear weapons .
a spokesman for solana confirmed to afp news agency that the phone call had taken place , but did not mention any promise by jalili to provide a written response by tuesday .
iranian media reported that in the telphone call " both sides agreed to continue talks . "
" they also emphasized that preserving this path -lrb- talks -rrb- needs a positive and constructive atmosphere , " the television report said , according to afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but can the military help cut crime ? the controversial deployment of nearly 3,000 troops throughout italy was introduced by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right government as a move that would help combat crime .
the government , which took office in april after berlusconi successfully campaigned on a law-and-order platform , has linked crime and illegal immigration and passed a series of measures aimed at cracking down on both .
to that end , the government began a six-month deployment of hundreds of troops who now join local police forces in urban centers like rome , naples , and milan , according to press reports from those cities .
another 1,000 of the troops went to embassies , railway stations , churches , and other sensitive places where tourists tend to congregate .
the soldiers there have been authorized to only make arrests when they catch people actually committing a crime .

another 1,000 of the troops went to embassies , railway stations , churches , and other sensitive places where tourists tend to congregate .

" companies ' expectations for the next six months are terribly bad , " carstensen said .
though order books are full right now , there are no new orders , carstensen warned .
" the upturn will definitely be over in winter .
many companies will gradually start cutting back on production and also lay off staff . "
the newspaper reported that german companies rated their order situation to be the worst in two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal industry is worried about getting new orders germany 's engineering and electronics employer group , gesamtmetall also voiced worries about the effects of a cooling global economy .
" the global economic slowdown is increasingly affecting the metal and electronics industry , " gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser told bild .
" in many companies , there 's enough work to last only until the end of the year . "
" heading towards zero " the news comes on the heels of top german carmakers showing signs of suffering from the global downturn .
last friday , bmw said it would miss its 2008 targets , following rival daimler with a profit warning as soaring oil and raw materials costs combined with a faltering us economy begin to bite the auto sector .
" the downturn will last longer and hit harder than companies have so far assumed , " deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter told newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag on the weekend .
" on the labor market , there will be bad news during the whole of 2009 . "
german joblessness fell by 20,000 on the month in july to 3.250 million .
however , economists say falling unemployment will soon be overtaken by developments in the broader economy and warn that the buoyancy of the labor market will not last .
buffeted by the global credit crisis , a weakening us economy and soaring prices for oil and raw materials , the clouds over the german economy have grown since the start of the year .
" the idea that we can continue to grow briskly with the few countries that are ticking along is unrealistic , in light of the numerous countries that are no longer ticking along , " walter told tagesspiegel am sonntag .
" for years we had double-digit growth rates in exports , now we are heading towards zero , " he added .
growth slower in euro zone than in the us analysts have already begun reversing downward their growth projections for europe 's largest economy .
the german finance ministry said last week that german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrank considerably in the second quarter after a strong start to the year , when europe 's largest economy expanded at its fastest rate since 1996 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retail sales in germany have fallen amid a downbeat mood among consumers german business daily handelsblatt said that based on a survey of 10 leading german and international banks and research institutes , big german companies will have to reckon with shrinking profits this year .
hopes that europe could isolate itself from the economic crisis in the us have evaporated , the paper said .
instead , current forecasts show that both economic growth and rise in profits in the euro zone in 2008 may be slower than in the us , the paper said .
the experts surveyed by the paper expect growth of just 0.9 percent in the euro zone for next year as against 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2.7 percent in 2007 .
in june , the european central bank had forecast a growth rate of 1.5 percent for the euro zone in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debate comes in the wake of an uproar over the paycheck of porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking .
in the past fiscal year the head of the luxury carmaker took home some 60 million euros -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- – more than a thousand times the average salary of an auto industry worker .
according to recent reports , wiedeking could take home 100 million euros for the current fiscal year .
decrying " blatant disparities " the spd laid out its own proposals several weeks ago , but the cdu is now setting forth its own ideas on how to limit manager pay .
according to the cdu plan , the complete supervisory board should get decision-making powers over individual pay in a manager 's contract .
moreover , executives would have a longer waiting period before they could exercise stock options .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's wiedeking : 100 million things to smile about according to handelsblatt , the cdu is joining the spd in trying to ratchet back the increases in german managers ' pay , which it considers to be excessive .
" blatant disparities and overly-high remuneration , despite apparent poor performance , should not be excused with references to the power of the free market , ” the paper said .
the cdu also wanted its proposals to apply to state-dominated institutions .
porsche ceo gets more the news of wiedeking 's coming windfall set off yet another debate among german politicians .
left party leader oskar lafontaine accused the governing grand coalition of being “ incapable of putting an end to managers ' brazen self-serving . ”

conflicting voices only add to the confusion and contradiction . the beijing summer olympics begin on aug 8 and while the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- hopes that most eyes will be on the sporting prowess on the track and field , no-one is under any illusion that the focus will also be on events outside the glittering arenas .
the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .
but attempting to get a clear view of the current state-of-play is as difficult as peering through the beijing smog on a hazy summer morning .
those looking for evidence of change , whether positive or negative , must rely on the statements of the various parties involved in the human rights debate .
do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up to the beijing olympics has been marked by protests around the world there are tangible examples of minor improvements , however .
after increasing pressure from world leaders and the united nations , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review in 2007 which means that every death sentence must now be heard by the top court .
before that , it was left to the local courts to decide and without strict judicial review there were many miscarriages of justice .
china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .
there will be no censorship on the internet . "
rogge explained that foreign journalists can now travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
" we also realised that there were abuses in the factories making mascots and material for bocog -lrb- the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad -rrb- , " he added .
" the chinese reacted very well .
they arrested those responsible and had a new law passed .
" the third thing was to obtain proper compensation for people dispossessed by the olympic building projects .
the fourth was new legislation for protecting the environment .
on these four points we achieved satisfaction . "
journalists being stymied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups have stepped up criticism of the chinese regime all of these measures sound like definite progress has been made , until one hears from the other side of the argument .
“ this increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story , ” verena harpe , the china expert at amnesty international germany 's asia desk told dw-world.de. harpe said increased mobility for foreign journalists was likely to last only last until after the paralympics in october . she pointed out that correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
" while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented , " she said .
harpe also explained that the people that journalists most want to talk to , usually those most interesting in terms of the situation in china , are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
reports of harassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch relay met with protests amnesty also challenges rogge 's claim that the ioc had helped bring in a law for compensation payments for persons displaced due to olympic construction .
harpe gave the example of a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction .
" he was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions , ” she said .
“ he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october - after the games . "
the reason is that foreign journalists would want to talk to him , harpe said , adding that intimidation and harassment as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
internet censorship continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some internet sites in the press center are blocked rogge 's claim that there would be no censorship of the internet in china also does n't hold water . “ the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was , ” harpe said .
“ even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to ‘ sensitive ' websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them . "
these so-called “ sensitive ” sites which have been shut down include independent new services , blogs attempting to get uncensored news out of china , and international broadcasters which have been deemed dangerous by the chinese government , dw-world.de 's chinese page included .
situation not getting any better amnesty 's harpe believes that behind these claims of progress , the human rights situation has actually worsened , not in spite of the olympics but because of them .
“ in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues , ” she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese police lay low during the olympics ?
to obtain lasting human rights reforms , amnesty international says that governments and olympic committees should move away from the “ quiet diplomacy ” promoted by the ioc and publicly criticize china ; despite claims that to do business with china it has to happen behind closed doors .
“ it is unlikely that the change in the death sentence review would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though public pressure has worked , ” harpe said .
but with the ioc and world leaders like french president nicolas sarkozy unwilling , or unable , to confront china publicly , further improvements - however minor - seem unlikely as the games approach . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up to the beijing olympics has been marked by protests around the world there are tangible examples of minor improvements , however .
after increasing pressure from world leaders and the united nations , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review in 2007 which means that every death sentence must now be heard by the top court .
before that , it was left to the local courts to decide and without strict judicial review there were many miscarriages of justice .
china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .
there will be no censorship on the internet . "
rogge explained that foreign journalists can now travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
" we also realised that there were abuses in the factories making mascots and material for bocog -lrb- the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad -rrb- , " he added .
" the chinese reacted very well .
they arrested those responsible and had a new law passed .
" the third thing was to obtain proper compensation for people dispossessed by the olympic building projects .
the fourth was new legislation for protecting the environment .
on these four points we achieved satisfaction . "
journalists being stymied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups have stepped up criticism of the chinese regime all of these measures sound like definite progress has been made , until one hears from the other side of the argument .
“ this increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story , ” verena harpe , the china expert at amnesty international germany 's asia desk told dw-world.de. harpe said increased mobility for foreign journalists was likely to last only last until after the paralympics in october . she pointed out that correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
" while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented , " she said .
harpe also explained that the people that journalists most want to talk to , usually those most interesting in terms of the situation in china , are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
reports of harassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch relay met with protests amnesty also challenges rogge 's claim that the ioc had helped bring in a law for compensation payments for persons displaced due to olympic construction .
harpe gave the example of a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction .
" he was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions , ” she said .
“ he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october - after the games . "
the reason is that foreign journalists would want to talk to him , harpe said , adding that intimidation and harassment as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
internet censorship continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some internet sites in the press center are blocked rogge 's claim that there would be no censorship of the internet in china also does n't hold water . “ the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was , ” harpe said .
“ even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to ‘ sensitive ' websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them . "
these so-called “ sensitive ” sites which have been shut down include independent new services , blogs attempting to get uncensored news out of china , and international broadcasters which have been deemed dangerous by the chinese government , dw-world.de 's chinese page included .
situation not getting any better amnesty 's harpe believes that behind these claims of progress , the human rights situation has actually worsened , not in spite of the olympics but because of them .
“ in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues , ” she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese police lay low during the olympics ?
to obtain lasting human rights reforms , amnesty international says that governments and olympic committees should move away from the “ quiet diplomacy ” promoted by the ioc and publicly criticize china ; despite claims that to do business with china it has to happen behind closed doors .
“ it is unlikely that the change in the death sentence review would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though public pressure has worked , ” harpe said .

conflicting voices only add to the confusion and contradiction . the beijing summer olympics begin on aug 8 and while the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- hopes that most eyes will be on the sporting prowess on the track and field , no-one is under any illusion that the focus will also be on events outside the glittering arenas .
the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .

dw-world.de spoke to the german olympic sports federation amid a growing debate on human rights as the beijing olympics loom . this weekend , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering called on athletes traveling to the beijing olympics to protest against human rights violations in tibet .
" each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
last week , under the slogan " we are all chinese , " nine german olympians posed in their sports kit for a munich magazine while holding pictures of chinese dissidents in front of their faces .
many of the national olympic committees -lrb- nocs -rrb- have been criticized by human rights groups for their stances on the situation in china and the regulations that some of them have applied to their athletes traveling to beijing as the debate over press freedom and human rights abuses intensifies in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing , dw-world.de spoke to michael schirp , head of the media department at the german olympic s ports federation ’ s -lrb- dosb -rrb- about what 's acceptable and what 's not .
dw-world.de : amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has called for the dosb to clarify its rules on political protests by athletes .
has the dosb taken any action on this or does it believe the rules are clear ?
michael schirp : dosb states that rules have been made clear by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- .
in germany , the dosb has explained the rules both in public and on the german team 's internal olympic web site . generally , athletes are free to say what they think , be it inside or outside of the olympic venues .
they may express their opinions in press conferences or even in the mixed zones , in our “ deutsches haus ” or anywhere else .
there is only one issue that is prohibited according to the ioc charter : the showing of signs , flags , bracelets , pins , banners with political , racial , ethnic , religious content or propaganda if shown inside of areas where an accreditation is needed such as the olympic venues .
apart from that , amnesty international and the dosb have worked together on the subject of human rights since may 2007 .
amnesty international has criticized the dosb for saying that the wearing of wristbands -lrb- ai 's “ gold for human rights ” or the german athletes ' “ sports for human rights ” bands -rrb- are forbidden as they are political statements .
does this ruling still stand ?
what is the dosb 's definition of a political statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german olympic team with president horst koehler i would point you to my first answer .
this is not limited to olympic games .
you 'll find this in any major sport event .
if every political , religious or ethnic conflict in the world would be carried into sporting events , the weight of such statements would be marginalized anyway .
but the most important thing is to keep these conflicts out of the event itself .
sport is intended to build bridges , not to further build walls .
it is only at the olympic games that 205 nocs and the countries they represent come together in a peaceful competition .
what are the dosb guidelines in terms of punishments for athletes who make political statements or protests in beijing ?
we do n't have any of those .
we are sure athletes are aware of their responsibility and have made up their minds regarding human rights in china .
they will find ways to express their opinion or , if they choose , not to , which also has to be respected as their free will .
before the chinese crackdown in tibet , neither the ioc nor dosb mentioned anything about china 's human rights record .
did the tibet situation force the olympic committees to accept that china had a human rights problem ?
to be perfectly blunt , this is just wrong .
before tibet , the media were not interested in sporting organizations which dealt with the issue .
it was in may 2007 , almost a year before the incidents in tibet , that the dosb published a declaration on human rights in china .
this was unique at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against china 's tibet policy marred the olympic torch relay in europe we clearly stated that we consider the situation to be unsatisfactory .
but we are a sport organization and can not solve the problems that the un and others could n't solve for 50 years .
sport is communication , not isolation .
we repeated this during easter 2008 and urged the parties in tibet to stop violence and bloodshed .
again , this was all published .
amnesty international has said that it has held meetings with the dosb to discuss human right .
what has been the outcome of the meetings with ai ?
this was just the start .
cooperation with ai , human rights watch and the human rights spokesperson of the german government continues .
all three of them have met with the team leaders in an attempt to pass on their information to the olympic team .
the team 's internal web site provides all this information .
in addition , every german athlete who goes to beijing carries with him or her material from these human rights organizations and the un . nick amies interviewed michael schirp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 04.08.2008 italy deploys troops in cities to tackle crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian soldiers now patrol parts of rome , naples , and milan an anti-crime measure in italy has some 3,000 troops taking up positions and patrolling streets in cities across the country monday .
but can the military help cut crime ? the controversial deployment of nearly 3,000 troops throughout italy was introduced by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right government as a move that would help combat crime .
the government , which took office in april after berlusconi successfully campaigned on a law-and-order platform , has linked crime and illegal immigration and passed a series of measures aimed at cracking down on both .
to that end , the government began a six-month deployment of hundreds of troops who now join local police forces in urban centers like rome , naples , and milan , according to press reports from those cities .
another 1,000 of the troops went to embassies , railway stations , churches , and other sensitive places where tourists tend to congregate .
the soldiers there have been authorized to only make arrests when they catch people actually committing a crime .
the remaining third have been sent to guard holding centers for illegal immigrants .
on the island of lampedusa , where thousands of migrants have arrived from africa in recent months seeking to enter europe , 70 air force troops were supplementing police who patrol the perimeter of a reception center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops were likewise deployed to the immigrant holding center at lampedusa claims of increased security have opposition crying foul interior minister roberto maroni of the anti-immigrant northern league said he wants to " give the public a better perception of security . "
opposition leaders have criticized the move , however , labeling it as " propaganda " and questioning its effectiveness in combating crime .
they have argued instead that more funds and other resources should have been provided to the police .
a union representing the police , coisp , also slammed the decision , and in a statement welcomed the fact that no soldiers are to be deployed in venice .
" we 're off the hook -lrb- in venice -rrb- because for every three soldiers deployed , one police or carabinieri -lrb- paramilitary police -rrb- needs to be provided as backup , " coisp said in a statement .
" where are we going to find extra police ? "
coisp asked , lamenting what it said was a scarcity of fuel for police squad cars and a lack of overtime pay for police officers .
rome rejects " militarization " of its city center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's mayor wo n't allow troops in the city 's historic district rome 's mayor , gianni alemanno likewise hit back , refusing to allow the troops to patrol the historic city center , where the majority of tourists spend their time .
he said he feared that the " militarization " of the capital would scare away visitors .
officials , however , downplayed the decision to draft in troops .
" in 1992 , 20,000 men were sent to sicily alone " to aid police in fighting the mafia after the murder of two judges , deputy chief of the general staff general mario buscemi was quoted by daily la repubblica as saying .
in comparision , this smaller deployment would be minor and essentially symbolic , he said . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

conflicting voices only add to the confusion and contradiction . the beijing summer olympics begin on aug 8 and while the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- hopes that most eyes will be on the sporting prowess on the track and field , no-one is under any illusion that the focus will also be on events outside the glittering arenas .
the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .
but attempting to get a clear view of the current state-of-play is as difficult as peering through the beijing smog on a hazy summer morning .
those looking for evidence of change , whether positive or negative , must rely on the statements of the various parties involved in the human rights debate .
do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up to the beijing olympics has been marked by protests around the world there are tangible examples of minor improvements , however .
after increasing pressure from world leaders and the united nations , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review in 2007 which means that every death sentence must now be heard by the top court .
before that , it was left to the local courts to decide and without strict judicial review there were many miscarriages of justice .
china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .
there will be no censorship on the internet . "
rogge explained that foreign journalists can now travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
" we also realised that there were abuses in the factories making mascots and material for bocog -lrb- the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad -rrb- , " he added .
" the chinese reacted very well .
they arrested those responsible and had a new law passed .
" the third thing was to obtain proper compensation for people dispossessed by the olympic building projects .
the fourth was new legislation for protecting the environment .
on these four points we achieved satisfaction . "
journalists being stymied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups have stepped up criticism of the chinese regime all of these measures sound like definite progress has been made , until one hears from the other side of the argument .
“ this increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story , ” verena harpe , the china expert at amnesty international germany 's asia desk told dw-world.de. harpe said increased mobility for foreign journalists was likely to last only last until after the paralympics in october . she pointed out that correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
" while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented , " she said .
harpe also explained that the people that journalists most want to talk to , usually those most interesting in terms of the situation in china , are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
reports of harassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch relay met with protests amnesty also challenges rogge 's claim that the ioc had helped bring in a law for compensation payments for persons displaced due to olympic construction .
harpe gave the example of a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction .
" he was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions , ” she said .
“ he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october - after the games . "
the reason is that foreign journalists would want to talk to him , harpe said , adding that intimidation and harassment as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
internet censorship continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some internet sites in the press center are blocked rogge 's claim that there would be no censorship of the internet in china also does n't hold water . “ the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was , ” harpe said .
“ even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to ‘ sensitive ' websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them . "
these so-called “ sensitive ” sites which have been shut down include independent new services , blogs attempting to get uncensored news out of china , and international broadcasters which have been deemed dangerous by the chinese government , dw-world.de 's chinese page included .
situation not getting any better amnesty 's harpe believes that behind these claims of progress , the human rights situation has actually worsened , not in spite of the olympics but because of them .
“ in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues , ” she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese police lay low during the olympics ?
to obtain lasting human rights reforms , amnesty international says that governments and olympic committees should move away from the “ quiet diplomacy ” promoted by the ioc and publicly criticize china ; despite claims that to do business with china it has to happen behind closed doors .
“ it is unlikely that the change in the death sentence review would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though public pressure has worked , ” harpe said .
but with the ioc and world leaders like french president nicolas sarkozy unwilling , or unable , to confront china publicly , further improvements - however minor - seem unlikely as the games approach . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

conflicting voices only add to the confusion and contradiction . the beijing summer olympics begin on aug 8 and while the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- hopes that most eyes will be on the sporting prowess on the track and field , no-one is under any illusion that the focus will also be on events outside the glittering arenas .
the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .
but attempting to get a clear view of the current state-of-play is as difficult as peering through the beijing smog on a hazy summer morning .
those looking for evidence of change , whether positive or negative , must rely on the statements of the various parties involved in the human rights debate .
do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up to the beijing olympics has been marked by protests around the world there are tangible examples of minor improvements , however .
after increasing pressure from world leaders and the united nations , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review in 2007 which means that every death sentence must now be heard by the top court .
before that , it was left to the local courts to decide and without strict judicial review there were many miscarriages of justice .
china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .
there will be no censorship on the internet . "
rogge explained that foreign journalists can now travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
" we also realised that there were abuses in the factories making mascots and material for bocog -lrb- the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad -rrb- , " he added .
" the chinese reacted very well .
they arrested those responsible and had a new law passed .
" the third thing was to obtain proper compensation for people dispossessed by the olympic building projects .
the fourth was new legislation for protecting the environment .
on these four points we achieved satisfaction . "
journalists being stymied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups have stepped up criticism of the chinese regime all of these measures sound like definite progress has been made , until one hears from the other side of the argument .
“ this increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story , ” verena harpe , the china expert at amnesty international germany 's asia desk told dw-world.de. harpe said increased mobility for foreign journalists was likely to last only last until after the paralympics in october . she pointed out that correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
" while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented , " she said .
harpe also explained that the people that journalists most want to talk to , usually those most interesting in terms of the situation in china , are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
reports of harassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch relay met with protests amnesty also challenges rogge 's claim that the ioc had helped bring in a law for compensation payments for persons displaced due to olympic construction .
harpe gave the example of a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction .
" he was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions , ” she said .
“ he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october - after the games . "
the reason is that foreign journalists would want to talk to him , harpe said , adding that intimidation and harassment as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
internet censorship continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some internet sites in the press center are blocked rogge 's claim that there would be no censorship of the internet in china also does n't hold water . “ the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was , ” harpe said .
“ even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to ‘ sensitive ' websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them . "
these so-called “ sensitive ” sites which have been shut down include independent new services , blogs attempting to get uncensored news out of china , and international broadcasters which have been deemed dangerous by the chinese government , dw-world.de 's chinese page included .
situation not getting any better amnesty 's harpe believes that behind these claims of progress , the human rights situation has actually worsened , not in spite of the olympics but because of them .
“ in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues , ” she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese police lay low during the olympics ?
to obtain lasting human rights reforms , amnesty international says that governments and olympic committees should move away from the “ quiet diplomacy ” promoted by the ioc and publicly criticize china ; despite claims that to do business with china it has to happen behind closed doors .
“ it is unlikely that the change in the death sentence review would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though public pressure has worked , ” harpe said .

conflicting voices only add to the confusion and contradiction . the beijing summer olympics begin on aug 8 and while the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- hopes that most eyes will be on the sporting prowess on the track and field , no-one is under any illusion that the focus will also be on events outside the glittering arenas .
the beijing olympics have already become synonymous with china 's human rights record ; the build-up to the global sporting spectacle has been dominated by the on-going debate over china 's suitability as host , its record on human rights and the growing protest movement the situation has attracted .
but attempting to get a clear view of the current state-of-play is as difficult as peering through the beijing smog on a hazy summer morning .
those looking for evidence of change , whether positive or negative , must rely on the statements of the various parties involved in the human rights debate .
do n't take china 's word for it china itself is hardly an impartial source ; the people 's republic strives to promote a sunny view while shielding hard facts behind a blanket of state secrecy .
the ioc and the national olympic committees also have a vested interest in presenting an optimistic view while the rights organizations have their own agendas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up to the beijing olympics has been marked by protests around the world there are tangible examples of minor improvements , however .
after increasing pressure from world leaders and the united nations , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review in 2007 which means that every death sentence must now be heard by the top court .
before that , it was left to the local courts to decide and without strict judicial review there were many miscarriages of justice .
china - which hands down more death sentences than any other country on earth - says this review has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , which include many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this reform may not have been a direct result of the olympic games coming to beijing .
but the media glare that has accompanied china 's olympic preparations has also brought its record on executions to a wider audience . olympic pressure played a role improvements resulting directly from pressure associated with the olympic games are harder to define .
for these , one has to rely on the testimony of the ioc .
in july , president jacques rogge stated that after what he called the ioc 's “ quiet diplomacy , ” china had been persuaded to pass three news laws to protect child labourers , media rights and the environment .
another measure secured compensation for residents made homeless to make way for the games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china hopes the focus will stay on the athletic prowess at the games " we have obtained a new law on the media which is perhaps not perfect , but is a remarkable step forward for china , " rogge said in a statement .
" for the first time , foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china .
there will be no censorship on the internet . "
rogge explained that foreign journalists can now travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
" we also realised that there were abuses in the factories making mascots and material for bocog -lrb- the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad -rrb- , " he added .
" the chinese reacted very well .
they arrested those responsible and had a new law passed .
" the third thing was to obtain proper compensation for people dispossessed by the olympic building projects .
the fourth was new legislation for protecting the environment .
on these four points we achieved satisfaction . "
journalists being stymied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups have stepped up criticism of the chinese regime all of these measures sound like definite progress has been made , until one hears from the other side of the argument .
“ this increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story , ” verena harpe , the china expert at amnesty international germany 's asia desk told dw-world.de. harpe said increased mobility for foreign journalists was likely to last only last until after the paralympics in october . she pointed out that correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
" while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented , " she said .
harpe also explained that the people that journalists most want to talk to , usually those most interesting in terms of the situation in china , are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
reports of harassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch relay met with protests amnesty also challenges rogge 's claim that the ioc had helped bring in a law for compensation payments for persons displaced due to olympic construction .
harpe gave the example of a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction .
" he was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions , ” she said .
“ he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october - after the games . "
the reason is that foreign journalists would want to talk to him , harpe said , adding that intimidation and harassment as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
internet censorship continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some internet sites in the press center are blocked rogge 's claim that there would be no censorship of the internet in china also does n't hold water . “ the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was , ” harpe said .
“ even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to ‘ sensitive ' websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them . "
these so-called “ sensitive ” sites which have been shut down include independent new services , blogs attempting to get uncensored news out of china , and international broadcasters which have been deemed dangerous by the chinese government , dw-world.de 's chinese page included .
situation not getting any better amnesty 's harpe believes that behind these claims of progress , the human rights situation has actually worsened , not in spite of the olympics but because of them .
“ in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues , ” she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese police lay low during the olympics ?
to obtain lasting human rights reforms , amnesty international says that governments and olympic committees should move away from the “ quiet diplomacy ” promoted by the ioc and publicly criticize china ; despite claims that to do business with china it has to happen behind closed doors .
“ it is unlikely that the change in the death sentence review would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though public pressure has worked , ” harpe said .
but with the ioc and world leaders like french president nicolas sarkozy unwilling , or unable , to confront china publicly , further improvements - however minor - seem unlikely as the games approach . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to the german olympic sports federation amid a growing debate on human rights as the beijing olympics loom . this weekend , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering called on athletes traveling to the beijing olympics to protest against human rights violations in tibet .
" each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
last week , under the slogan " we are all chinese , " nine german olympians posed in their sports kit for a munich magazine while holding pictures of chinese dissidents in front of their faces .
many of the national olympic committees -lrb- nocs -rrb- have been criticized by human rights groups for their stances on the situation in china and the regulations that some of them have applied to their athletes traveling to beijing as the debate over press freedom and human rights abuses intensifies in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing , dw-world.de spoke to michael schirp , head of the media department at the german olympic s ports federation ’ s -lrb- dosb -rrb- about what 's acceptable and what 's not .
dw-world.de : amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has called for the dosb to clarify its rules on political protests by athletes .
has the dosb taken any action on this or does it believe the rules are clear ?
michael schirp : dosb states that rules have been made clear by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- .
in germany , the dosb has explained the rules both in public and on the german team 's internal olympic web site . generally , athletes are free to say what they think , be it inside or outside of the olympic venues .
they may express their opinions in press conferences or even in the mixed zones , in our “ deutsches haus ” or anywhere else .
there is only one issue that is prohibited according to the ioc charter : the showing of signs , flags , bracelets , pins , banners with political , racial , ethnic , religious content or propaganda if shown inside of areas where an accreditation is needed such as the olympic venues .
apart from that , amnesty international and the dosb have worked together on the subject of human rights since may 2007 .
amnesty international has criticized the dosb for saying that the wearing of wristbands -lrb- ai 's “ gold for human rights ” or the german athletes ' “ sports for human rights ” bands -rrb- are forbidden as they are political statements .
does this ruling still stand ?
what is the dosb 's definition of a political statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german olympic team with president horst koehler i would point you to my first answer .
this is not limited to olympic games .
you 'll find this in any major sport event .
if every political , religious or ethnic conflict in the world would be carried into sporting events , the weight of such statements would be marginalized anyway .
but the most important thing is to keep these conflicts out of the event itself .
sport is intended to build bridges , not to further build walls .
it is only at the olympic games that 205 nocs and the countries they represent come together in a peaceful competition .
what are the dosb guidelines in terms of punishments for athletes who make political statements or protests in beijing ?
we do n't have any of those .
we are sure athletes are aware of their responsibility and have made up their minds regarding human rights in china .
they will find ways to express their opinion or , if they choose , not to , which also has to be respected as their free will .
before the chinese crackdown in tibet , neither the ioc nor dosb mentioned anything about china 's human rights record .
did the tibet situation force the olympic committees to accept that china had a human rights problem ?
to be perfectly blunt , this is just wrong .
before tibet , the media were not interested in sporting organizations which dealt with the issue .
it was in may 2007 , almost a year before the incidents in tibet , that the dosb published a declaration on human rights in china .
this was unique at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against china 's tibet policy marred the olympic torch relay in europe we clearly stated that we consider the situation to be unsatisfactory .
but we are a sport organization and can not solve the problems that the un and others could n't solve for 50 years .
sport is communication , not isolation .
we repeated this during easter 2008 and urged the parties in tibet to stop violence and bloodshed .
again , this was all published .
amnesty international has said that it has held meetings with the dosb to discuss human right .
what has been the outcome of the meetings with ai ?
this was just the start .
cooperation with ai , human rights watch and the human rights spokesperson of the german government continues .
all three of them have met with the team leaders in an attempt to pass on their information to the olympic team .

many of the national olympic committees -lrb- nocs -rrb- have been criticized by human rights groups for their stances on the situation in china and the regulations that some of them have applied to their athletes traveling to beijing as the debate over press freedom and human rights abuses intensifies in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing , dw-world.de spoke to michael schirp , head of the media department at the german olympic s ports federation ’ s -lrb- dosb -rrb- about what 's acceptable and what 's not .
dw-world.de : amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has called for the dosb to clarify its rules on political protests by athletes .
has the dosb taken any action on this or does it believe the rules are clear ?
michael schirp : dosb states that rules have been made clear by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- .
in germany , the dosb has explained the rules both in public and on the german team 's internal olympic web site . generally , athletes are free to say what they think , be it inside or outside of the olympic venues .
they may express their opinions in press conferences or even in the mixed zones , in our “ deutsches haus ” or anywhere else .
there is only one issue that is prohibited according to the ioc charter : the showing of signs , flags , bracelets , pins , banners with political , racial , ethnic , religious content or propaganda if shown inside of areas where an accreditation is needed such as the olympic venues .
apart from that , amnesty international and the dosb have worked together on the subject of human rights since may 2007 .
amnesty international has criticized the dosb for saying that the wearing of wristbands -lrb- ai 's “ gold for human rights ” or the german athletes ' “ sports for human rights ” bands -rrb- are forbidden as they are political statements .
does this ruling still stand ?
what is the dosb 's definition of a political statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german olympic team with president horst koehler i would point you to my first answer .
this is not limited to olympic games .
you 'll find this in any major sport event .
if every political , religious or ethnic conflict in the world would be carried into sporting events , the weight of such statements would be marginalized anyway .
but the most important thing is to keep these conflicts out of the event itself .
sport is intended to build bridges , not to further build walls .
it is only at the olympic games that 205 nocs and the countries they represent come together in a peaceful competition .
what are the dosb guidelines in terms of punishments for athletes who make political statements or protests in beijing ?
we do n't have any of those .
we are sure athletes are aware of their responsibility and have made up their minds regarding human rights in china .
they will find ways to express their opinion or , if they choose , not to , which also has to be respected as their free will .
before the chinese crackdown in tibet , neither the ioc nor dosb mentioned anything about china 's human rights record .
did the tibet situation force the olympic committees to accept that china had a human rights problem ?
to be perfectly blunt , this is just wrong .
before tibet , the media were not interested in sporting organizations which dealt with the issue .
it was in may 2007 , almost a year before the incidents in tibet , that the dosb published a declaration on human rights in china .
this was unique at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against china 's tibet policy marred the olympic torch relay in europe we clearly stated that we consider the situation to be unsatisfactory .
but we are a sport organization and can not solve the problems that the un and others could n't solve for 50 years .
sport is communication , not isolation .
we repeated this during easter 2008 and urged the parties in tibet to stop violence and bloodshed .

dw-world.de spoke to the german olympic sports federation amid a growing debate on human rights as the beijing olympics loom . this weekend , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering called on athletes traveling to the beijing olympics to protest against human rights violations in tibet .
" each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
last week , under the slogan " we are all chinese , " nine german olympians posed in their sports kit for a munich magazine while holding pictures of chinese dissidents in front of their faces .
many of the national olympic committees -lrb- nocs -rrb- have been criticized by human rights groups for their stances on the situation in china and the regulations that some of them have applied to their athletes traveling to beijing as the debate over press freedom and human rights abuses intensifies in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing , dw-world.de spoke to michael schirp , head of the media department at the german olympic s ports federation ’ s -lrb- dosb -rrb- about what 's acceptable and what 's not .
dw-world.de : amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has called for the dosb to clarify its rules on political protests by athletes .
has the dosb taken any action on this or does it believe the rules are clear ?
michael schirp : dosb states that rules have been made clear by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- .
in germany , the dosb has explained the rules both in public and on the german team 's internal olympic web site . generally , athletes are free to say what they think , be it inside or outside of the olympic venues .
they may express their opinions in press conferences or even in the mixed zones , in our “ deutsches haus ” or anywhere else .
there is only one issue that is prohibited according to the ioc charter : the showing of signs , flags , bracelets , pins , banners with political , racial , ethnic , religious content or propaganda if shown inside of areas where an accreditation is needed such as the olympic venues .
apart from that , amnesty international and the dosb have worked together on the subject of human rights since may 2007 .
amnesty international has criticized the dosb for saying that the wearing of wristbands -lrb- ai 's “ gold for human rights ” or the german athletes ' “ sports for human rights ” bands -rrb- are forbidden as they are political statements .
does this ruling still stand ?
what is the dosb 's definition of a political statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german olympic team with president horst koehler i would point you to my first answer .
this is not limited to olympic games .
you 'll find this in any major sport event .
if every political , religious or ethnic conflict in the world would be carried into sporting events , the weight of such statements would be marginalized anyway .
but the most important thing is to keep these conflicts out of the event itself .
sport is intended to build bridges , not to further build walls .
it is only at the olympic games that 205 nocs and the countries they represent come together in a peaceful competition .
what are the dosb guidelines in terms of punishments for athletes who make political statements or protests in beijing ?
we do n't have any of those .
we are sure athletes are aware of their responsibility and have made up their minds regarding human rights in china .
they will find ways to express their opinion or , if they choose , not to , which also has to be respected as their free will .
before the chinese crackdown in tibet , neither the ioc nor dosb mentioned anything about china 's human rights record .
did the tibet situation force the olympic committees to accept that china had a human rights problem ?
to be perfectly blunt , this is just wrong .
before tibet , the media were not interested in sporting organizations which dealt with the issue .
it was in may 2007 , almost a year before the incidents in tibet , that the dosb published a declaration on human rights in china .
this was unique at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against china 's tibet policy marred the olympic torch relay in europe we clearly stated that we consider the situation to be unsatisfactory .
but we are a sport organization and can not solve the problems that the un and others could n't solve for 50 years .
sport is communication , not isolation .
we repeated this during easter 2008 and urged the parties in tibet to stop violence and bloodshed .
again , this was all published .
amnesty international has said that it has held meetings with the dosb to discuss human right .
what has been the outcome of the meetings with ai ?
this was just the start .
cooperation with ai , human rights watch and the human rights spokesperson of the german government continues .
all three of them have met with the team leaders in an attempt to pass on their information to the olympic team .
the team 's internal web site provides all this information .
in addition , every german athlete who goes to beijing carries with him or her material from these human rights organizations and the un . nick amies interviewed michael schirp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .
on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .
they say that it is up to the ioc as the dosb does not have any leverage - since the dosb president thomas bach is also the vice-president of the ioc , we should see very soon whether they are really serious about this . nick amies interviewed verena harpe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views german foreign minister says olympics will " open up " china human rights -pipe- 04.08.2008 amnesty international : china has made only minor progress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international organized a large protest in berlin in december verena harpe , a china expert from amnesty international deutschland 's asia desk , spoke with dw-world.de about the current state of human rights in china and the efforts of the international community . dw-world.de : ever since the international pressure over human rights started to build , what efforts has china made to improve conditions ?
verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .
on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .
they say that it is up to the ioc as the dosb does not have any leverage - since the dosb president thomas bach is also the vice-president of the ioc , we should see very soon whether they are really serious about this . nick amies interviewed verena harpe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .
on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .

german politicians are calling for a comprehensive , nationwide law against smoking on the heels of the recent ruling by the german constitutional court to partially overturn bans in several german states . after years of dragging its feet on implementing a smoking ban , germany went smoke-free in bars and restaurants this year in a move that has both raised hackles and won praise .
so last wednesday 's court ruling , which found that individual state laws allowing bars to set up separate smoking and non-smoking areas gave large multi-room pubs an advantage over smaller one-room pubs , was one that was met with fierce debate . renate kuenast , the parliamentary co-leader of the opposition green party , criticized the federal government in comments on the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel on sunday .
" it was an act of cowardice to leave protection of non-smokers up to the states , " kuenast said . germans in favor of federal rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rule reversal now allows smoking in one-room pubs that 's a sentiment that many germans are echoing .
in a survey by the emnid institute that was published in the bild am sonntag newspaper sunday , some 81 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of the federal government setting rules on smoking in bars and restaurants instead of ceding responsibility to the states . even so , the bild survey showed a lack of agreement as to what those rules should be .
some 20 percent of respondents opposed a ban while 56 percent supported a smoking ban with exceptions – such as for small corner pubs .
just 23 percent wanted all bars and restaurants to be smoke-free . still , kuenast said that the green party would seek a nationwide ban on the basis of worker safety , which is regulated by the federal government . as the laws stand now , each state has been able to devise its own regulations against smoking .

roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , premier of the german state of hesse , said , however , that the states themselves could develop their own comprehensive smoking ban and he 's promised to put that issue on the agenda of the next meeting of state premiers in dresden in october .
" it is sensible for the states to reach as much of an amicable consensus on non-smoker protection as possible and to prevent a patchwork of regulations across the country , " koch said .
" we should also agree not to turn this into a political debate . " marlies volkmer , the social democratic spokeswoman for the german parliament 's committee for nutrition , agriculture and consumer protection , agreed . " the state parliaments are now called upon to use their discretion in order to impose a general smoking ban , " she said .
" only a consistent approach will truly serve health protection measures and would be completely clear for both pub owners and guests .

4 , to allow all under-23 players to participate at the olympics . the plea comes ahead of the men 's olympic football tournament , which starts aug .
7 , a day ahead of the official opening of the beijing olympics .
the tournament is open to players under the age of 23 , but three clubs have appealed to the court of arbitration for sport -lrb- cas -rrb- for the return of their players who are already in china . german clubs werder bremen and schalke 04 , as well as barcelona , have approached cas about their players diego , rafinha and lionel messi , respectively . blatter told a news conference at the beijing main press center that whatever the outcome before the world 's highest sports arbitration body , due in the next two days , fifa would tell the players to stay and play . " we are bound by the decisions of cas , but even if it is a decision that is negative for the players , i would say : let them play . " he also said that even with a cas rule in favor of the three clubs , the clubs should allow the players to stay . " the clubs should then say : we were right to appeal to cas , but in the spirit of the olympic games we will let them stay and play , " blatter said . finding a balance between clubs and national teams the soccer head said that he was surprised that these problems had arisen ahead of these games . " in 1988 the fifa congress made the decision that the olympic tournament should be open to players under 23 , " he said .
" since then , we have not had a single complaint or problem with the release of players . " also when the tournament was opened to include three over-aged players , it remained without problems , " blatter added . he said he thought this issue was part of the ongoing problem of trying to combine the interest of clubs with that of the national teams . " we have to find a balance , " he said . at the same time , blatter complimented the english premier league and the italian serie a for releasing all their players , irrespective of whether they were under-23 or not . " we need solidarity in soccer " he said .
" we need everybody to work together .
players should be given the opportunity of playing at the olympics . " he dismissed the argument put forward by some clubs saying that as the olympic tournament was not on the international match calendar , players need not be released for it . " the match calendar deals only with the senior national teams ; it does not mention youth tournament , " he said . revised rules for london ? he also said that the fifa congress in 2006 had decided that the format of the olympic tournament will stay the same for 2008 , but that the issue would be revisited after the beijing games for the 2012 olympics in london . " in england there will also be the issue of one british team instead of four associations which fifa recognizes , " said blatter , referring to fifa 's special dispensation which allows scotland , england , wales and northern ireland to field their own teams in other fifa competitions . " the olympic body will allow just one team , britain , " blatter said . the 72-year-old , who said that this tournament was a special one because it marked 100 years of olympic soccer , thanked the ioc for allowing 12 women teams and 16 men teams to participate . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we agreed that in the absence of a positive response , we have no choice but to pursue further measures , " gallegos said monday .
britain took the same line : " unless tomorrow 's answer is unambiguous and positive , we will have no choice but to proceed with further sanctions measures , " a foreign office spokesman told reuters news agency .
france also showed that it is unwilling to wait much longer .
" if we do n't get an encouraging response from the iranians , we will have to show firmness , resort to sanctions as in the past , " jean-pierre lacroix , france 's deputy ambassador to the un , told afp on monday .
iran takes different view bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has refused to stop its nuclear program iran is already living with three sets of sanctions imposed by the united nations .

a spokesman for solana confirmed to afp news agency that the phone call had taken place , but did not mention any promise by jalili to provide a written response by tuesday .
iranian media reported that in the telphone call " both sides agreed to continue talks . "

" companies ' expectations for the next six months are terribly bad , " carstensen said .
though order books are full right now , there are no new orders , carstensen warned .
" the upturn will definitely be over in winter .
many companies will gradually start cutting back on production and also lay off staff . "
the newspaper reported that german companies rated their order situation to be the worst in two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal industry is worried about getting new orders germany 's engineering and electronics employer group , gesamtmetall also voiced worries about the effects of a cooling global economy .
" the global economic slowdown is increasingly affecting the metal and electronics industry , " gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser told bild .
" in many companies , there 's enough work to last only until the end of the year . "
" heading towards zero " the news comes on the heels of top german carmakers showing signs of suffering from the global downturn .
last friday , bmw said it would miss its 2008 targets , following rival daimler with a profit warning as soaring oil and raw materials costs combined with a faltering us economy begin to bite the auto sector .
" the downturn will last longer and hit harder than companies have so far assumed , " deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter told newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag on the weekend .
" on the labor market , there will be bad news during the whole of 2009 . "
german joblessness fell by 20,000 on the month in july to 3.250 million .
however , economists say falling unemployment will soon be overtaken by developments in the broader economy and warn that the buoyancy of the labor market will not last .
buffeted by the global credit crisis , a weakening us economy and soaring prices for oil and raw materials , the clouds over the german economy have grown since the start of the year .
" the idea that we can continue to grow briskly with the few countries that are ticking along is unrealistic , in light of the numerous countries that are no longer ticking along , " walter told tagesspiegel am sonntag .
" for years we had double-digit growth rates in exports , now we are heading towards zero , " he added .
growth slower in euro zone than in the us analysts have already begun reversing downward their growth projections for europe 's largest economy .
the german finance ministry said last week that german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrank considerably in the second quarter after a strong start to the year , when europe 's largest economy expanded at its fastest rate since 1996 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retail sales in germany have fallen amid a downbeat mood among consumers german business daily handelsblatt said that based on a survey of 10 leading german and international banks and research institutes , big german companies will have to reckon with shrinking profits this year .
hopes that europe could isolate itself from the economic crisis in the us have evaporated , the paper said .
instead , current forecasts show that both economic growth and rise in profits in the euro zone in 2008 may be slower than in the us , the paper said .
the experts surveyed by the paper expect growth of just 0.9 percent in the euro zone for next year as against 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2.7 percent in 2007 .
in june , the european central bank had forecast a growth rate of 1.5 percent for the euro zone in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but can the military help cut crime ? the controversial deployment of nearly 3,000 troops throughout italy was introduced by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right government as a move that would help combat crime .
the government , which took office in april after berlusconi successfully campaigned on a law-and-order platform , has linked crime and illegal immigration and passed a series of measures aimed at cracking down on both .
to that end , the government began a six-month deployment of hundreds of troops who now join local police forces in urban centers like rome , naples , and milan , according to press reports from those cities .
another 1,000 of the troops went to embassies , railway stations , churches , and other sensitive places where tourists tend to congregate .
the soldiers there have been authorized to only make arrests when they catch people actually committing a crime .

but can the military help cut crime ? the controversial deployment of nearly 3,000 troops throughout italy was introduced by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right government as a move that would help combat crime .
the government , which took office in april after berlusconi successfully campaigned on a law-and-order platform , has linked crime and illegal immigration and passed a series of measures aimed at cracking down on both .
to that end , the government began a six-month deployment of hundreds of troops who now join local police forces in urban centers like rome , naples , and milan , according to press reports from those cities .
another 1,000 of the troops went to embassies , railway stations , churches , and other sensitive places where tourists tend to congregate .
the soldiers there have been authorized to only make arrests when they catch people actually committing a crime .
the remaining third have been sent to guard holding centers for illegal immigrants .
on the island of lampedusa , where thousands of migrants have arrived from africa in recent months seeking to enter europe , 70 air force troops were supplementing police who patrol the perimeter of a reception center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops were likewise deployed to the immigrant holding center at lampedusa claims of increased security have opposition crying foul interior minister roberto maroni of the anti-immigrant northern league said he wants to " give the public a better perception of security . "
opposition leaders have criticized the move , however , labeling it as " propaganda " and questioning its effectiveness in combating crime .
they have argued instead that more funds and other resources should have been provided to the police .
a union representing the police , coisp , also slammed the decision , and in a statement welcomed the fact that no soldiers are to be deployed in venice .
" we 're off the hook -lrb- in venice -rrb- because for every three soldiers deployed , one police or carabinieri -lrb- paramilitary police -rrb- needs to be provided as backup , " coisp said in a statement .
" where are we going to find extra police ? "
coisp asked , lamenting what it said was a scarcity of fuel for police squad cars and a lack of overtime pay for police officers .
rome rejects " militarization " of its city center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's mayor wo n't allow troops in the city 's historic district rome 's mayor , gianni alemanno likewise hit back , refusing to allow the troops to patrol the historic city center , where the majority of tourists spend their time .
he said he feared that the " militarization " of the capital would scare away visitors .
officials , however , downplayed the decision to draft in troops .
" in 1992 , 20,000 men were sent to sicily alone " to aid police in fighting the mafia after the murder of two judges , deputy chief of the general staff general mario buscemi was quoted by daily la repubblica as saying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views german foreign minister says olympics will " open up " china human rights -pipe- 04.08.2008 amnesty international : china has made only minor progress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international organized a large protest in berlin in december verena harpe , a china expert from amnesty international deutschland 's asia desk , spoke with dw-world.de about the current state of human rights in china and the efforts of the international community . dw-world.de : ever since the international pressure over human rights started to build , what efforts has china made to improve conditions ?
verena harpe : unfortunately there have only been minor improvements .
in 2007 , china reintroduced the supreme people 's court death penalty review which means that every death sentence must be heard by the top court .
before that , the local courts would just decide .
but as there were many miscarriages of justice , and the fact that so many death sentences - more than in any other country in the world - were being handed down , international pressure eventually brought about this change .
it is unlikely that this change would have come about if the subject had n't been addressed by the un and others , so in this case it looks as though pressure has worked .
the chinese say it has reduced the number of death sentences by 15 percent but no-one knows for sure if this is correct because the figures are covered by state secrecy laws .
however , in china , there are still around 70 crimes which carry the death sentence , also many non-violent crimes such as economic and drug-related offences .
this is a first step but more needs to be done .
in particular , it still does not guarantee that those facing the death penalty in china receive a fair trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai wants clarification over the rights of athletes to engage in political protests another improvement , as claimed by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , is the increased freedom of movement for foreign journalists .
they can travel around the provinces without having to apply for special permission or arrange interviews through the authorities .
now this sounds good but the reality , what we 've heard , is a very different story .
first , it is likely that this will only last until after the paralympics in october and then it will probably change back .
secondly , correspondents have been complaining about harassment , arrests , restrictions of movement and detention without charge for pursuing stories on sensitive issues .
while the claim that journalists can travel where they like and talk to who they like sounds good and is celebrated by the ioc , this is not being implemented .
also , the people that journalists want to talk to are usually the most interesting in terms of the situation in china .
these people are being intimidated by the authorities and even detained .
for example , a man who had his house and business demolished in 2003 to make way for some olympic construction was jailed for four years for protesting against forced evictions .
he was due to be released in july but the authorities have put his release date back to october – after the games .
this is because foreign journalists would want to talk to him .
this kind of intimidation and harassment , as well as house arrests and the detention of undesirables have been especially severe in the olympic neighborhoods .
what new restrictions and measures have the chinese brought in ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international has turned up its criticism of china in some respects the human rights situation has actually worsened and this is not in spite but because of the olympics .
in the run-up to the olympics the crackdown on human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists has intensified , the authorities have stepped up repression against critical voices speaking out about the games and other sensitive issues .
there have been more cases of prison sentences being handed out for protesting against the games , activists have been harassed , kidnapped or put under house arrest .
this has been getting worse as the games approach .
there has also been an increase in so-called administrative detentions , which are decided without a trial , without facing a court and which can lead to up to four years of “ re-education through labor ” .
this has been used to clean up the beggars , petitioners and illegal taxi drivers in beijing .
has amnesty been encouraged by the response of the international community ?
is enough being done ?
there has definitely been more discussion since the events in tibet which really opened up the subject of china 's human rights abuses .
until the tibet unrest occurred , the ioc had never mentioned anything of arrests of human right defenders or the imprisonment of dissidents .
tibet forced the issue into the open .
after that , governments and the ioc could n't really stay quiet .
but ioc president jacques rogge only once said something critical with regard to tibet .
apart from this the ioc has always pointed out that the games are a “ force for good ” and claimed that there was progress on human rights because of the olympics .
not once have they commented on the crackdown on critical voices or other violations with a direct link to the games .
the ioc 's approach of silent diplomacy apparently has not yielded significant results .
for instance , not long ago , the ioc stated that there was no censorship of the internet in china when there most clearly was .
even foreign journalists in the olympic press centers have no access to “ sensitive ” websites , although the chinese authorities had promised full media freedom for them .
now the ioc is forced to backtrack , but it said that it was mainly sites unrelated to the olympics that were shut down and that olympic-related sites were running – this is unacceptable .
it seems that when there is something positive to report , the praise is glowing .
but when there is criticism to be voiced , there is very little said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests over the situation in tibet accompanied the olympic torch parades international pressure from other governments for human rights reform has also been insufficient .
they have taken up the issue with the chinese behind closed doors in private discussions .
amnesty international is not against this but private discussion is not enough .
these talks should be combined with public pressure , something the ioc and international governments are loath to do .
they say that public pressure is not the way of dealing with china but the change in approach to the death sentence shows that china does react to public pressure .
what we would expect is more open and frank public discussion of the human rights situation , otherwise governments are sending the message that it is acceptable to host the olympics in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution ..
as for the boycotting of the opening ceremony by some head of states and governments , amnesty international has never called for a boycott of the games or for anyone not to go .
we want them to go - as long as they go and then speak out .
they must publicly condemn human rights violations .
if they do n't speak out , this would effectively be a conspiracy of silence and it would undermine the principles and spirit of the olympic charter .
how satisfied is amnesty international deutschland with germany 's approach to the human rights issue and the olympic games , from the perspective of the government and the dosb ?
again , the tibet issue provoked some public condemnation but as with most governments the main discussions went on behind closed doors .
the german government claims that improvements can be achieved through the bilateral human rights dialogue it has set up with china and the rule of law dialogue , but these have yet to really reach any level of sensitivity despite going on for a long time .
so far the rule of law dialogue has focused on trade law rather than legislation which would help improve the human rights situation .
as for the human rights dialogue , there have been some positive noises but no concrete results or even benchmarks set . while amnesty is not opposed to dialogue , we believe it has to be complemented by public pressure as it is a key factor that could still help secure change .
as for the dosb , our main criticism at the moment is the clarification of the ioc guidelines on political protests .
the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
the dosb 's guidelines for athletes are ambiguous ; they just said that decisions on action will be decided in response to individual cases .
what they have said that the wearing of wristbands is prohibited .
-lrb- amnesty has its own “ gold for human rights ” band while german athletes have produced their own “ sport for human rights ” version -rrb- .
we argue that this is not a political statement , human rights are not political .
on the contrary , they are in line with the olympic values enshrined in the charter .
on the other hand , we appreciate that the dosb has just asked the ioc to put pressure on the chinese to lift internet censorship in the olympics press centers .
they say that it is up to the ioc as the dosb does not have any leverage - since the dosb president thomas bach is also the vice-president of the ioc , we should see very soon whether they are really serious about this . nick amies interviewed verena harpe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to the german olympic sports federation amid a growing debate on human rights as the beijing olympics loom . this weekend , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering called on athletes traveling to the beijing olympics to protest against human rights violations in tibet .
" each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
last week , under the slogan " we are all chinese , " nine german olympians posed in their sports kit for a munich magazine while holding pictures of chinese dissidents in front of their faces .
many of the national olympic committees -lrb- nocs -rrb- have been criticized by human rights groups for their stances on the situation in china and the regulations that some of them have applied to their athletes traveling to beijing as the debate over press freedom and human rights abuses intensifies in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing , dw-world.de spoke to michael schirp , head of the media department at the german olympic s ports federation ’ s -lrb- dosb -rrb- about what 's acceptable and what 's not .
dw-world.de : amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- has called for the dosb to clarify its rules on political protests by athletes .
has the dosb taken any action on this or does it believe the rules are clear ?
michael schirp : dosb states that rules have been made clear by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- .
in germany , the dosb has explained the rules both in public and on the german team 's internal olympic web site . generally , athletes are free to say what they think , be it inside or outside of the olympic venues .
they may express their opinions in press conferences or even in the mixed zones , in our “ deutsches haus ” or anywhere else .
there is only one issue that is prohibited according to the ioc charter : the showing of signs , flags , bracelets , pins , banners with political , racial , ethnic , religious content or propaganda if shown inside of areas where an accreditation is needed such as the olympic venues .
apart from that , amnesty international and the dosb have worked together on the subject of human rights since may 2007 .
amnesty international has criticized the dosb for saying that the wearing of wristbands -lrb- ai 's “ gold for human rights ” or the german athletes ' “ sports for human rights ” bands -rrb- are forbidden as they are political statements .
does this ruling still stand ?
what is the dosb 's definition of a political statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german olympic team with president horst koehler i would point you to my first answer .
this is not limited to olympic games .
you 'll find this in any major sport event .
if every political , religious or ethnic conflict in the world would be carried into sporting events , the weight of such statements would be marginalized anyway .
but the most important thing is to keep these conflicts out of the event itself .
sport is intended to build bridges , not to further build walls .
it is only at the olympic games that 205 nocs and the countries they represent come together in a peaceful competition .
what are the dosb guidelines in terms of punishments for athletes who make political statements or protests in beijing ?
we do n't have any of those .
we are sure athletes are aware of their responsibility and have made up their minds regarding human rights in china .
they will find ways to express their opinion or , if they choose , not to , which also has to be respected as their free will .
before the chinese crackdown in tibet , neither the ioc nor dosb mentioned anything about china 's human rights record .
did the tibet situation force the olympic committees to accept that china had a human rights problem ?
to be perfectly blunt , this is just wrong .
before tibet , the media were not interested in sporting organizations which dealt with the issue .
it was in may 2007 , almost a year before the incidents in tibet , that the dosb published a declaration on human rights in china .
this was unique at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against china 's tibet policy marred the olympic torch relay in europe we clearly stated that we consider the situation to be unsatisfactory .
but we are a sport organization and can not solve the problems that the un and others could n't solve for 50 years .
sport is communication , not isolation .
we repeated this during easter 2008 and urged the parties in tibet to stop violence and bloodshed .
again , this was all published .
amnesty international has said that it has held meetings with the dosb to discuss human right .
what has been the outcome of the meetings with ai ?
this was just the start .
cooperation with ai , human rights watch and the human rights spokesperson of the german government continues .
all three of them have met with the team leaders in an attempt to pass on their information to the olympic team .
the team 's internal web site provides all this information .
in addition , every german athlete who goes to beijing carries with him or her material from these human rights organizations and the un . nick amies interviewed michael schirp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview published monday , germany 's intelligence chief said that osama bin laden , the " che guevara of al qaeda , " no longer personally plans attacks . ernst uhrlau , the head of germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , spoke with bild newspaper reporter monday about terrorism and the bnd 's efforts to combat it .
in the interview , which includes a brief discussion on the recent bombing in istanbul , uhrlau was quoted as saying that he knew that " islamist terrorist " forces were at work in turkey as part of a global jihad movement . those forces , he claimed , were just a part of the al qaeda terrorist network .
al qaeda , he said , is still being run by osama bin laden , who " as far as we know " still resides in the afghan-pakistani border region .
uhrlau , however , no longer sees bin laden as personally planning attacks . instead , uhrlau said , he is " a creative director and icon , something like the che guevara of al qaeda " who helps hold the terror network together . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians are calling for a comprehensive , nationwide law against smoking on the heels of the recent ruling by the german constitutional court to partially overturn bans in several german states . after years of dragging its feet on implementing a smoking ban , germany went smoke-free in bars and restaurants this year in a move that has both raised hackles and won praise .
so last wednesday 's court ruling , which found that individual state laws allowing bars to set up separate smoking and non-smoking areas gave large multi-room pubs an advantage over smaller one-room pubs , was one that was met with fierce debate . renate kuenast , the parliamentary co-leader of the opposition green party , criticized the federal government in comments on the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel on sunday .
" it was an act of cowardice to leave protection of non-smokers up to the states , " kuenast said . germans in favor of federal rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rule reversal now allows smoking in one-room pubs that 's a sentiment that many germans are echoing .
in a survey by the emnid institute that was published in the bild am sonntag newspaper sunday , some 81 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of the federal government setting rules on smoking in bars and restaurants instead of ceding responsibility to the states . even so , the bild survey showed a lack of agreement as to what those rules should be .
some 20 percent of respondents opposed a ban while 56 percent supported a smoking ban with exceptions – such as for small corner pubs .
just 23 percent wanted all bars and restaurants to be smoke-free . still , kuenast said that the green party would seek a nationwide ban on the basis of worker safety , which is regulated by the federal government . as the laws stand now , each state has been able to devise its own regulations against smoking .
in bavaria , that means smokers get a reprieve during the state 's annual oktoberfest , when the beer tents synonymous with the festival become smoking zones . calls for consistency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer tents at oktoberfest : still a smoking zone .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , premier of the german state of hesse , said , however , that the states themselves could develop their own comprehensive smoking ban and he 's promised to put that issue on the agenda of the next meeting of state premiers in dresden in october .
" it is sensible for the states to reach as much of an amicable consensus on non-smoker protection as possible and to prevent a patchwork of regulations across the country , " koch said .
" we should also agree not to turn this into a political debate . " marlies volkmer , the social democratic spokeswoman for the german parliament 's committee for nutrition , agriculture and consumer protection , agreed . " the state parliaments are now called upon to use their discretion in order to impose a general smoking ban , " she said .
" only a consistent approach will truly serve health protection measures and would be completely clear for both pub owners and guests .
we must get rid of germany 's patchwork of different rules regarding smoking . " dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
unless iran responds " unambigiously and positively " to the latest incentive package by tuesday , aug 5 , the country will face sanctions , several countries warned on monday .

diplomats from the group of six agreed to push for new action against iran if the country continues to stall , according to us state department spokesman gonzago gallegos .
" we agreed that in the absence of a positive response , we have no choice but to pursue further measures , " gallegos said monday .
britain took the same line : " unless tomorrow 's answer is unambiguous and positive , we will have no choice but to proceed with further sanctions measures , " a foreign office spokesman told reuters news agency .
france also showed that it is unwilling to wait much longer .
" if we do n't get an encouraging response from the iranians , we will have to show firmness , resort to sanctions as in the past , " jean-pierre lacroix , france 's deputy ambassador to the un , told afp on monday .

“ many companies still see job training as a cost factor and not as an investment , ” dgb vice president ingrid sehrbrock told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" unacceptable " situation germany trails the field in international comparisons of job training , sehrbrock said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions advocate trading overtime for training " it is still the case that those who are already well qualified are the ones who get offered the training opportunities first , ” sehrbrock said .
and people over age 45 are encouraged less than the younger workers are , she added .
giving the country 's aging demographics , this situation is “ unacceptable , ” sehrbrock said .
meanwhile a dgb poll showed that job training is an important topic , with 70 percent of respondents saying that lifelong learning is important to them .
some 68 percent of workers complained their companies offered them few , if any , training opportunities .
and 55 percent said further education does not play an important role for their superiors .
plan promotes " learning accounts " in response , the dgb is calling for a “ second chance for adults ” program that would include increased federal loans for workers interested in further job training .
specifically , the dgb is promoting the idea of “ learning accounts , ” where workers can bank vacation days or overtime toward paying for further qualifications .
sehrbrock hopes the government would grant small and mid-size companies financial aid and advice in support of the measures . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the interview , which includes a brief discussion on the recent bombing in istanbul , uhrlau was quoted as saying that he knew that " islamist terrorist " forces were at work in turkey as part of a global jihad movement . those forces , he claimed , were just a part of the al qaeda terrorist network .
al qaeda , he said , is still being run by osama bin laden , who " as far as we know " still resides in the afghan-pakistani border region .
uhrlau , however , no longer sees bin laden as personally planning attacks . instead , uhrlau said , he is " a creative director and icon , something like the che guevara of al qaeda " who helps hold the terror network together . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians are calling for a comprehensive , nationwide law against smoking on the heels of the recent ruling by the german constitutional court to partially overturn bans in several german states . after years of dragging its feet on implementing a smoking ban , germany went smoke-free in bars and restaurants this year in a move that has both raised hackles and won praise .
so last wednesday 's court ruling , which found that individual state laws allowing bars to set up separate smoking and non-smoking areas gave large multi-room pubs an advantage over smaller one-room pubs , was one that was met with fierce debate . renate kuenast , the parliamentary co-leader of the opposition green party , criticized the federal government in comments on the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel on sunday .

some 20 percent of respondents opposed a ban while 56 percent supported a smoking ban with exceptions – such as for small corner pubs .
just 23 percent wanted all bars and restaurants to be smoke-free . still , kuenast said that the green party would seek a nationwide ban on the basis of worker safety , which is regulated by the federal government . as the laws stand now , each state has been able to devise its own regulations against smoking .

in a survey by the emnid institute that was published in the bild am sonntag newspaper sunday , some 81 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of the federal government setting rules on smoking in bars and restaurants instead of ceding responsibility to the states . even so , the bild survey showed a lack of agreement as to what those rules should be .
some 20 percent of respondents opposed a ban while 56 percent supported a smoking ban with exceptions – such as for small corner pubs .
just 23 percent wanted all bars and restaurants to be smoke-free . still , kuenast said that the green party would seek a nationwide ban on the basis of worker safety , which is regulated by the federal government . as the laws stand now , each state has been able to devise its own regulations against smoking .
in bavaria , that means smokers get a reprieve during the state 's annual oktoberfest , when the beer tents synonymous with the festival become smoking zones . calls for consistency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer tents at oktoberfest : still a smoking zone .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , premier of the german state of hesse , said , however , that the states themselves could develop their own comprehensive smoking ban and he 's promised to put that issue on the agenda of the next meeting of state premiers in dresden in october .
" it is sensible for the states to reach as much of an amicable consensus on non-smoker protection as possible and to prevent a patchwork of regulations across the country , " koch said .
" we should also agree not to turn this into a political debate . " marlies volkmer , the social democratic spokeswoman for the german parliament 's committee for nutrition , agriculture and consumer protection , agreed . " the state parliaments are now called upon to use their discretion in order to impose a general smoking ban , " she said .
" only a consistent approach will truly serve health protection measures and would be completely clear for both pub owners and guests .
we must get rid of germany 's patchwork of different rules regarding smoking . " dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 , to allow all under-23 players to participate at the olympics . the plea comes ahead of the men 's olympic football tournament , which starts aug .
7 , a day ahead of the official opening of the beijing olympics .
the tournament is open to players under the age of 23 , but three clubs have appealed to the court of arbitration for sport -lrb- cas -rrb- for the return of their players who are already in china . german clubs werder bremen and schalke 04 , as well as barcelona , have approached cas about their players diego , rafinha and lionel messi , respectively . blatter told a news conference at the beijing main press center that whatever the outcome before the world 's highest sports arbitration body , due in the next two days , fifa would tell the players to stay and play . " we are bound by the decisions of cas , but even if it is a decision that is negative for the players , i would say : let them play . " he also said that even with a cas rule in favor of the three clubs , the clubs should allow the players to stay . " the clubs should then say : we were right to appeal to cas , but in the spirit of the olympic games we will let them stay and play , " blatter said . finding a balance between clubs and national teams the soccer head said that he was surprised that these problems had arisen ahead of these games . " in 1988 the fifa congress made the decision that the olympic tournament should be open to players under 23 , " he said .
" since then , we have not had a single complaint or problem with the release of players . " also when the tournament was opened to include three over-aged players , it remained without problems , " blatter added . he said he thought this issue was part of the ongoing problem of trying to combine the interest of clubs with that of the national teams . " we have to find a balance , " he said . at the same time , blatter complimented the english premier league and the italian serie a for releasing all their players , irrespective of whether they were under-23 or not . " we need solidarity in soccer " he said .
" we need everybody to work together .
players should be given the opportunity of playing at the olympics . " he dismissed the argument put forward by some clubs saying that as the olympic tournament was not on the international match calendar , players need not be released for it . " the match calendar deals only with the senior national teams ; it does not mention youth tournament , " he said . revised rules for london ? he also said that the fifa congress in 2006 had decided that the format of the olympic tournament will stay the same for 2008 , but that the issue would be revisited after the beijing games for the 2012 olympics in london . " in england there will also be the issue of one british team instead of four associations which fifa recognizes , " said blatter , referring to fifa 's special dispensation which allows scotland , england , wales and northern ireland to field their own teams in other fifa competitions . " the olympic body will allow just one team , britain , " blatter said . the 72-year-old , who said that this tournament was a special one because it marked 100 years of olympic soccer , thanked the ioc for allowing 12 women teams and 16 men teams to participate . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ many companies still see job training as a cost factor and not as an investment , ” dgb vice president ingrid sehrbrock told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" unacceptable " situation germany trails the field in international comparisons of job training , sehrbrock said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions advocate trading overtime for training " it is still the case that those who are already well qualified are the ones who get offered the training opportunities first , ” sehrbrock said .
and people over age 45 are encouraged less than the younger workers are , she added .
giving the country 's aging demographics , this situation is “ unacceptable , ” sehrbrock said .
meanwhile a dgb poll showed that job training is an important topic , with 70 percent of respondents saying that lifelong learning is important to them .
some 68 percent of workers complained their companies offered them few , if any , training opportunities .
and 55 percent said further education does not play an important role for their superiors .
plan promotes " learning accounts " in response , the dgb is calling for a “ second chance for adults ” program that would include increased federal loans for workers interested in further job training .
specifically , the dgb is promoting the idea of “ learning accounts , ” where workers can bank vacation days or overtime toward paying for further qualifications .

" companies ' expectations for the next six months are terribly bad , " carstensen said .
though order books are full right now , there are no new orders , carstensen warned .
" the upturn will definitely be over in winter .
many companies will gradually start cutting back on production and also lay off staff . "
the newspaper reported that german companies rated their order situation to be the worst in two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal industry is worried about getting new orders germany 's engineering and electronics employer group , gesamtmetall also voiced worries about the effects of a cooling global economy .
" the global economic slowdown is increasingly affecting the metal and electronics industry , " gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser told bild .
" in many companies , there 's enough work to last only until the end of the year . "
" heading towards zero " the news comes on the heels of top german carmakers showing signs of suffering from the global downturn .
last friday , bmw said it would miss its 2008 targets , following rival daimler with a profit warning as soaring oil and raw materials costs combined with a faltering us economy begin to bite the auto sector .
" the downturn will last longer and hit harder than companies have so far assumed , " deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter told newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag on the weekend .
" on the labor market , there will be bad news during the whole of 2009 . "
german joblessness fell by 20,000 on the month in july to 3.250 million .
however , economists say falling unemployment will soon be overtaken by developments in the broader economy and warn that the buoyancy of the labor market will not last .
buffeted by the global credit crisis , a weakening us economy and soaring prices for oil and raw materials , the clouds over the german economy have grown since the start of the year .
" the idea that we can continue to grow briskly with the few countries that are ticking along is unrealistic , in light of the numerous countries that are no longer ticking along , " walter told tagesspiegel am sonntag .
" for years we had double-digit growth rates in exports , now we are heading towards zero , " he added .
growth slower in euro zone than in the us analysts have already begun reversing downward their growth projections for europe 's largest economy .
the german finance ministry said last week that german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrank considerably in the second quarter after a strong start to the year , when europe 's largest economy expanded at its fastest rate since 1996 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retail sales in germany have fallen amid a downbeat mood among consumers german business daily handelsblatt said that based on a survey of 10 leading german and international banks and research institutes , big german companies will have to reckon with shrinking profits this year .
hopes that europe could isolate itself from the economic crisis in the us have evaporated , the paper said .
instead , current forecasts show that both economic growth and rise in profits in the euro zone in 2008 may be slower than in the us , the paper said .
the experts surveyed by the paper expect growth of just 0.9 percent in the euro zone for next year as against 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2.7 percent in 2007 .
in june , the european central bank had forecast a growth rate of 1.5 percent for the euro zone in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians are calling for a comprehensive , nationwide law against smoking on the heels of the recent ruling by the german constitutional court to partially overturn bans in several german states . after years of dragging its feet on implementing a smoking ban , germany went smoke-free in bars and restaurants this year in a move that has both raised hackles and won praise .
so last wednesday 's court ruling , which found that individual state laws allowing bars to set up separate smoking and non-smoking areas gave large multi-room pubs an advantage over smaller one-room pubs , was one that was met with fierce debate . renate kuenast , the parliamentary co-leader of the opposition green party , criticized the federal government in comments on the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel on sunday .
" it was an act of cowardice to leave protection of non-smokers up to the states , " kuenast said . germans in favor of federal rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rule reversal now allows smoking in one-room pubs that 's a sentiment that many germans are echoing .
in a survey by the emnid institute that was published in the bild am sonntag newspaper sunday , some 81 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of the federal government setting rules on smoking in bars and restaurants instead of ceding responsibility to the states . even so , the bild survey showed a lack of agreement as to what those rules should be .
some 20 percent of respondents opposed a ban while 56 percent supported a smoking ban with exceptions – such as for small corner pubs .
just 23 percent wanted all bars and restaurants to be smoke-free . still , kuenast said that the green party would seek a nationwide ban on the basis of worker safety , which is regulated by the federal government . as the laws stand now , each state has been able to devise its own regulations against smoking .
in bavaria , that means smokers get a reprieve during the state 's annual oktoberfest , when the beer tents synonymous with the festival become smoking zones . calls for consistency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer tents at oktoberfest : still a smoking zone .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , premier of the german state of hesse , said , however , that the states themselves could develop their own comprehensive smoking ban and he 's promised to put that issue on the agenda of the next meeting of state premiers in dresden in october .
" it is sensible for the states to reach as much of an amicable consensus on non-smoker protection as possible and to prevent a patchwork of regulations across the country , " koch said .
" we should also agree not to turn this into a political debate . " marlies volkmer , the social democratic spokeswoman for the german parliament 's committee for nutrition , agriculture and consumer protection , agreed . " the state parliaments are now called upon to use their discretion in order to impose a general smoking ban , " she said .

" companies ' expectations for the next six months are terribly bad , " carstensen said .
though order books are full right now , there are no new orders , carstensen warned .
" the upturn will definitely be over in winter .
many companies will gradually start cutting back on production and also lay off staff . "
the newspaper reported that german companies rated their order situation to be the worst in two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal industry is worried about getting new orders germany 's engineering and electronics employer group , gesamtmetall also voiced worries about the effects of a cooling global economy .
" the global economic slowdown is increasingly affecting the metal and electronics industry , " gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser told bild .
" in many companies , there 's enough work to last only until the end of the year . "
" heading towards zero " the news comes on the heels of top german carmakers showing signs of suffering from the global downturn .
last friday , bmw said it would miss its 2008 targets , following rival daimler with a profit warning as soaring oil and raw materials costs combined with a faltering us economy begin to bite the auto sector .
" the downturn will last longer and hit harder than companies have so far assumed , " deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter told newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag on the weekend .
" on the labor market , there will be bad news during the whole of 2009 . "
german joblessness fell by 20,000 on the month in july to 3.250 million .
however , economists say falling unemployment will soon be overtaken by developments in the broader economy and warn that the buoyancy of the labor market will not last .
buffeted by the global credit crisis , a weakening us economy and soaring prices for oil and raw materials , the clouds over the german economy have grown since the start of the year .
" the idea that we can continue to grow briskly with the few countries that are ticking along is unrealistic , in light of the numerous countries that are no longer ticking along , " walter told tagesspiegel am sonntag .
" for years we had double-digit growth rates in exports , now we are heading towards zero , " he added .
growth slower in euro zone than in the us analysts have already begun reversing downward their growth projections for europe 's largest economy .
the german finance ministry said last week that german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrank considerably in the second quarter after a strong start to the year , when europe 's largest economy expanded at its fastest rate since 1996 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retail sales in germany have fallen amid a downbeat mood among consumers german business daily handelsblatt said that based on a survey of 10 leading german and international banks and research institutes , big german companies will have to reckon with shrinking profits this year .
hopes that europe could isolate itself from the economic crisis in the us have evaporated , the paper said .
instead , current forecasts show that both economic growth and rise in profits in the euro zone in 2008 may be slower than in the us , the paper said .
the experts surveyed by the paper expect growth of just 0.9 percent in the euro zone for next year as against 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2.7 percent in 2007 .
in june , the european central bank had forecast a growth rate of 1.5 percent for the euro zone in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" companies ' expectations for the next six months are terribly bad , " carstensen said .
though order books are full right now , there are no new orders , carstensen warned .
" the upturn will definitely be over in winter .
many companies will gradually start cutting back on production and also lay off staff . "
the newspaper reported that german companies rated their order situation to be the worst in two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal industry is worried about getting new orders germany 's engineering and electronics employer group , gesamtmetall also voiced worries about the effects of a cooling global economy .
" the global economic slowdown is increasingly affecting the metal and electronics industry , " gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser told bild .
" in many companies , there 's enough work to last only until the end of the year . "
" heading towards zero " the news comes on the heels of top german carmakers showing signs of suffering from the global downturn .
last friday , bmw said it would miss its 2008 targets , following rival daimler with a profit warning as soaring oil and raw materials costs combined with a faltering us economy begin to bite the auto sector .
" the downturn will last longer and hit harder than companies have so far assumed , " deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter told newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag on the weekend .
" on the labor market , there will be bad news during the whole of 2009 . "
german joblessness fell by 20,000 on the month in july to 3.250 million .
however , economists say falling unemployment will soon be overtaken by developments in the broader economy and warn that the buoyancy of the labor market will not last .
buffeted by the global credit crisis , a weakening us economy and soaring prices for oil and raw materials , the clouds over the german economy have grown since the start of the year .
" the idea that we can continue to grow briskly with the few countries that are ticking along is unrealistic , in light of the numerous countries that are no longer ticking along , " walter told tagesspiegel am sonntag .
" for years we had double-digit growth rates in exports , now we are heading towards zero , " he added .
growth slower in euro zone than in the us analysts have already begun reversing downward their growth projections for europe 's largest economy .
the german finance ministry said last week that german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrank considerably in the second quarter after a strong start to the year , when europe 's largest economy expanded at its fastest rate since 1996 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retail sales in germany have fallen amid a downbeat mood among consumers german business daily handelsblatt said that based on a survey of 10 leading german and international banks and research institutes , big german companies will have to reckon with shrinking profits this year .
hopes that europe could isolate itself from the economic crisis in the us have evaporated , the paper said .
instead , current forecasts show that both economic growth and rise in profits in the euro zone in 2008 may be slower than in the us , the paper said .
the experts surveyed by the paper expect growth of just 0.9 percent in the euro zone for next year as against 1.5 percent in 2008 and 2.7 percent in 2007 .
in june , the european central bank had forecast a growth rate of 1.5 percent for the euro zone in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
unless iran responds " unambigiously and positively " to the latest incentive package by tuesday , aug 5 , the country will face sanctions , several countries warned on monday .
iran was offered a set of trade and economic incentives in mid-july which were aimed at convincing the country to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
but iran missed an informal saturday deadline to respond to the incentives package .
patience nearly worn out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atom symbol over iran flag jalili reportedly promised that tehran would provide a written response on tuesday to the incentives package , according to the us state department .
besides the us , the five other countries involved in negotiations with iran are britain , france , germany , russia and china .
diplomats from the group of six agreed to push for new action against iran if the country continues to stall , according to us state department spokesman gonzago gallegos .
" we agreed that in the absence of a positive response , we have no choice but to pursue further measures , " gallegos said monday .
britain took the same line : " unless tomorrow 's answer is unambiguous and positive , we will have no choice but to proceed with further sanctions measures , " a foreign office spokesman told reuters news agency .
france also showed that it is unwilling to wait much longer .
" if we do n't get an encouraging response from the iranians , we will have to show firmness , resort to sanctions as in the past , " jean-pierre lacroix , france 's deputy ambassador to the un , told afp on monday .
iran takes different view bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has refused to stop its nuclear program iran is already living with three sets of sanctions imposed by the united nations .
tehran has consistently refused to suspend its nuclear activities , which it claims will be used for energy production .
europe and other countries worry that iran wants to develop nuclear weapons .
a spokesman for solana confirmed to afp news agency that the phone call had taken place , but did not mention any promise by jalili to provide a written response by tuesday .
iranian media reported that in the telphone call " both sides agreed to continue talks . "
" they also emphasized that preserving this path -lrb- talks -rrb- needs a positive and constructive atmosphere , " the television report said , according to afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians are calling for a comprehensive , nationwide law against smoking on the heels of the recent ruling by the german constitutional court to partially overturn bans in several german states . after years of dragging its feet on implementing a smoking ban , germany went smoke-free in bars and restaurants this year in a move that has both raised hackles and won praise .
so last wednesday 's court ruling , which found that individual state laws allowing bars to set up separate smoking and non-smoking areas gave large multi-room pubs an advantage over smaller one-room pubs , was one that was met with fierce debate . renate kuenast , the parliamentary co-leader of the opposition green party , criticized the federal government in comments on the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel on sunday .
" it was an act of cowardice to leave protection of non-smokers up to the states , " kuenast said . germans in favor of federal rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rule reversal now allows smoking in one-room pubs that 's a sentiment that many germans are echoing .
in a survey by the emnid institute that was published in the bild am sonntag newspaper sunday , some 81 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of the federal government setting rules on smoking in bars and restaurants instead of ceding responsibility to the states . even so , the bild survey showed a lack of agreement as to what those rules should be .
some 20 percent of respondents opposed a ban while 56 percent supported a smoking ban with exceptions – such as for small corner pubs .
just 23 percent wanted all bars and restaurants to be smoke-free . still , kuenast said that the green party would seek a nationwide ban on the basis of worker safety , which is regulated by the federal government . as the laws stand now , each state has been able to devise its own regulations against smoking .
in bavaria , that means smokers get a reprieve during the state 's annual oktoberfest , when the beer tents synonymous with the festival become smoking zones . calls for consistency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer tents at oktoberfest : still a smoking zone .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , premier of the german state of hesse , said , however , that the states themselves could develop their own comprehensive smoking ban and he 's promised to put that issue on the agenda of the next meeting of state premiers in dresden in october .
" it is sensible for the states to reach as much of an amicable consensus on non-smoker protection as possible and to prevent a patchwork of regulations across the country , " koch said .
" we should also agree not to turn this into a political debate . " marlies volkmer , the social democratic spokeswoman for the german parliament 's committee for nutrition , agriculture and consumer protection , agreed . " the state parliaments are now called upon to use their discretion in order to impose a general smoking ban , " she said .
" only a consistent approach will truly serve health protection measures and would be completely clear for both pub owners and guests .

an annual flu jab for the under fives could reduce some types of infection by up to 70 % , a team at the health protection agency reported .
they say immunising children would particularly protect the elderly .
children are prolific spreaders of infection because they have lower immunity and come into close contact with their families and each other .
the findings prompted calls for a reassessment of government policy .
in the us , flu vaccination is already offered to children aged from six months to five years . "
i would say parents in the uk would probably turn around and give it a thumbs down , so the jcvi will want to be 100 % sure of the evidence " professor john oxford but in 2006 , after reviewing the evidence available at the time , the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation -lrb- jcvi -rrb- decided not to recommend a similar programme in the uk .
the elderly and people with high-risk conditions , such as asthma , are offered a flu vaccine every year .
the latest study estimated the effects of vaccination in the under-twos , under-fives and under-16s on two types of flu .
it showed that the more children who received vaccination , the greater was the protection to the population in general .
if an annual vaccination programme included everyone under the age of 16 , the incidence of both influenza a and influenza b could drop by more than 90 % , the researchers found .
just immunising those aged between six months and two years would reduce flu in the population by between 11 % and 35 % , depending on the strain .
' not real data ' but including those up to the age of five years could reduce influenza a by up to 38 % and influenza b by up to 69 % .
from the today programme more from today programme in the model the researchers assumed that 60 % of children were vaccinated .
a spokesperson for the jcvi said it was keeping the issue under review and was awaiting the outcome of further studies being done on the effects of flu vaccine in children .
dr george kassianos , immunisation spokesperson for the royal college of gps , said the college had been calling for the introduction of influenza vaccination in children for the past five or six years .
" the children themselves fare very badly from influenza but they are also the source of infection for many adults .
" there is an urgent need for the jcvi to review their decision . "
professor john oxford , an expert in virology at barts and the london , queen mary 's school of medicine and dentistry said the evidence all seemed to be pointing towards a benefit .
but he added : " this is mathematical modelling which is not quite the same as getting real data .
he added : " i would say parents in the uk would probably turn around and give it a thumbs down , so the jcvi will want to be 100 % sure of the evidence . "
dr keith prowse , chairman of the british lung foundation , said : " vaccinating all children annually would be a huge undertaking and one that should n't be taken lightly .
" the rationale , benefits and implementation would have to be very carefully explained and communicated to the population at large and a decision taken in consultation with all interested parties . "

dr richard halvorsen and emma soames discuss the flu jab vaccinating children against flu would prevent the spread of the virus in the whole population , research suggests .
an annual flu jab for the under fives could reduce some types of infection by up to 70 % , a team at the health protection agency reported .
they say immunising children would particularly protect the elderly .
children are prolific spreaders of infection because they have lower immunity and come into close contact with their families and each other .
the findings prompted calls for a reassessment of government policy .
in the us , flu vaccination is already offered to children aged from six months to five years .
i would say parents in the uk would probably turn around and give it a thumbs down , so the jcvi will want to be 100 % sure of the evidence professor john oxford but in 2006 , after reviewing the evidence available at the time , the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation -lrb- jcvi -rrb- decided not to recommend a similar programme in the uk .
the elderly and people with high-risk conditions , such as asthma , are offered a flu vaccine every year .
the latest study estimated the effects of vaccination in the under-twos , under-fives and under-16s on two types of flu .
it showed that the more children who received vaccination , the greater was the protection to the population in general .
if an annual vaccination programme included everyone under the age of 16 , the incidence of both influenza a and influenza b could drop by more than 90 % , the researchers found .
just immunising those aged between six months and two years would reduce flu in the population by between 11 % and 35 % , depending on the strain .
' not real data ' but including those up to the age of five years could reduce influenza a by up to 38 % and influenza b by up to 69 % .

although the illness is no longer regarded as terminal , it is still a chronic condition .
high costs of treatment and care are involved and , every year , thousands of people are diagnosed with hiv for the first time .
in recent years , the yorkshire and humber region has seen increasing numbers of people accessing hiv-related care .

gay men 's health leaflets sit alongside information on breast feeding , and the service has introduced a creche to cater for the growing number of african women with children .
tom doyle , director of yorkshire mesmac , a leeds-based hiv service which recently merged with begin , said : " traditionally , social services for people living with hiv were set up by and for gay men .
" up until fairly recently , the vast majority of begin 's service users were gay men .

begin is located on an anonymous industrial estate near a desolate railway station .

zimbabwe to west yorkshire one woman who uses the service is gugulethu , 45 , who is from zimbabwe .
she did not want to give the bbc her real name , instead using that of her late daughter which translates as " precious " - all the more poignant given that her daughter died of aids at the age of 27 , leaving behind a little boy who is also hiv positive and increasingly ill .
gugulethu came to the uk in 2003 as a political asylum seeker .
she was dispersed to west yorkshire and has lived in wakefield ever since .

sheila mudge said many people moved to north kent 's remote hoo peninsula to work for kingsnorth power station .
" people are asking why they are coming - it 's our power station , " she said .
activists want to halt plans for a coal-fired unit at kingsnorth .
they said hoo was rich in renewable energy sources such as tide and wind power .
mrs mudge has lived in the village of hoo st werburgh for 29 years and edits the local village voices newsletter which is sponsored by e.on uk , the company that runs kingsnorth .
she said : " we 've always had the power station .
people work there .
it 's part of our life . "
wind and tide power adding that she used to live in bells lane , where she could see both grain and kingsnorth power stations from her window , she said : " if you do n't want to live near a power station you do n't move there . "
she added : " a lot of people came to the village because of work .
my husband , when we got married , was working out of grain power station . "
this year 's climate camp at kingsnorth is the third annual protest - last year it was at heathrow .
mrs mudge said there was " a reason " why people supported a climate camp at heathrow .
" they were in arms against the new runway , " she said . "
we are talking about rising sea levels ... people are going to lose their homes " peter mcdonnell but she said " very few people " near the power station opposed e.on uk 's plans for a coal-fired unit - and most objections to what was a " world issue " came from " further afield " .
camp participant peter mcdonnell said climate change would affect " every single one of us " .
he said : " in the context of the hoo peninsula , we are talking about rising sea levels .
" large areas will go - people are going to lose their homes . "
he said activists would prioritise any local concerns during the camp , but added : " local concerns are going to be nothing compared with the inconvenience people will face in the future if we do n't start changing our ways . "
he said campaigners received a " mixed response " from the hoo community , but locals did not " unanimously oppose " them .
activists played football with local youth and were in turn invited to the pub , while some villagers were joining the camp for the week , he added .
and mr mcdonnell said there would be " more jobs " in the power sector if " sensible decisions " were made .
he said protesters wanted a " just transition " towards a post-carbon society that did not see workers in the fossil fuel industry " ending up on the scrap heap " .
mr mcdonnell said the peninsula was " rich " in renewable energy sources , such as wind and tide power .
and germany currently employed 250,000 people in high-skilled jobs in the renewable energy sector and had been " much more successful " than the uk , he added .

sheila mudge said many people moved to north kent 's remote hoo peninsula to work for kingsnorth power station .
" people are asking why they are coming - it 's our power station , " she said .
activists want to halt plans for a coal-fired unit at kingsnorth .
they said hoo was rich in renewable energy sources such as tide and wind power .
mrs mudge has lived in the village of hoo st werburgh for 29 years and edits the local village voices newsletter which is sponsored by e.on uk , the company that runs kingsnorth .
she said : " we 've always had the power station .

wind and tide power adding that she used to live in bells lane , where she could see both grain and kingsnorth power stations from her window , she said : " if you do n't want to live near a power station you do n't move there . "
she added : " a lot of people came to the village because of work .
my husband , when we got married , was working out of grain power station . "
this year 's climate camp at kingsnorth is the third annual protest - last year it was at heathrow .
mrs mudge said there was " a reason " why people supported a climate camp at heathrow .

he has also asked to meet representatives of ethnic groups , political parties and ngos , as well as travel to parts of the irrawaddy delta to see the effect of may 's devastating cyclone , the statement said .
