russia announced the start of a pullback from georgia on monday , but georgia said it had seen no signs of russian forces withdrawing .
if anything , the foreign ministry said they were broadening their presence . russia 's military announced the start of the departure of russian forces from georgia on monday , august 18 .
" the pullout of peacekeeping forces started today , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovizyn told a daily official briefing .
" russia has finished the operation on halting georgia 's aggression against south ossetia . "
nogovitsyn also said , however , there had been a misunderstanding about president dmitry medvedev 's promise to his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy about whether russia would fully withdraw its forces from the caucasus republic .
" there is a distinction between the understandings of a ' pullback ' and a ' withdrawal ' .
in the conversation with french president sarkozy , the discussion was about an pullback of forces , not a withdrawal , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgians have been displaced in the fighting russian forces will pull back to the borders of south ossetia , the moscow-backed separatist region of georgia at the center of the conflict , nogovitsyn added .
he declined to answer a question about how many russian troops would remain in georgia , saying : " i am not ready to name any figures . "
georgia disputes pullout report nogovizyn said the pullout included russian troops in gori , in central georgia .
reports said the withdrawal initially involved groups of between five and 10 armoured vehicles .
they were seen heading toward the roki tunnel , which connects russia and georgia in the caucasus mountain region of south ossetia .
however , comments from us and russian leaders indicate that moscow may not , in fact , be leaving the area any time soon .
georgian deputy foreign minister giga bokeria said that russian forces appeared bent on inflicting as much damage as possible on the georgian economy .
" there are no signs at all that russian forces are pulling out , " he told reuters .
" quite the opposite .
they are spreading out to other regions . "
he gave no details .
a top georgian official also said russian forces are actually heading deeper into georgian territory from the central city of khashuri , despite the pull-out pledge , the afp news service reported .
reports of munitions destruction and georgia interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili said those russian forces that did appear to be pulling out were leaving a trail of destroyed munitions in their wake .
the russians were blowing up stores of georgian ammunition and weaponry at a base near the western town of senaki ahead of a planned withdrawal from georgia , utiashvili said .
he also said moscow 's troops had destroyed the runway at the base .
" they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places , " he said .
" if they call this a pullout , then i do not understand the meaning of the word . "
missile launchers said moved into region moreover , the russian military has been moving launchers for short-range ballistic missiles into the disputed caucuses region , american officials told the international herald tribune newspaper .
the step appears intended to tighten moscow 's hold on the breakaway territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has vowed to crush opponents the russian military deployed several ss-21 missile launchers and supply vehicles to south ossetia on friday , according to american officials familiar with intelligence reports .
from the new launching positions north of tskhinvali , the south ossetian capital , the missiles can reach much of georgia , including tbilisi , the capital .
cnn news web site reported that the head of the russian parliament 's foreign affairs committee , konstantin kosachev , said moscow would completely withdraw only when it was " assured that georgians would not continue to use military force " in the breakaway regions .
moscow to leave ' sooner or later , ' official says russian troops will leave " sooner or later , " kosachev said , saying the timetable depends " definitely on how georgians will continue to behave . "
" if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq , for example , the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there , " kosachev told cnn .
" the same answer would be toward this situation . "
russian president dmitry medvedev initially sent forces into georgia in support of pro-moscow separatists there on august 8 .
since , then , pressure has been mounting on russia to pull its troops out of the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow and tbilisi signed a ceasefire agreement late last week aimed at putting an end to the week-long conflict , and set the date for the pull-out .
but moscow 's tone has remained belligerent .
medvedev promises ' crushing response ' speaking to a group of world war ii veterans on monday , medvedev warned against any further georgian action .
" if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished , we will never allow this .
if anyone tries this again , we will come out with a crushing response , " medvedev told his audience in the russian city of kursk .
" we have all the necessary resources , political , economic and military .
if anyone had any illusions about this , they have to abandon them , " medvedev said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.08.2008 us missile shield gains popular support in poland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish and us officials have agreed to missile defense scheme amid swaying public opinion russia 's conflict with georgia has caused a swing in public opinion in poland over hosting us missile interceptors on polish soil , according to a new poll . fifty-eight percent of poles canvassed said they now supported the pentagon 's plan to base 10 missile interceptors in poland , while 46 percent were against the scheme .
the poll , conducted by rzeczpospolita newspaper , said 45 percent of respondents expected poland 's security to be strengthened by the missile shield .
thirty percent , however , believed it would be weakened .
us and polish diplomats came to an agreement over the anti-missile deal last week .
under the pact , poland is to receive patriot air defense missiles and a special pledge of us military cooperation in the case of threats against poland .
polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and us secretary of state condoleezza rice are to sign the deal wednesday in warsaw .
in early july , a similar poll found 53 percent of poles opposed the missile shield , part of a planned pentagon system that also includes a tracking radar in czech republic , which was agreed in july .
parliamentary approval is still required in both countries .
the latest survey was based on interviews of 500 people by pollster gfk polonia .
the margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
us-russia relations simmer over shield the us says the system , designed to destroy incoming ballistic missiles , is intended to defend against growing threats from so-called rogue states such as iran and north korea .
russia , however , vehemently opposes the shield , insisting it is aimed at containing moscow 's arsenal of strategic nuclear missiles - a charge the us denies .
rice will travel to moscow after a us-requested emergency meeting of nato nations in brussels to discuss the alliance 's reaction to the recent conflict in the caucasus .
the us-poland deal " is an important step in our efforts to protect the united states and our european allies from the growing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack said sunday . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de us-poland missile deal riles already belligerent russia moscow continued to bristle over thursday 's deal between the us and poland over the stationing of parts of the proposed missile defense shield on russia 's borders , going as far as to say it made poland a military target .

the poll , conducted by rzeczpospolita newspaper , said 45 percent of respondents expected poland 's security to be strengthened by the missile shield .
thirty percent , however , believed it would be weakened .
us and polish diplomats came to an agreement over the anti-missile deal last week .
under the pact , poland is to receive patriot air defense missiles and a special pledge of us military cooperation in the case of threats against poland .
polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and us secretary of state condoleezza rice are to sign the deal wednesday in warsaw .
in early july , a similar poll found 53 percent of poles opposed the missile shield , part of a planned pentagon system that also includes a tracking radar in czech republic , which was agreed in july .
parliamentary approval is still required in both countries .

the margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .

russia , however , vehemently opposes the shield , insisting it is aimed at containing moscow 's arsenal of strategic nuclear missiles - a charge the us denies .
rice will travel to moscow after a us-requested emergency meeting of nato nations in brussels to discuss the alliance 's reaction to the recent conflict in the caucasus .

18 , that 24.9 percent of its newly formed subsidiary db mobility logistics , which is now home to db 's passenger and logistics operations , would be listed on the stock market in the coming months . analysts have said the planned partial privatization of europe 's biggest rail group should generate about 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.8 billion -rrb- , with db having launched a drive for international investors to buy into the share listing . db said the group 's earnings before interest , tax and special items rose 6.8 percent to 1.4 billion euros during the first half of the year with net profit increasing by 5.4 percent to 915 million euros . " never before have so many people in germany traveled on db trains in the first half -lrb- of the year -rrb- , and never before were more goods transported by rail , " said mehdorn . the rail company said revenue jumped by 8.2 percent to 16.6 billion euros in the six months to the end of june compared to the same period last year . passenger traffic increased by 3 percent to a record 941 million , which corresponds on average to about 5.2 million people travelling on db 's trains each day . db 's higher figures may in some part also be attributed to its increasing of commuter and main-line fares by 2.9 percent last september . the volume of db 's goods traffic rose 26.3 percent to 197 million tons . under the group 's sell-off plan , the state would have a 75.1-percent stake of db 's passenger and freight operations .

but the german development ministry have denied his claims . bonde told the german news magazine der spiegel that of the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million -rrb- that the germany 's development ministry -lrb- bmz -rrb- allocated for rebuilding projects in afghanistan in 2007 , 20 million euros was never spent .
he said that the slow pace of the aid contradicts the government 's claims that civilian reconstruction remains its top priority in afghanistan .
it is a problem that could be set to continue this year .
the ministry had only spent a third of its reconstruction budget in the first six months of 2008 .
bonde blames german bureaucratic hurdles for the delay .
ministry denies slowdown bildunterschrift : some feel reconstruction has been too slow the development ministry denied bonde 's accusations , calling them " unjustifiable and false , " according to the dpa news agency .
the ministry spokesman said that half of the money earmarked for afghanistan is part of long-term authorizations .
germany 's long-term commitments in afghanistan are transferred over the course of several years because most of the programs take place over a three or seven-year duration , the ministry said .
bonde said he was n't satisfied with this answer .
" my criticism is based on official numbers from the foreign ministry , " he said .
" as long as the bmz does n't provide other concrete numbers , the denial has no value , " he said in a written response reported by the dpa news agency .
he called for a clarification from the government on what money has actually been spent .
sensitive to criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany helps train afghanistan 's security forces germany 's left-right coalition government has come under repeated criticism for putting military aid ahead of humanitarian help .
germany has about 3,500 troops taking part in a nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
german police officers are also involved in training afghan security forces .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited afghanistan in july and emphasized germany 's involvement new roads and schools .
civilian aid remained the focus of german help to kabul , steinmeier said .
unpopular mission yet even as germany 's top politicians emphasize humanitarian aid , the government has been pushing for an increase in the number of peacekeeping troops .
germany 's participation in the isaf mission is unpopular at home .
but , the government has said that it needs more troops to improve security in afghanistan , which is currently experiencing an upsurge in violence orchestrated by the taliban .

he said that the slow pace of the aid contradicts the government 's claims that civilian reconstruction remains its top priority in afghanistan .
it is a problem that could be set to continue this year .
the ministry had only spent a third of its reconstruction budget in the first six months of 2008 .
bonde blames german bureaucratic hurdles for the delay .

germany 's long-term commitments in afghanistan are transferred over the course of several years because most of the programs take place over a three or seven-year duration , the ministry said .
bonde said he was n't satisfied with this answer .
" my criticism is based on official numbers from the foreign ministry , " he said .
" as long as the bmz does n't provide other concrete numbers , the denial has no value , " he said in a written response reported by the dpa news agency .
he called for a clarification from the government on what money has actually been spent .

russia announced the start of a pullback from georgia on monday , but georgia said it had seen no signs of russian forces withdrawing .
if anything , the foreign ministry said they were broadening their presence . russia 's military announced the start of the departure of russian forces from georgia on monday , august 18 .
" the pullout of peacekeeping forces started today , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovizyn told a daily official briefing .
" russia has finished the operation on halting georgia 's aggression against south ossetia . "
nogovitsyn also said , however , there had been a misunderstanding about president dmitry medvedev 's promise to his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy about whether russia would fully withdraw its forces from the caucasus republic .
" there is a distinction between the understandings of a ' pullback ' and a ' withdrawal ' .
in the conversation with french president sarkozy , the discussion was about an pullback of forces , not a withdrawal , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgians have been displaced in the fighting russian forces will pull back to the borders of south ossetia , the moscow-backed separatist region of georgia at the center of the conflict , nogovitsyn added .
he declined to answer a question about how many russian troops would remain in georgia , saying : " i am not ready to name any figures . "
georgia disputes pullout report nogovizyn said the pullout included russian troops in gori , in central georgia .
reports said the withdrawal initially involved groups of between five and 10 armoured vehicles .
they were seen heading toward the roki tunnel , which connects russia and georgia in the caucasus mountain region of south ossetia .
however , comments from us and russian leaders indicate that moscow may not , in fact , be leaving the area any time soon .
georgian deputy foreign minister giga bokeria said that russian forces appeared bent on inflicting as much damage as possible on the georgian economy .
" there are no signs at all that russian forces are pulling out , " he told reuters .
" quite the opposite .
they are spreading out to other regions . "
he gave no details .
a top georgian official also said russian forces are actually heading deeper into georgian territory from the central city of khashuri , despite the pull-out pledge , the afp news service reported .
reports of munitions destruction and georgia interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili said those russian forces that did appear to be pulling out were leaving a trail of destroyed munitions in their wake .
the russians were blowing up stores of georgian ammunition and weaponry at a base near the western town of senaki ahead of a planned withdrawal from georgia , utiashvili said .
he also said moscow 's troops had destroyed the runway at the base .
" they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places , " he said .
" if they call this a pullout , then i do not understand the meaning of the word . "
missile launchers said moved into region moreover , the russian military has been moving launchers for short-range ballistic missiles into the disputed caucuses region , american officials told the international herald tribune newspaper .
the step appears intended to tighten moscow 's hold on the breakaway territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has vowed to crush opponents the russian military deployed several ss-21 missile launchers and supply vehicles to south ossetia on friday , according to american officials familiar with intelligence reports .
from the new launching positions north of tskhinvali , the south ossetian capital , the missiles can reach much of georgia , including tbilisi , the capital .
cnn news web site reported that the head of the russian parliament 's foreign affairs committee , konstantin kosachev , said moscow would completely withdraw only when it was " assured that georgians would not continue to use military force " in the breakaway regions .
moscow to leave ' sooner or later , ' official says russian troops will leave " sooner or later , " kosachev said , saying the timetable depends " definitely on how georgians will continue to behave . "
" if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq , for example , the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there , " kosachev told cnn .
" the same answer would be toward this situation . "
russian president dmitry medvedev initially sent forces into georgia in support of pro-moscow separatists there on august 8 .
since , then , pressure has been mounting on russia to pull its troops out of the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow and tbilisi signed a ceasefire agreement late last week aimed at putting an end to the week-long conflict , and set the date for the pull-out .
but moscow 's tone has remained belligerent .
medvedev promises ' crushing response ' speaking to a group of world war ii veterans on monday , medvedev warned against any further georgian action .
" if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished , we will never allow this .
if anyone tries this again , we will come out with a crushing response , " medvedev told his audience in the russian city of kursk .
" we have all the necessary resources , political , economic and military .
if anyone had any illusions about this , they have to abandon them , " medvedev said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , that 24.9 percent of its newly formed subsidiary db mobility logistics , which is now home to db 's passenger and logistics operations , would be listed on the stock market in the coming months . analysts have said the planned partial privatization of europe 's biggest rail group should generate about 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.8 billion -rrb- , with db having launched a drive for international investors to buy into the share listing . db said the group 's earnings before interest , tax and special items rose 6.8 percent to 1.4 billion euros during the first half of the year with net profit increasing by 5.4 percent to 915 million euros .

the poll , conducted by rzeczpospolita newspaper , said 45 percent of respondents expected poland 's security to be strengthened by the missile shield .
thirty percent , however , believed it would be weakened .
us and polish diplomats came to an agreement over the anti-missile deal last week .
under the pact , poland is to receive patriot air defense missiles and a special pledge of us military cooperation in the case of threats against poland .
polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and us secretary of state condoleezza rice are to sign the deal wednesday in warsaw .
in early july , a similar poll found 53 percent of poles opposed the missile shield , part of a planned pentagon system that also includes a tracking radar in czech republic , which was agreed in july .
parliamentary approval is still required in both countries .
the latest survey was based on interviews of 500 people by pollster gfk polonia .
the margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
us-russia relations simmer over shield the us says the system , designed to destroy incoming ballistic missiles , is intended to defend against growing threats from so-called rogue states such as iran and north korea .
russia , however , vehemently opposes the shield , insisting it is aimed at containing moscow 's arsenal of strategic nuclear missiles - a charge the us denies .
rice will travel to moscow after a us-requested emergency meeting of nato nations in brussels to discuss the alliance 's reaction to the recent conflict in the caucasus .
the us-poland deal " is an important step in our efforts to protect the united states and our european allies from the growing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack said sunday . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thirty percent , however , believed it would be weakened .

polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and us secretary of state condoleezza rice are to sign the deal wednesday in warsaw .

rice will travel to moscow after a us-requested emergency meeting of nato nations in brussels to discuss the alliance 's reaction to the recent conflict in the caucasus .

the poll , conducted by rzeczpospolita newspaper , said 45 percent of respondents expected poland 's security to be strengthened by the missile shield .
thirty percent , however , believed it would be weakened .
us and polish diplomats came to an agreement over the anti-missile deal last week .
under the pact , poland is to receive patriot air defense missiles and a special pledge of us military cooperation in the case of threats against poland .
polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and us secretary of state condoleezza rice are to sign the deal wednesday in warsaw .
in early july , a similar poll found 53 percent of poles opposed the missile shield , part of a planned pentagon system that also includes a tracking radar in czech republic , which was agreed in july .
parliamentary approval is still required in both countries .
the latest survey was based on interviews of 500 people by pollster gfk polonia .
the margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
us-russia relations simmer over shield the us says the system , designed to destroy incoming ballistic missiles , is intended to defend against growing threats from so-called rogue states such as iran and north korea .
russia , however , vehemently opposes the shield , insisting it is aimed at containing moscow 's arsenal of strategic nuclear missiles - a charge the us denies .
rice will travel to moscow after a us-requested emergency meeting of nato nations in brussels to discuss the alliance 's reaction to the recent conflict in the caucasus .
the us-poland deal " is an important step in our efforts to protect the united states and our european allies from the growing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack said sunday . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if anything , the foreign ministry said they were broadening their presence . russia 's military announced the start of the departure of russian forces from georgia on monday , august 18 .
" the pullout of peacekeeping forces started today , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovizyn told a daily official briefing .
" russia has finished the operation on halting georgia 's aggression against south ossetia . "
nogovitsyn also said , however , there had been a misunderstanding about president dmitry medvedev 's promise to his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy about whether russia would fully withdraw its forces from the caucasus republic .
" there is a distinction between the understandings of a ' pullback ' and a ' withdrawal ' .
in the conversation with french president sarkozy , the discussion was about an pullback of forces , not a withdrawal , " he said .

he declined to answer a question about how many russian troops would remain in georgia , saying : " i am not ready to name any figures . "
georgia disputes pullout report nogovizyn said the pullout included russian troops in gori , in central georgia .
reports said the withdrawal initially involved groups of between five and 10 armoured vehicles .
they were seen heading toward the roki tunnel , which connects russia and georgia in the caucasus mountain region of south ossetia .
however , comments from us and russian leaders indicate that moscow may not , in fact , be leaving the area any time soon .
georgian deputy foreign minister giga bokeria said that russian forces appeared bent on inflicting as much damage as possible on the georgian economy .
" there are no signs at all that russian forces are pulling out , " he told reuters .
" quite the opposite .
they are spreading out to other regions . "
he gave no details .
a top georgian official also said russian forces are actually heading deeper into georgian territory from the central city of khashuri , despite the pull-out pledge , the afp news service reported .
reports of munitions destruction and georgia interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili said those russian forces that did appear to be pulling out were leaving a trail of destroyed munitions in their wake .
the russians were blowing up stores of georgian ammunition and weaponry at a base near the western town of senaki ahead of a planned withdrawal from georgia , utiashvili said .
he also said moscow 's troops had destroyed the runway at the base .
" they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places , " he said .
" if they call this a pullout , then i do not understand the meaning of the word . "
missile launchers said moved into region moreover , the russian military has been moving launchers for short-range ballistic missiles into the disputed caucuses region , american officials told the international herald tribune newspaper .
the step appears intended to tighten moscow 's hold on the breakaway territory .

" the same answer would be toward this situation . "
russian president dmitry medvedev initially sent forces into georgia in support of pro-moscow separatists there on august 8 .

" the pullout of peacekeeping forces started today , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovizyn told a daily official briefing .
" russia has finished the operation on halting georgia 's aggression against south ossetia . "
nogovitsyn also said , however , there had been a misunderstanding about president dmitry medvedev 's promise to his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy about whether russia would fully withdraw its forces from the caucasus republic .
" there is a distinction between the understandings of a ' pullback ' and a ' withdrawal ' .
in the conversation with french president sarkozy , the discussion was about an pullback of forces , not a withdrawal , " he said .

reports said the withdrawal initially involved groups of between five and 10 armoured vehicles .
they were seen heading toward the roki tunnel , which connects russia and georgia in the caucasus mountain region of south ossetia .
however , comments from us and russian leaders indicate that moscow may not , in fact , be leaving the area any time soon .
georgian deputy foreign minister giga bokeria said that russian forces appeared bent on inflicting as much damage as possible on the georgian economy .

medvedev promises ' crushing response ' speaking to a group of world war ii veterans on monday , medvedev warned against any further georgian action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 18.08.2008 bundesbank warns of inflation risks despite slower growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesbank president axel weber and the ecb are fighting inflation germany 's central bank ruled out a dramatic slump in europe 's biggest economy in its monthly report released monday , aug .
18 , but warned inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched . despite fears that germany could be edging towards a sharp downturn , the bundesbank 's august bulletin did not see the nation 's economy spiraling downwards in the coming months .
but it said the nation was facing " an economic lean period during the second half of the year . "
the bundesbank bulletin expressed concerns that inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched in germany and among its partners in the 15-member eurozone and that slowing growth was unlikely to dampen price pressures .
" despite general caution in estimating the growth outlook for the euro zone , inflation expectations of market participants , according to surveys and financial market data , have been higher of late than can be reconciled with price stability over the long run , " the bundesbank said .
shrink in economy wo n't dampen fears : bundesbank data released last week by germany 's statistics office showed the economy shrank for the first time in almost four years during the second quarter , contracting by 0.5 percent on the quarter .
but the bundesbank said the second-quarter contraction was a reaction to the solid growth rate germany clocked up during the first three months of the year when the economy grew by 1.3 percent .
the bundesbank , which takes a hardline anti-inflation stance , does not expect slowing growth to undercut the inflationary pressures that have built up in the eurozone as a result of higher food and energy prices .
" the fact that the pace of growth is likely to slow does not mean that this will be enough to counteract stability concerns , nor will it automatically balance out inflationary pressures , " the central bank said .
bundesbank chief axel weber is a member of the european central bank 's 21-head rate-setting council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank has taken measures to fight inflation in the eurozone last month the frankfurt-based ecb raised its benchmark refinancing rate by 25 percent basis points to 4.25 percent in a bid to ward off resurgent inflation .
" it 's the duty of monetary policy to prevent increased price risks from translating into a long-lasting higher inflation rate , " the bank said .
continuous growth in german economy ends the second-quarter drop in germany 's growth brought to an end a solid economic upswing in recent years , with the economy chalking up a growth rate last year of 2.5 percent .
adjusted for working days , the german economy grew by 1.7 percent year-on-year in the three months to the end of june , based on last week 's statistics office data . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but other afflictions keep them from being able to show the same physical results as their younger people , german scientists found . a team led by janina boyke , from the department of systems neuroscience at the university of hamburg , undertook a test project to teach 69 healthy german men and women between the ages of 50 and 67 to juggle . in this case , juggling involved keeping three balls in motion for a minimum of 60 seconds , which can also sometimes be a challenge for young and agile minds and bodies . none of the test subjects had ever attempted to juggle before in their lives .
while none of them learned to juggle with any great proficiency , brain scans showed that they had learned a new skill and that their brains had structurally registered the new learning . learning-induced structural changes in the human brain were previously measured in young adults using high-resolution , three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry , which allows for the mapping of sections of the brain . boyke and her colleagues extended this research to show that such structural changes also occur in older adults . use it or lose it - at all ages as in the previous study , subjects were scanned three times : before learning to juggle , after three months of juggling and after three additional months following the cessation of the juggling instruction . although the older adults did not learn to juggle as well as younger adults , those who did learn showed similar increases in grey matter in the visual motion area of their brains . unlike young adults , older subject who learned to juggle had increased grey matter in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens compared to the control group . as in young adults , these grey-matter changes were transient , returning to baseline after three months without practice .
the results indicate that human brains retain some structural plasticity as they age , scientists said . the authors said the findings indicate older brains can retain the youthful ability to learn new skills . however , they caution that age-linked limitations such as poorer hand-eye coordination and neural function could impede the process as people age . in your 60s , you may not be able to become a first-rate professional juggler .
but it will not be because of limitations in your brain , but because you may have arthritis and need trifocals . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" more and more the sentiment is that the former chancellor has an imbalanced relationship from his previous position , " christian social union foreign policy spokesman karl-theodor zu guttenberg told the passauer neuen presse on monday , aug .
18 .
" each of his declarations is an affront to foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " gazprom connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder heads nord stream project , which is heavily connected to gazprom schroeder 's critics have said such derision may have also been catalyzed by the fact that the former chancellor has firm connections with russian energy giant gazprom . schroeder currently chairs the nord stream consortium , an energy concern overseeing a planned natural gas pipeline from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
the pipeline would bypass countries such as poland and lithuania , thus depriving them of tax revenue . gazprom is a major player in nord stream , of which schroeder was a major proponent while still in office .
he initialed the go-ahead for the baltic project , along with then russian president vladimir putin , in september 2005 , only weeks before the end of his tenure as chancellor . eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the christian democratic union parliamentary party faction , touched on this in his criticism of the former chancellor . " the recriminations were predictable , " he told 24-hour news channel n-tv on monday .
" schroeder is the prominent voice of moscow in germany . " the free-market liberal fpd party secretary general dirk niebel told the station he thought schroeder was willing to do anything his employer asked . " -lsb- schroeder 's -rsb- one-sided attribution of blame is in line with the motto : he who pays the piper calls the tune , " niebel said . reoccurring controversy tracking back to 2005 , a mere two weeks after he left office , whispers of corruption surfaced after it became apparent schroeder may sign on with gazprom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us military flew 2,000 georgian troops home from iraq after georgia recalled them editorialists at several german newspapers as well as politicians of germany 's political parties were highly critical of his planned involvement with nord stream . schroeder , however , continues to insist the eu press ahead with forming a " strategic partnership " with russia , saying europe risked losing influence and pushing moscow towards china if it did not work with the kremlin . other european politicians , particularly in capitals of former soviet satellite nations , have called for a re-evaluation of european-russian ties . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 18.08.2008 bundesbank warns of inflation risks despite slower growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesbank president axel weber and the ecb are fighting inflation germany 's central bank ruled out a dramatic slump in europe 's biggest economy in its monthly report released monday , aug .
18 , but warned inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched . despite fears that germany could be edging towards a sharp downturn , the bundesbank 's august bulletin did not see the nation 's economy spiraling downwards in the coming months .
but it said the nation was facing " an economic lean period during the second half of the year . "
the bundesbank bulletin expressed concerns that inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched in germany and among its partners in the 15-member eurozone and that slowing growth was unlikely to dampen price pressures .
" despite general caution in estimating the growth outlook for the euro zone , inflation expectations of market participants , according to surveys and financial market data , have been higher of late than can be reconciled with price stability over the long run , " the bundesbank said .
shrink in economy wo n't dampen fears : bundesbank data released last week by germany 's statistics office showed the economy shrank for the first time in almost four years during the second quarter , contracting by 0.5 percent on the quarter .
but the bundesbank said the second-quarter contraction was a reaction to the solid growth rate germany clocked up during the first three months of the year when the economy grew by 1.3 percent .
the bundesbank , which takes a hardline anti-inflation stance , does not expect slowing growth to undercut the inflationary pressures that have built up in the eurozone as a result of higher food and energy prices .
" the fact that the pace of growth is likely to slow does not mean that this will be enough to counteract stability concerns , nor will it automatically balance out inflationary pressures , " the central bank said .
bundesbank chief axel weber is a member of the european central bank 's 21-head rate-setting council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank has taken measures to fight inflation in the eurozone last month the frankfurt-based ecb raised its benchmark refinancing rate by 25 percent basis points to 4.25 percent in a bid to ward off resurgent inflation .
" it 's the duty of monetary policy to prevent increased price risks from translating into a long-lasting higher inflation rate , " the bank said .
continuous growth in german economy ends the second-quarter drop in germany 's growth brought to an end a solid economic upswing in recent years , with the economy chalking up a growth rate last year of 2.5 percent .
adjusted for working days , the german economy grew by 1.7 percent year-on-year in the three months to the end of june , based on last week 's statistics office data . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the poll , conducted by rzeczpospolita newspaper , said 45 percent of respondents expected poland 's security to be strengthened by the missile shield .
thirty percent , however , believed it would be weakened .
us and polish diplomats came to an agreement over the anti-missile deal last week .
under the pact , poland is to receive patriot air defense missiles and a special pledge of us military cooperation in the case of threats against poland .
polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and us secretary of state condoleezza rice are to sign the deal wednesday in warsaw .
in early july , a similar poll found 53 percent of poles opposed the missile shield , part of a planned pentagon system that also includes a tracking radar in czech republic , which was agreed in july .
parliamentary approval is still required in both countries .
the latest survey was based on interviews of 500 people by pollster gfk polonia .
the margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
us-russia relations simmer over shield the us says the system , designed to destroy incoming ballistic missiles , is intended to defend against growing threats from so-called rogue states such as iran and north korea .
russia , however , vehemently opposes the shield , insisting it is aimed at containing moscow 's arsenal of strategic nuclear missiles - a charge the us denies .
rice will travel to moscow after a us-requested emergency meeting of nato nations in brussels to discuss the alliance 's reaction to the recent conflict in the caucasus .
the us-poland deal " is an important step in our efforts to protect the united states and our european allies from the growing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack said sunday . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , that 24.9 percent of its newly formed subsidiary db mobility logistics , which is now home to db 's passenger and logistics operations , would be listed on the stock market in the coming months . analysts have said the planned partial privatization of europe 's biggest rail group should generate about 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.8 billion -rrb- , with db having launched a drive for international investors to buy into the share listing . db said the group 's earnings before interest , tax and special items rose 6.8 percent to 1.4 billion euros during the first half of the year with net profit increasing by 5.4 percent to 915 million euros . " never before have so many people in germany traveled on db trains in the first half -lrb- of the year -rrb- , and never before were more goods transported by rail , " said mehdorn . the rail company said revenue jumped by 8.2 percent to 16.6 billion euros in the six months to the end of june compared to the same period last year . passenger traffic increased by 3 percent to a record 941 million , which corresponds on average to about 5.2 million people travelling on db 's trains each day . db 's higher figures may in some part also be attributed to its increasing of commuter and main-line fares by 2.9 percent last september . the volume of db 's goods traffic rose 26.3 percent to 197 million tons . under the group 's sell-off plan , the state would have a 75.1-percent stake of db 's passenger and freight operations .
however , the partial privatization means that berlin would retain 100 percent control of the rail company 's railway stations as well as its 34,000 kilometers -lrb- 21,748 miles -rrb- of track network and its energy supplier operations . the bahn also announced monday it would be increasing fares in december .
increases in fuel and personnel costs forced the company to raise ticket prices , mehdorn said . the rail company said it would specify the exact amount of the increase in september .

18 , but warned inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched . despite fears that germany could be edging towards a sharp downturn , the bundesbank 's august bulletin did not see the nation 's economy spiraling downwards in the coming months .
but it said the nation was facing " an economic lean period during the second half of the year . "
the bundesbank bulletin expressed concerns that inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched in germany and among its partners in the 15-member eurozone and that slowing growth was unlikely to dampen price pressures .
" despite general caution in estimating the growth outlook for the euro zone , inflation expectations of market participants , according to surveys and financial market data , have been higher of late than can be reconciled with price stability over the long run , " the bundesbank said .
shrink in economy wo n't dampen fears : bundesbank data released last week by germany 's statistics office showed the economy shrank for the first time in almost four years during the second quarter , contracting by 0.5 percent on the quarter .
but the bundesbank said the second-quarter contraction was a reaction to the solid growth rate germany clocked up during the first three months of the year when the economy grew by 1.3 percent .
the bundesbank , which takes a hardline anti-inflation stance , does not expect slowing growth to undercut the inflationary pressures that have built up in the eurozone as a result of higher food and energy prices .
" the fact that the pace of growth is likely to slow does not mean that this will be enough to counteract stability concerns , nor will it automatically balance out inflationary pressures , " the central bank said .
bundesbank chief axel weber is a member of the european central bank 's 21-head rate-setting council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank has taken measures to fight inflation in the eurozone last month the frankfurt-based ecb raised its benchmark refinancing rate by 25 percent basis points to 4.25 percent in a bid to ward off resurgent inflation .
" it 's the duty of monetary policy to prevent increased price risks from translating into a long-lasting higher inflation rate , " the bank said .
continuous growth in german economy ends the second-quarter drop in germany 's growth brought to an end a solid economic upswing in recent years , with the economy chalking up a growth rate last year of 2.5 percent .
adjusted for working days , the german economy grew by 1.7 percent year-on-year in the three months to the end of june , based on last week 's statistics office data . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the pullout of peacekeeping forces started today , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovizyn told a daily official briefing .
" russia has finished the operation on halting georgia 's aggression against south ossetia . "
nogovitsyn also said , however , there had been a misunderstanding about president dmitry medvedev 's promise to his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy about whether russia would fully withdraw its forces from the caucasus republic .
" there is a distinction between the understandings of a ' pullback ' and a ' withdrawal ' .

georgia disputes pullout report nogovizyn said the pullout included russian troops in gori , in central georgia .
reports said the withdrawal initially involved groups of between five and 10 armoured vehicles .
they were seen heading toward the roki tunnel , which connects russia and georgia in the caucasus mountain region of south ossetia .
however , comments from us and russian leaders indicate that moscow may not , in fact , be leaving the area any time soon .
georgian deputy foreign minister giga bokeria said that russian forces appeared bent on inflicting as much damage as possible on the georgian economy .

18 , but warned inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched . despite fears that germany could be edging towards a sharp downturn , the bundesbank 's august bulletin did not see the nation 's economy spiraling downwards in the coming months .
but it said the nation was facing " an economic lean period during the second half of the year . "
the bundesbank bulletin expressed concerns that inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched in germany and among its partners in the 15-member eurozone and that slowing growth was unlikely to dampen price pressures .
" despite general caution in estimating the growth outlook for the euro zone , inflation expectations of market participants , according to surveys and financial market data , have been higher of late than can be reconciled with price stability over the long run , " the bundesbank said .
shrink in economy wo n't dampen fears : bundesbank data released last week by germany 's statistics office showed the economy shrank for the first time in almost four years during the second quarter , contracting by 0.5 percent on the quarter .
but the bundesbank said the second-quarter contraction was a reaction to the solid growth rate germany clocked up during the first three months of the year when the economy grew by 1.3 percent .
the bundesbank , which takes a hardline anti-inflation stance , does not expect slowing growth to undercut the inflationary pressures that have built up in the eurozone as a result of higher food and energy prices .
" the fact that the pace of growth is likely to slow does not mean that this will be enough to counteract stability concerns , nor will it automatically balance out inflationary pressures , " the central bank said .
bundesbank chief axel weber is a member of the european central bank 's 21-head rate-setting council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank has taken measures to fight inflation in the eurozone last month the frankfurt-based ecb raised its benchmark refinancing rate by 25 percent basis points to 4.25 percent in a bid to ward off resurgent inflation .
" it 's the duty of monetary policy to prevent increased price risks from translating into a long-lasting higher inflation rate , " the bank said .
continuous growth in german economy ends the second-quarter drop in germany 's growth brought to an end a solid economic upswing in recent years , with the economy chalking up a growth rate last year of 2.5 percent .
adjusted for working days , the german economy grew by 1.7 percent year-on-year in the three months to the end of june , based on last week 's statistics office data . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but other afflictions keep them from being able to show the same physical results as their younger people , german scientists found . a team led by janina boyke , from the department of systems neuroscience at the university of hamburg , undertook a test project to teach 69 healthy german men and women between the ages of 50 and 67 to juggle . in this case , juggling involved keeping three balls in motion for a minimum of 60 seconds , which can also sometimes be a challenge for young and agile minds and bodies . none of the test subjects had ever attempted to juggle before in their lives .
while none of them learned to juggle with any great proficiency , brain scans showed that they had learned a new skill and that their brains had structurally registered the new learning . learning-induced structural changes in the human brain were previously measured in young adults using high-resolution , three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry , which allows for the mapping of sections of the brain . boyke and her colleagues extended this research to show that such structural changes also occur in older adults . use it or lose it - at all ages as in the previous study , subjects were scanned three times : before learning to juggle , after three months of juggling and after three additional months following the cessation of the juggling instruction . although the older adults did not learn to juggle as well as younger adults , those who did learn showed similar increases in grey matter in the visual motion area of their brains . unlike young adults , older subject who learned to juggle had increased grey matter in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens compared to the control group . as in young adults , these grey-matter changes were transient , returning to baseline after three months without practice .
the results indicate that human brains retain some structural plasticity as they age , scientists said . the authors said the findings indicate older brains can retain the youthful ability to learn new skills . however , they caution that age-linked limitations such as poorer hand-eye coordination and neural function could impede the process as people age . in your 60s , you may not be able to become a first-rate professional juggler .
but it will not be because of limitations in your brain , but because you may have arthritis and need trifocals . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while none of them learned to juggle with any great proficiency , brain scans showed that they had learned a new skill and that their brains had structurally registered the new learning . learning-induced structural changes in the human brain were previously measured in young adults using high-resolution , three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry , which allows for the mapping of sections of the brain . boyke and her colleagues extended this research to show that such structural changes also occur in older adults . use it or lose it - at all ages as in the previous study , subjects were scanned three times : before learning to juggle , after three months of juggling and after three additional months following the cessation of the juggling instruction . although the older adults did not learn to juggle as well as younger adults , those who did learn showed similar increases in grey matter in the visual motion area of their brains . unlike young adults , older subject who learned to juggle had increased grey matter in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens compared to the control group . as in young adults , these grey-matter changes were transient , returning to baseline after three months without practice .
the results indicate that human brains retain some structural plasticity as they age , scientists said . the authors said the findings indicate older brains can retain the youthful ability to learn new skills . however , they caution that age-linked limitations such as poorer hand-eye coordination and neural function could impede the process as people age . in your 60s , you may not be able to become a first-rate professional juggler .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 18.08.2008 bundesbank warns of inflation risks despite slower growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesbank president axel weber and the ecb are fighting inflation germany 's central bank ruled out a dramatic slump in europe 's biggest economy in its monthly report released monday , aug .
18 , but warned inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched . despite fears that germany could be edging towards a sharp downturn , the bundesbank 's august bulletin did not see the nation 's economy spiraling downwards in the coming months .
but it said the nation was facing " an economic lean period during the second half of the year . "
the bundesbank bulletin expressed concerns that inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched in germany and among its partners in the 15-member eurozone and that slowing growth was unlikely to dampen price pressures .
" despite general caution in estimating the growth outlook for the euro zone , inflation expectations of market participants , according to surveys and financial market data , have been higher of late than can be reconciled with price stability over the long run , " the bundesbank said .
shrink in economy wo n't dampen fears : bundesbank data released last week by germany 's statistics office showed the economy shrank for the first time in almost four years during the second quarter , contracting by 0.5 percent on the quarter .
but the bundesbank said the second-quarter contraction was a reaction to the solid growth rate germany clocked up during the first three months of the year when the economy grew by 1.3 percent .
the bundesbank , which takes a hardline anti-inflation stance , does not expect slowing growth to undercut the inflationary pressures that have built up in the eurozone as a result of higher food and energy prices .
" the fact that the pace of growth is likely to slow does not mean that this will be enough to counteract stability concerns , nor will it automatically balance out inflationary pressures , " the central bank said .
bundesbank chief axel weber is a member of the european central bank 's 21-head rate-setting council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank has taken measures to fight inflation in the eurozone last month the frankfurt-based ecb raised its benchmark refinancing rate by 25 percent basis points to 4.25 percent in a bid to ward off resurgent inflation .
" it 's the duty of monetary policy to prevent increased price risks from translating into a long-lasting higher inflation rate , " the bank said .
continuous growth in german economy ends the second-quarter drop in germany 's growth brought to an end a solid economic upswing in recent years , with the economy chalking up a growth rate last year of 2.5 percent .
adjusted for working days , the german economy grew by 1.7 percent year-on-year in the three months to the end of june , based on last week 's statistics office data . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia announced the start of a pullback from georgia on monday , but georgia said it had seen no signs of russian forces withdrawing .
if anything , the foreign ministry said they were broadening their presence . russia 's military announced the start of the departure of russian forces from georgia on monday , august 18 .
" the pullout of peacekeeping forces started today , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovizyn told a daily official briefing .
" russia has finished the operation on halting georgia 's aggression against south ossetia . "
nogovitsyn also said , however , there had been a misunderstanding about president dmitry medvedev 's promise to his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy about whether russia would fully withdraw its forces from the caucasus republic .
" there is a distinction between the understandings of a ' pullback ' and a ' withdrawal ' .
in the conversation with french president sarkozy , the discussion was about an pullback of forces , not a withdrawal , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgians have been displaced in the fighting russian forces will pull back to the borders of south ossetia , the moscow-backed separatist region of georgia at the center of the conflict , nogovitsyn added .
he declined to answer a question about how many russian troops would remain in georgia , saying : " i am not ready to name any figures . "
georgia disputes pullout report nogovizyn said the pullout included russian troops in gori , in central georgia .
reports said the withdrawal initially involved groups of between five and 10 armoured vehicles .
they were seen heading toward the roki tunnel , which connects russia and georgia in the caucasus mountain region of south ossetia .
however , comments from us and russian leaders indicate that moscow may not , in fact , be leaving the area any time soon .
georgian deputy foreign minister giga bokeria said that russian forces appeared bent on inflicting as much damage as possible on the georgian economy .
" there are no signs at all that russian forces are pulling out , " he told reuters .
" quite the opposite .
they are spreading out to other regions . "
he gave no details .
a top georgian official also said russian forces are actually heading deeper into georgian territory from the central city of khashuri , despite the pull-out pledge , the afp news service reported .
reports of munitions destruction and georgia interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili said those russian forces that did appear to be pulling out were leaving a trail of destroyed munitions in their wake .
the russians were blowing up stores of georgian ammunition and weaponry at a base near the western town of senaki ahead of a planned withdrawal from georgia , utiashvili said .
he also said moscow 's troops had destroyed the runway at the base .
" they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places , " he said .
" if they call this a pullout , then i do not understand the meaning of the word . "
missile launchers said moved into region moreover , the russian military has been moving launchers for short-range ballistic missiles into the disputed caucuses region , american officials told the international herald tribune newspaper .
the step appears intended to tighten moscow 's hold on the breakaway territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has vowed to crush opponents the russian military deployed several ss-21 missile launchers and supply vehicles to south ossetia on friday , according to american officials familiar with intelligence reports .
from the new launching positions north of tskhinvali , the south ossetian capital , the missiles can reach much of georgia , including tbilisi , the capital .
cnn news web site reported that the head of the russian parliament 's foreign affairs committee , konstantin kosachev , said moscow would completely withdraw only when it was " assured that georgians would not continue to use military force " in the breakaway regions .
moscow to leave ' sooner or later , ' official says russian troops will leave " sooner or later , " kosachev said , saying the timetable depends " definitely on how georgians will continue to behave . "
" if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq , for example , the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there , " kosachev told cnn .
" the same answer would be toward this situation . "
russian president dmitry medvedev initially sent forces into georgia in support of pro-moscow separatists there on august 8 .
since , then , pressure has been mounting on russia to pull its troops out of the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow and tbilisi signed a ceasefire agreement late last week aimed at putting an end to the week-long conflict , and set the date for the pull-out .
but moscow 's tone has remained belligerent .
medvedev promises ' crushing response ' speaking to a group of world war ii veterans on monday , medvedev warned against any further georgian action .
" if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished , we will never allow this .
if anyone tries this again , we will come out with a crushing response , " medvedev told his audience in the russian city of kursk .
" we have all the necessary resources , political , economic and military .
if anyone had any illusions about this , they have to abandon them , " medvedev said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in early july , a similar poll found 53 percent of poles opposed the missile shield , part of a planned pentagon system that also includes a tracking radar in czech republic , which was agreed in july .
parliamentary approval is still required in both countries .
the latest survey was based on interviews of 500 people by pollster gfk polonia .
the margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
us-russia relations simmer over shield the us says the system , designed to destroy incoming ballistic missiles , is intended to defend against growing threats from so-called rogue states such as iran and north korea .
russia , however , vehemently opposes the shield , insisting it is aimed at containing moscow 's arsenal of strategic nuclear missiles - a charge the us denies .
rice will travel to moscow after a us-requested emergency meeting of nato nations in brussels to discuss the alliance 's reaction to the recent conflict in the caucasus .
the us-poland deal " is an important step in our efforts to protect the united states and our european allies from the growing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack said sunday . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , but warned inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched . despite fears that germany could be edging towards a sharp downturn , the bundesbank 's august bulletin did not see the nation 's economy spiraling downwards in the coming months .
but it said the nation was facing " an economic lean period during the second half of the year . "
the bundesbank bulletin expressed concerns that inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched in germany and among its partners in the 15-member eurozone and that slowing growth was unlikely to dampen price pressures .
" despite general caution in estimating the growth outlook for the euro zone , inflation expectations of market participants , according to surveys and financial market data , have been higher of late than can be reconciled with price stability over the long run , " the bundesbank said .
shrink in economy wo n't dampen fears : bundesbank data released last week by germany 's statistics office showed the economy shrank for the first time in almost four years during the second quarter , contracting by 0.5 percent on the quarter .
but the bundesbank said the second-quarter contraction was a reaction to the solid growth rate germany clocked up during the first three months of the year when the economy grew by 1.3 percent .
the bundesbank , which takes a hardline anti-inflation stance , does not expect slowing growth to undercut the inflationary pressures that have built up in the eurozone as a result of higher food and energy prices .
" the fact that the pace of growth is likely to slow does not mean that this will be enough to counteract stability concerns , nor will it automatically balance out inflationary pressures , " the central bank said .
bundesbank chief axel weber is a member of the european central bank 's 21-head rate-setting council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank has taken measures to fight inflation in the eurozone last month the frankfurt-based ecb raised its benchmark refinancing rate by 25 percent basis points to 4.25 percent in a bid to ward off resurgent inflation .
" it 's the duty of monetary policy to prevent increased price risks from translating into a long-lasting higher inflation rate , " the bank said .
continuous growth in german economy ends the second-quarter drop in germany 's growth brought to an end a solid economic upswing in recent years , with the economy chalking up a growth rate last year of 2.5 percent .

18 , but warned inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched . despite fears that germany could be edging towards a sharp downturn , the bundesbank 's august bulletin did not see the nation 's economy spiraling downwards in the coming months .
but it said the nation was facing " an economic lean period during the second half of the year . "
the bundesbank bulletin expressed concerns that inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched in germany and among its partners in the 15-member eurozone and that slowing growth was unlikely to dampen price pressures .
" despite general caution in estimating the growth outlook for the euro zone , inflation expectations of market participants , according to surveys and financial market data , have been higher of late than can be reconciled with price stability over the long run , " the bundesbank said .
shrink in economy wo n't dampen fears : bundesbank data released last week by germany 's statistics office showed the economy shrank for the first time in almost four years during the second quarter , contracting by 0.5 percent on the quarter .
but the bundesbank said the second-quarter contraction was a reaction to the solid growth rate germany clocked up during the first three months of the year when the economy grew by 1.3 percent .
the bundesbank , which takes a hardline anti-inflation stance , does not expect slowing growth to undercut the inflationary pressures that have built up in the eurozone as a result of higher food and energy prices .
" the fact that the pace of growth is likely to slow does not mean that this will be enough to counteract stability concerns , nor will it automatically balance out inflationary pressures , " the central bank said .
bundesbank chief axel weber is a member of the european central bank 's 21-head rate-setting council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank has taken measures to fight inflation in the eurozone last month the frankfurt-based ecb raised its benchmark refinancing rate by 25 percent basis points to 4.25 percent in a bid to ward off resurgent inflation .
" it 's the duty of monetary policy to prevent increased price risks from translating into a long-lasting higher inflation rate , " the bank said .
continuous growth in german economy ends the second-quarter drop in germany 's growth brought to an end a solid economic upswing in recent years , with the economy chalking up a growth rate last year of 2.5 percent .

but the german development ministry have denied his claims . bonde told the german news magazine der spiegel that of the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million -rrb- that the germany 's development ministry -lrb- bmz -rrb- allocated for rebuilding projects in afghanistan in 2007 , 20 million euros was never spent .
he said that the slow pace of the aid contradicts the government 's claims that civilian reconstruction remains its top priority in afghanistan .
it is a problem that could be set to continue this year .
the ministry had only spent a third of its reconstruction budget in the first six months of 2008 .
bonde blames german bureaucratic hurdles for the delay .
ministry denies slowdown bildunterschrift : some feel reconstruction has been too slow the development ministry denied bonde 's accusations , calling them " unjustifiable and false , " according to the dpa news agency .
the ministry spokesman said that half of the money earmarked for afghanistan is part of long-term authorizations .
germany 's long-term commitments in afghanistan are transferred over the course of several years because most of the programs take place over a three or seven-year duration , the ministry said .
bonde said he was n't satisfied with this answer .
" my criticism is based on official numbers from the foreign ministry , " he said .
" as long as the bmz does n't provide other concrete numbers , the denial has no value , " he said in a written response reported by the dpa news agency .
he called for a clarification from the government on what money has actually been spent .
sensitive to criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany helps train afghanistan 's security forces germany 's left-right coalition government has come under repeated criticism for putting military aid ahead of humanitarian help .

civilian aid remained the focus of german help to kabul , steinmeier said .
unpopular mission yet even as germany 's top politicians emphasize humanitarian aid , the government has been pushing for an increase in the number of peacekeeping troops .
germany 's participation in the isaf mission is unpopular at home .
but , the government has said that it needs more troops to improve security in afghanistan , which is currently experiencing an upsurge in violence orchestrated by the taliban .

18 . moscow 's plan to retain russian peacekeepers in the embattled caucasus provinces sparked new tension in russia 's relations with the european union and united states . german chancellor angela merkel assured saakashvili in tbilisi that nato remained ready to give membership to the ex-soviet republic , as promised at a nato summit in april , despite the conflict with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a visit , merkel offered saakashvili support " georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to - and it does want to , " merkel said on sunday . us secretary of state condoleezza rice accused russia of acting in bad faith in the past .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says a pullout is " non-negotiable " however , new tensions gathered over russia 's longer-term military plans in the small but strategically located ex-soviet republic .
russia plans to deploy a peacekeeping force of unspecified size that georgian officials worry could turn into an open-ended occupation . " there is no such notion any more in georgia as russian peacekeepers , " saakashvili said at a press conference with merkel .
" there can be no russian peacekeepers - these are just russian forces . " meanwhile , the leader of the breakaway region at the heart of the georgia-russia conflict said on monday he would ask moscow to station a military base in south ossetia . on sunday , south ossetian president eduard kokoity dismissed his government and proclaimed a state of emergency in the rebel region , russia 's vesti-24 television reported .
south ossetia leader opposes osce observers asked in a separate interview with reuters news service if he would like a permanent russian base in the region , kokoity said : " we will ask the leadership of the russian federation for there to be a russian military base on the territory of south ossetia because russian citizens live here . "
international organizations such as the organization for security and cooperation in europe have offered to send observers to the region .
but kokoity , sometimes using emotional language , said he would not accept international observers in his region again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian soldiers are still in georgia russian troops on monday were still holding positions about 35 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- north of tbilisi , and near the georgian cities of poti and senaki on the black sea coast . rice : russia 's reputation ' in tatters ' the georgian government has accused the russians of acting in bad faith in the past , given a mere three kilometer retreat on thursday . rice meanwhile pressured russia to live up to its promises under the eu-brokered ceasefire . " russia overreached , used disproportionate force against a small neighbor and is now paying the price , " rice told nbc television 's meet the press .
" russia 's reputation as a potential partner in international institutions , diplomatic , political , security , economic , is frankly , in tatters . " reports of russian soldiers leaving georgia the ceasefire deal is meant to conclude a five-day conflict in which russian forces drove off a georgian army assault overnight on aug .
7 against moscow-backed separatists in the breakaway region of south ossetia . in gori , a russian-occupied town beyond south ossetia , the commanding general said a switch from regular troops had already begun .

but other afflictions keep them from being able to show the same physical results as their younger people , german scientists found . a team led by janina boyke , from the department of systems neuroscience at the university of hamburg , undertook a test project to teach 69 healthy german men and women between the ages of 50 and 67 to juggle . in this case , juggling involved keeping three balls in motion for a minimum of 60 seconds , which can also sometimes be a challenge for young and agile minds and bodies . none of the test subjects had ever attempted to juggle before in their lives .
while none of them learned to juggle with any great proficiency , brain scans showed that they had learned a new skill and that their brains had structurally registered the new learning . learning-induced structural changes in the human brain were previously measured in young adults using high-resolution , three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry , which allows for the mapping of sections of the brain . boyke and her colleagues extended this research to show that such structural changes also occur in older adults . use it or lose it - at all ages as in the previous study , subjects were scanned three times : before learning to juggle , after three months of juggling and after three additional months following the cessation of the juggling instruction . although the older adults did not learn to juggle as well as younger adults , those who did learn showed similar increases in grey matter in the visual motion area of their brains . unlike young adults , older subject who learned to juggle had increased grey matter in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens compared to the control group . as in young adults , these grey-matter changes were transient , returning to baseline after three months without practice .
the results indicate that human brains retain some structural plasticity as they age , scientists said . the authors said the findings indicate older brains can retain the youthful ability to learn new skills . however , they caution that age-linked limitations such as poorer hand-eye coordination and neural function could impede the process as people age . in your 60s , you may not be able to become a first-rate professional juggler .

" more and more the sentiment is that the former chancellor has an imbalanced relationship from his previous position , " christian social union foreign policy spokesman karl-theodor zu guttenberg told the passauer neuen presse on monday , aug .
18 .
" each of his declarations is an affront to foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " gazprom connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder heads nord stream project , which is heavily connected to gazprom schroeder 's critics have said such derision may have also been catalyzed by the fact that the former chancellor has firm connections with russian energy giant gazprom . schroeder currently chairs the nord stream consortium , an energy concern overseeing a planned natural gas pipeline from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
the pipeline would bypass countries such as poland and lithuania , thus depriving them of tax revenue . gazprom is a major player in nord stream , of which schroeder was a major proponent while still in office .
he initialed the go-ahead for the baltic project , along with then russian president vladimir putin , in september 2005 , only weeks before the end of his tenure as chancellor . eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the christian democratic union parliamentary party faction , touched on this in his criticism of the former chancellor . " the recriminations were predictable , " he told 24-hour news channel n-tv on monday .
" schroeder is the prominent voice of moscow in germany . " the free-market liberal fpd party secretary general dirk niebel told the station he thought schroeder was willing to do anything his employer asked . " -lsb- schroeder 's -rsb- one-sided attribution of blame is in line with the motto : he who pays the piper calls the tune , " niebel said . reoccurring controversy tracking back to 2005 , a mere two weeks after he left office , whispers of corruption surfaced after it became apparent schroeder may sign on with gazprom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us military flew 2,000 georgian troops home from iraq after georgia recalled them editorialists at several german newspapers as well as politicians of germany 's political parties were highly critical of his planned involvement with nord stream . schroeder , however , continues to insist the eu press ahead with forming a " strategic partnership " with russia , saying europe risked losing influence and pushing moscow towards china if it did not work with the kremlin . other european politicians , particularly in capitals of former soviet satellite nations , have called for a re-evaluation of european-russian ties . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , but warned inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched . despite fears that germany could be edging towards a sharp downturn , the bundesbank 's august bulletin did not see the nation 's economy spiraling downwards in the coming months .
but it said the nation was facing " an economic lean period during the second half of the year . "
the bundesbank bulletin expressed concerns that inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched in germany and among its partners in the 15-member eurozone and that slowing growth was unlikely to dampen price pressures .
" despite general caution in estimating the growth outlook for the euro zone , inflation expectations of market participants , according to surveys and financial market data , have been higher of late than can be reconciled with price stability over the long run , " the bundesbank said .
shrink in economy wo n't dampen fears : bundesbank data released last week by germany 's statistics office showed the economy shrank for the first time in almost four years during the second quarter , contracting by 0.5 percent on the quarter .
but the bundesbank said the second-quarter contraction was a reaction to the solid growth rate germany clocked up during the first three months of the year when the economy grew by 1.3 percent .
the bundesbank , which takes a hardline anti-inflation stance , does not expect slowing growth to undercut the inflationary pressures that have built up in the eurozone as a result of higher food and energy prices .
" the fact that the pace of growth is likely to slow does not mean that this will be enough to counteract stability concerns , nor will it automatically balance out inflationary pressures , " the central bank said .
bundesbank chief axel weber is a member of the european central bank 's 21-head rate-setting council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank has taken measures to fight inflation in the eurozone last month the frankfurt-based ecb raised its benchmark refinancing rate by 25 percent basis points to 4.25 percent in a bid to ward off resurgent inflation .
" it 's the duty of monetary policy to prevent increased price risks from translating into a long-lasting higher inflation rate , " the bank said .
continuous growth in german economy ends the second-quarter drop in germany 's growth brought to an end a solid economic upswing in recent years , with the economy chalking up a growth rate last year of 2.5 percent .

but the german development ministry have denied his claims . bonde told the german news magazine der spiegel that of the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million -rrb- that the germany 's development ministry -lrb- bmz -rrb- allocated for rebuilding projects in afghanistan in 2007 , 20 million euros was never spent .
he said that the slow pace of the aid contradicts the government 's claims that civilian reconstruction remains its top priority in afghanistan .
it is a problem that could be set to continue this year .
the ministry had only spent a third of its reconstruction budget in the first six months of 2008 .
bonde blames german bureaucratic hurdles for the delay .
ministry denies slowdown bildunterschrift : some feel reconstruction has been too slow the development ministry denied bonde 's accusations , calling them " unjustifiable and false , " according to the dpa news agency .
the ministry spokesman said that half of the money earmarked for afghanistan is part of long-term authorizations .
germany 's long-term commitments in afghanistan are transferred over the course of several years because most of the programs take place over a three or seven-year duration , the ministry said .
bonde said he was n't satisfied with this answer .
" my criticism is based on official numbers from the foreign ministry , " he said .
" as long as the bmz does n't provide other concrete numbers , the denial has no value , " he said in a written response reported by the dpa news agency .
he called for a clarification from the government on what money has actually been spent .
sensitive to criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany helps train afghanistan 's security forces germany 's left-right coalition government has come under repeated criticism for putting military aid ahead of humanitarian help .
germany has about 3,500 troops taking part in a nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
german police officers are also involved in training afghan security forces .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited afghanistan in july and emphasized germany 's involvement new roads and schools .
civilian aid remained the focus of german help to kabul , steinmeier said .
unpopular mission yet even as germany 's top politicians emphasize humanitarian aid , the government has been pushing for an increase in the number of peacekeeping troops .
germany 's participation in the isaf mission is unpopular at home .
but , the government has said that it needs more troops to improve security in afghanistan , which is currently experiencing an upsurge in violence orchestrated by the taliban .
berlin has proposed further increasing the number of troops to 4,500 . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , that 24.9 percent of its newly formed subsidiary db mobility logistics , which is now home to db 's passenger and logistics operations , would be listed on the stock market in the coming months . analysts have said the planned partial privatization of europe 's biggest rail group should generate about 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.8 billion -rrb- , with db having launched a drive for international investors to buy into the share listing . db said the group 's earnings before interest , tax and special items rose 6.8 percent to 1.4 billion euros during the first half of the year with net profit increasing by 5.4 percent to 915 million euros . " never before have so many people in germany traveled on db trains in the first half -lrb- of the year -rrb- , and never before were more goods transported by rail , " said mehdorn . the rail company said revenue jumped by 8.2 percent to 16.6 billion euros in the six months to the end of june compared to the same period last year . passenger traffic increased by 3 percent to a record 941 million , which corresponds on average to about 5.2 million people travelling on db 's trains each day . db 's higher figures may in some part also be attributed to its increasing of commuter and main-line fares by 2.9 percent last september . the volume of db 's goods traffic rose 26.3 percent to 197 million tons . under the group 's sell-off plan , the state would have a 75.1-percent stake of db 's passenger and freight operations .
however , the partial privatization means that berlin would retain 100 percent control of the rail company 's railway stations as well as its 34,000 kilometers -lrb- 21,748 miles -rrb- of track network and its energy supplier operations . the bahn also announced monday it would be increasing fares in december .
increases in fuel and personnel costs forced the company to raise ticket prices , mehdorn said . the rail company said it would specify the exact amount of the increase in september .

18 , but warned inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched . despite fears that germany could be edging towards a sharp downturn , the bundesbank 's august bulletin did not see the nation 's economy spiraling downwards in the coming months .
but it said the nation was facing " an economic lean period during the second half of the year . "
the bundesbank bulletin expressed concerns that inflationary expectations were becoming entrenched in germany and among its partners in the 15-member eurozone and that slowing growth was unlikely to dampen price pressures .
" despite general caution in estimating the growth outlook for the euro zone , inflation expectations of market participants , according to surveys and financial market data , have been higher of late than can be reconciled with price stability over the long run , " the bundesbank said .
shrink in economy wo n't dampen fears : bundesbank data released last week by germany 's statistics office showed the economy shrank for the first time in almost four years during the second quarter , contracting by 0.5 percent on the quarter .
but the bundesbank said the second-quarter contraction was a reaction to the solid growth rate germany clocked up during the first three months of the year when the economy grew by 1.3 percent .
the bundesbank , which takes a hardline anti-inflation stance , does not expect slowing growth to undercut the inflationary pressures that have built up in the eurozone as a result of higher food and energy prices .
" the fact that the pace of growth is likely to slow does not mean that this will be enough to counteract stability concerns , nor will it automatically balance out inflationary pressures , " the central bank said .
bundesbank chief axel weber is a member of the european central bank 's 21-head rate-setting council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank has taken measures to fight inflation in the eurozone last month the frankfurt-based ecb raised its benchmark refinancing rate by 25 percent basis points to 4.25 percent in a bid to ward off resurgent inflation .
" it 's the duty of monetary policy to prevent increased price risks from translating into a long-lasting higher inflation rate , " the bank said .
continuous growth in german economy ends the second-quarter drop in germany 's growth brought to an end a solid economic upswing in recent years , with the economy chalking up a growth rate last year of 2.5 percent .
adjusted for working days , the german economy grew by 1.7 percent year-on-year in the three months to the end of june , based on last week 's statistics office data . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia announced the start of a pullback from georgia on monday , but georgia said it had seen no signs of russian forces withdrawing .
if anything , the foreign ministry said they were broadening their presence . russia 's military announced the start of the departure of russian forces from georgia on monday , august 18 .
" the pullout of peacekeeping forces started today , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovizyn told a daily official briefing .
" russia has finished the operation on halting georgia 's aggression against south ossetia . "
nogovitsyn also said , however , there had been a misunderstanding about president dmitry medvedev 's promise to his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy about whether russia would fully withdraw its forces from the caucasus republic .
" there is a distinction between the understandings of a ' pullback ' and a ' withdrawal ' .
in the conversation with french president sarkozy , the discussion was about an pullback of forces , not a withdrawal , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgians have been displaced in the fighting russian forces will pull back to the borders of south ossetia , the moscow-backed separatist region of georgia at the center of the conflict , nogovitsyn added .
he declined to answer a question about how many russian troops would remain in georgia , saying : " i am not ready to name any figures . "
georgia disputes pullout report nogovizyn said the pullout included russian troops in gori , in central georgia .
reports said the withdrawal initially involved groups of between five and 10 armoured vehicles .
they were seen heading toward the roki tunnel , which connects russia and georgia in the caucasus mountain region of south ossetia .
however , comments from us and russian leaders indicate that moscow may not , in fact , be leaving the area any time soon .
georgian deputy foreign minister giga bokeria said that russian forces appeared bent on inflicting as much damage as possible on the georgian economy .
" there are no signs at all that russian forces are pulling out , " he told reuters .
" quite the opposite .
they are spreading out to other regions . "
he gave no details .
a top georgian official also said russian forces are actually heading deeper into georgian territory from the central city of khashuri , despite the pull-out pledge , the afp news service reported .
reports of munitions destruction and georgia interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili said those russian forces that did appear to be pulling out were leaving a trail of destroyed munitions in their wake .
the russians were blowing up stores of georgian ammunition and weaponry at a base near the western town of senaki ahead of a planned withdrawal from georgia , utiashvili said .
he also said moscow 's troops had destroyed the runway at the base .
" they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places , " he said .
" if they call this a pullout , then i do not understand the meaning of the word . "
missile launchers said moved into region moreover , the russian military has been moving launchers for short-range ballistic missiles into the disputed caucuses region , american officials told the international herald tribune newspaper .
the step appears intended to tighten moscow 's hold on the breakaway territory .

from the new launching positions north of tskhinvali , the south ossetian capital , the missiles can reach much of georgia , including tbilisi , the capital .
cnn news web site reported that the head of the russian parliament 's foreign affairs committee , konstantin kosachev , said moscow would completely withdraw only when it was " assured that georgians would not continue to use military force " in the breakaway regions .
moscow to leave ' sooner or later , ' official says russian troops will leave " sooner or later , " kosachev said , saying the timetable depends " definitely on how georgians will continue to behave . "
" if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq , for example , the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there , " kosachev told cnn .
" the same answer would be toward this situation . "
russian president dmitry medvedev initially sent forces into georgia in support of pro-moscow separatists there on august 8 .
since , then , pressure has been mounting on russia to pull its troops out of the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow and tbilisi signed a ceasefire agreement late last week aimed at putting an end to the week-long conflict , and set the date for the pull-out .
but moscow 's tone has remained belligerent .

russia announced the start of a pullback from georgia on monday , but georgia said it had seen no signs of russian forces withdrawing .
if anything , the foreign ministry said they were broadening their presence . russia 's military announced the start of the departure of russian forces from georgia on monday , august 18 .
" the pullout of peacekeeping forces started today , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovizyn told a daily official briefing .
" russia has finished the operation on halting georgia 's aggression against south ossetia . "
nogovitsyn also said , however , there had been a misunderstanding about president dmitry medvedev 's promise to his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy about whether russia would fully withdraw its forces from the caucasus republic .
" there is a distinction between the understandings of a ' pullback ' and a ' withdrawal ' .

he declined to answer a question about how many russian troops would remain in georgia , saying : " i am not ready to name any figures . "
georgia disputes pullout report nogovizyn said the pullout included russian troops in gori , in central georgia .
reports said the withdrawal initially involved groups of between five and 10 armoured vehicles .
they were seen heading toward the roki tunnel , which connects russia and georgia in the caucasus mountain region of south ossetia .
however , comments from us and russian leaders indicate that moscow may not , in fact , be leaving the area any time soon .
georgian deputy foreign minister giga bokeria said that russian forces appeared bent on inflicting as much damage as possible on the georgian economy .
" there are no signs at all that russian forces are pulling out , " he told reuters .
" quite the opposite .
they are spreading out to other regions . "
he gave no details .
a top georgian official also said russian forces are actually heading deeper into georgian territory from the central city of khashuri , despite the pull-out pledge , the afp news service reported .
reports of munitions destruction and georgia interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili said those russian forces that did appear to be pulling out were leaving a trail of destroyed munitions in their wake .
the russians were blowing up stores of georgian ammunition and weaponry at a base near the western town of senaki ahead of a planned withdrawal from georgia , utiashvili said .
he also said moscow 's troops had destroyed the runway at the base .
" they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places , " he said .
" if they call this a pullout , then i do not understand the meaning of the word . "

" there is a distinction between the understandings of a ' pullback ' and a ' withdrawal ' .

russia announced the start of a pullback from georgia on monday , but georgia said it had seen no signs of russian forces withdrawing .
if anything , the foreign ministry said they were broadening their presence . russia 's military announced the start of the departure of russian forces from georgia on monday , august 18 .
" the pullout of peacekeeping forces started today , " deputy chief of staff anatoly nogovizyn told a daily official briefing .
" russia has finished the operation on halting georgia 's aggression against south ossetia . "
nogovitsyn also said , however , there had been a misunderstanding about president dmitry medvedev 's promise to his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy about whether russia would fully withdraw its forces from the caucasus republic .
" there is a distinction between the understandings of a ' pullback ' and a ' withdrawal ' .
in the conversation with french president sarkozy , the discussion was about an pullback of forces , not a withdrawal , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgians have been displaced in the fighting russian forces will pull back to the borders of south ossetia , the moscow-backed separatist region of georgia at the center of the conflict , nogovitsyn added .
he declined to answer a question about how many russian troops would remain in georgia , saying : " i am not ready to name any figures . "
georgia disputes pullout report nogovizyn said the pullout included russian troops in gori , in central georgia .
reports said the withdrawal initially involved groups of between five and 10 armoured vehicles .
they were seen heading toward the roki tunnel , which connects russia and georgia in the caucasus mountain region of south ossetia .
however , comments from us and russian leaders indicate that moscow may not , in fact , be leaving the area any time soon .
georgian deputy foreign minister giga bokeria said that russian forces appeared bent on inflicting as much damage as possible on the georgian economy .
" there are no signs at all that russian forces are pulling out , " he told reuters .
" quite the opposite .
they are spreading out to other regions . "
he gave no details .
a top georgian official also said russian forces are actually heading deeper into georgian territory from the central city of khashuri , despite the pull-out pledge , the afp news service reported .
reports of munitions destruction and georgia interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili said those russian forces that did appear to be pulling out were leaving a trail of destroyed munitions in their wake .
the russians were blowing up stores of georgian ammunition and weaponry at a base near the western town of senaki ahead of a planned withdrawal from georgia , utiashvili said .
he also said moscow 's troops had destroyed the runway at the base .
" they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places , " he said .
" if they call this a pullout , then i do not understand the meaning of the word . "
missile launchers said moved into region moreover , the russian military has been moving launchers for short-range ballistic missiles into the disputed caucuses region , american officials told the international herald tribune newspaper .
the step appears intended to tighten moscow 's hold on the breakaway territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has vowed to crush opponents the russian military deployed several ss-21 missile launchers and supply vehicles to south ossetia on friday , according to american officials familiar with intelligence reports .
from the new launching positions north of tskhinvali , the south ossetian capital , the missiles can reach much of georgia , including tbilisi , the capital .
cnn news web site reported that the head of the russian parliament 's foreign affairs committee , konstantin kosachev , said moscow would completely withdraw only when it was " assured that georgians would not continue to use military force " in the breakaway regions .
moscow to leave ' sooner or later , ' official says russian troops will leave " sooner or later , " kosachev said , saying the timetable depends " definitely on how georgians will continue to behave . "
" if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq , for example , the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there , " kosachev told cnn .
" the same answer would be toward this situation . "
russian president dmitry medvedev initially sent forces into georgia in support of pro-moscow separatists there on august 8 .
since , then , pressure has been mounting on russia to pull its troops out of the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow and tbilisi signed a ceasefire agreement late last week aimed at putting an end to the week-long conflict , and set the date for the pull-out .
but moscow 's tone has remained belligerent .
medvedev promises ' crushing response ' speaking to a group of world war ii veterans on monday , medvedev warned against any further georgian action .
" if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished , we will never allow this .
if anyone tries this again , we will come out with a crushing response , " medvedev told his audience in the russian city of kursk .
" we have all the necessary resources , political , economic and military .

" more and more the sentiment is that the former chancellor has an imbalanced relationship from his previous position , " christian social union foreign policy spokesman karl-theodor zu guttenberg told the passauer neuen presse on monday , aug .
18 .
" each of his declarations is an affront to foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " gazprom connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder heads nord stream project , which is heavily connected to gazprom schroeder 's critics have said such derision may have also been catalyzed by the fact that the former chancellor has firm connections with russian energy giant gazprom . schroeder currently chairs the nord stream consortium , an energy concern overseeing a planned natural gas pipeline from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
the pipeline would bypass countries such as poland and lithuania , thus depriving them of tax revenue . gazprom is a major player in nord stream , of which schroeder was a major proponent while still in office .
he initialed the go-ahead for the baltic project , along with then russian president vladimir putin , in september 2005 , only weeks before the end of his tenure as chancellor . eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the christian democratic union parliamentary party faction , touched on this in his criticism of the former chancellor . " the recriminations were predictable , " he told 24-hour news channel n-tv on monday .
" schroeder is the prominent voice of moscow in germany .

" there can be no russian peacekeepers - these are just russian forces . " meanwhile , the leader of the breakaway region at the heart of the georgia-russia conflict said on monday he would ask moscow to station a military base in south ossetia . on sunday , south ossetian president eduard kokoity dismissed his government and proclaimed a state of emergency in the rebel region , russia 's vesti-24 television reported .
south ossetia leader opposes osce observers asked in a separate interview with reuters news service if he would like a permanent russian base in the region , kokoity said : " we will ask the leadership of the russian federation for there to be a russian military base on the territory of south ossetia because russian citizens live here . "
international organizations such as the organization for security and cooperation in europe have offered to send observers to the region .
but kokoity , sometimes using emotional language , said he would not accept international observers in his region again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian soldiers are still in georgia russian troops on monday were still holding positions about 35 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- north of tbilisi , and near the georgian cities of poti and senaki on the black sea coast . rice : russia 's reputation ' in tatters ' the georgian government has accused the russians of acting in bad faith in the past , given a mere three kilometer retreat on thursday . rice meanwhile pressured russia to live up to its promises under the eu-brokered ceasefire .

watch andrew north 's reports we heard a squeal of tyres and jumped aside as a black car sped past us , slamming to a halt near the doors of a clinic .
the windows and bodywork were peppered with bullet holes .
a man leapt out shouting for help , and ran to the other side of the car .
medical workers struggled to lift out a large , barrel-chested man , with blood pouring from his back .
for a second , they had him upright .
then he collapsed .
somehow they got his bulk onto a gurney and into the clinic .
blood oozing from his own wounds , the first man burst back outside to talk to us , while staff were doing what they could for his friend .
" a minibus came and rammed us , " he said .
" gunmen opened fire from inside . "
he did not know who they were , as they did not have uniforms .
there had already been several reports of south ossetians attacking civilians in this area , around the town of gori .
this looked like a repeat .
wounded children it was five days into the fighting in south ossetia and georgia .
russian troops were supposed to control the area now .
see map of the region but we had driven in without seeing a single soldier .
no one seemed to be in charge .
inside the clinic , the man 's friend was still alive , but he would not survive if he stayed long .
it is just one small , tumbledown building , with barely any equipment or even light inside .
but this was now the only functioning medical facility in gori , after the georgian military had evacuated their big , modern hospital in the town centre that morning .

discontent since then , we have been told by medical sources that more than 100 georgian soldiers had been killed each day at the peak of the fighting - a very heavy toll for such a small army .

watch andrew north 's reports we heard a squeal of tyres and jumped aside as a black car sped past us , slamming to a halt near the doors of a clinic .
the windows and bodywork were peppered with bullet holes .
a man leapt out shouting for help , and ran to the other side of the car .
medical workers struggled to lift out a large , barrel-chested man , with blood pouring from his back .
for a second , they had him upright .
then he collapsed .
somehow they got his bulk onto a gurney and into the clinic .
blood oozing from his own wounds , the first man burst back outside to talk to us , while staff were doing what they could for his friend .
" a minibus came and rammed us , " he said .
" gunmen opened fire from inside . "
he did not know who they were , as they did not have uniforms .
there had already been several reports of south ossetians attacking civilians in this area , around the town of gori .
this looked like a repeat .
wounded children it was five days into the fighting in south ossetia and georgia .
russian troops were supposed to control the area now .
see map of the region but we had driven in without seeing a single soldier .
no one seemed to be in charge .
inside the clinic , the man 's friend was still alive , but he would not survive if he stayed long .
it is just one small , tumbledown building , with barely any equipment or even light inside .
tens of thousands of georgians have sought refuge in tbilisi but this was now the only functioning medical facility in gori , after the georgian military had evacuated their big , modern hospital in the town centre that morning .
instead , the clinic was serving as a kind of transport hub , patching people up as best they could and calling ambulances up from tbilisi .
the staff were overwhelmed .
the elderly doctor in charge said they had already had more than 30 casualties in that day , two of them children .

watch andrew north 's reports we heard a squeal of tyres and jumped aside as a black car sped past us , slamming to a halt near the doors of a clinic .
the windows and bodywork were peppered with bullet holes .
a man leapt out shouting for help , and ran to the other side of the car .
medical workers struggled to lift out a large , barrel-chested man , with blood pouring from his back .
for a second , they had him upright .
then he collapsed .
somehow they got his bulk onto a gurney and into the clinic .
blood oozing from his own wounds , the first man burst back outside to talk to us , while staff were doing what they could for his friend .
" a minibus came and rammed us , " he said .
" gunmen opened fire from inside . "
he did not know who they were , as they did not have uniforms .
there had already been several reports of south ossetians attacking civilians in this area , around the town of gori .
this looked like a repeat .
wounded children it was five days into the fighting in south ossetia and georgia .
russian troops were supposed to control the area now .
see map of the region but we had driven in without seeing a single soldier .
no one seemed to be in charge .
inside the clinic , the man 's friend was still alive , but he would not survive if he stayed long .
it is just one small , tumbledown building , with barely any equipment or even light inside .
tens of thousands of georgians have sought refuge in tbilisi but this was now the only functioning medical facility in gori , after the georgian military had evacuated their big , modern hospital in the town centre that morning .
instead , the clinic was serving as a kind of transport hub , patching people up as best they could and calling ambulances up from tbilisi .
the staff were overwhelmed .
the elderly doctor in charge said they had already had more than 30 casualties in that day , two of them children .
" we just have to cope , " she said .
" we ca n't worry about ourselves . "
incredibly , in the middle of all this , one of the staff insisted on making us coffee .
then two more children were brought in , with a screech of police car tyres .
their mother too , who arrived a few minutes later , was much more seriously injured .
she had taken five bullets as she had thrown herself over her children to protect them .
amazingly , she survived - we tracked down the mother later in the week .
heavy losses there were still other casualties out there .
one medical team had been trying to reach a village outside gori where several women and children had been hit by gunfire .
but they said russian troops had stopped them before they could get there .
they 've been dying before we could treat them georgian doctor everywhere we looked in the military hospital , things appeared to be at breaking point .
clusters of green and blue-clothed doctors and nurses sat outside , sitting on wheelchairs and trolleys , on walls and on the grass , hardly talking , smoking , staring straight ahead - exhausted and traumatised by the constant flow of injured .
but new wounded were being brought in every few minutes .
and going the other way , cars bearing crosses on their roofs , taking away the dead .
a group of orthodox priests waited at one door , ready for the next call to administer the last rites .
then we were taken to see the morgue .
the telltale smell hit us as we entered .
feet poked out of green military body bags .
they were on the floor and in the cabinets - 16 bodies i counted .
this was just from the first part of the day , staff said .
" they 've been dying before we could treat them , " one doctor told us later .
a senior doctor said the hospital had been handling an average of 350 casualties each day .
" why are so many people being sacrificed for someone 's impulsive behaviour ? " he said - a comment apparently aimed at his own leader .
discontent since then , we have been told by medical sources that more than 100 georgian soldiers had been killed each day at the peak of the fighting - a very heavy toll for such a small army .
gori has seen intense violence under russian occupation with no air cover , georgian troops were almost totally exposed to russian warplanes .
no-one has any clear idea of civilian casualties , but they may be even higher .
as the week progressed and the news got worse , we heard more and more georgians denouncing their government for getting into this unequal war .
they condemned russia even more , but many georgians feel their leaders should have seen what was coming .
when we fed one of our reports from a local tv station , workers there were stunned .
we are not seeing this in the georgian media , one said .
we are not getting the true story .
the continued russian advance to within 30km -lrb- 18.5 miles -rrb- of tbilisi has helped shore up president mikhail saakashvili .
this is no longer a time for open criticism .
people have been rallying around the government .
i watched two children putting up their homemade " stop russia " signs on a tbilisi backstreet over the weekend .
but one political analyst predicted : " in a few weeks , maybe a month or so , when things quieten down , there will be protests . "
surreal in the meantime , with russian forces still occupying large parts of georgia despite the ceasefire , the country remains in limbo with some areas in a state of near-anarchy .
tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in tbilisi , many living in abandoned buildings with little assistance .
much of georgia 's american-trained army is in disarray .
many troops have taken off their uniforms and returned home .
we came across several units who admitted they had no orders and did not know what to do .
but there are still georgian troops posted along the roads and highways , close to russian lines .
there is a surreal side to the situation too .
for all the recent carnage , things can seem strangely relaxed .
in tbilisi , it is hard to know there is a conflict going on .
some " stop russia " banners can be seen .
but there is no extra security on the streets .
shops are full of supplies and the power is still on .
on saturday i watched an elderly man clad in brightly coloured lycra cycling purposefully on a racing bike along the main road to gori out of tbilisi .
just 30km away , that road is blocked by russian troops .
and on the banks of the mtkvari river which meanders through the capital , the same groups of fishermen are there every day , with the worst crisis in europe since the balkan wars still going on .

watch andrew north 's reports we heard a squeal of tyres and jumped aside as a black car sped past us , slamming to a halt near the doors of a clinic .
the windows and bodywork were peppered with bullet holes .
a man leapt out shouting for help , and ran to the other side of the car .
medical workers struggled to lift out a large , barrel-chested man , with blood pouring from his back .
for a second , they had him upright .
then he collapsed .
somehow they got his bulk onto a gurney and into the clinic .
blood oozing from his own wounds , the first man burst back outside to talk to us , while staff were doing what they could for his friend .
" a minibus came and rammed us , " he said .
" gunmen opened fire from inside . "
he did not know who they were , as they did not have uniforms .
there had already been several reports of south ossetians attacking civilians in this area , around the town of gori .
this looked like a repeat .
wounded children it was five days into the fighting in south ossetia and georgia .
russian troops were supposed to control the area now .
see map of the region but we had driven in without seeing a single soldier .
no one seemed to be in charge .
inside the clinic , the man 's friend was still alive , but he would not survive if he stayed long .
it is just one small , tumbledown building , with barely any equipment or even light inside .
tens of thousands of georgians have sought refuge in tbilisi but this was now the only functioning medical facility in gori , after the georgian military had evacuated their big , modern hospital in the town centre that morning .
instead , the clinic was serving as a kind of transport hub , patching people up as best they could and calling ambulances up from tbilisi .
the staff were overwhelmed .
the elderly doctor in charge said they had already had more than 30 casualties in that day , two of them children .
" we just have to cope , " she said .
" we ca n't worry about ourselves . "
incredibly , in the middle of all this , one of the staff insisted on making us coffee .
then two more children were brought in , with a screech of police car tyres .
their mother too , who arrived a few minutes later , was much more seriously injured .
she had taken five bullets as she had thrown herself over her children to protect them .
amazingly , she survived - we tracked down the mother later in the week .
heavy losses there were still other casualties out there .
one medical team had been trying to reach a village outside gori where several women and children had been hit by gunfire .
but they said russian troops had stopped them before they could get there .
they 've been dying before we could treat them georgian doctor everywhere we looked in the military hospital , things appeared to be at breaking point .
clusters of green and blue-clothed doctors and nurses sat outside , sitting on wheelchairs and trolleys , on walls and on the grass , hardly talking , smoking , staring straight ahead - exhausted and traumatised by the constant flow of injured .
but new wounded were being brought in every few minutes .
and going the other way , cars bearing crosses on their roofs , taking away the dead .
a group of orthodox priests waited at one door , ready for the next call to administer the last rites .
then we were taken to see the morgue .
the telltale smell hit us as we entered .
feet poked out of green military body bags .
they were on the floor and in the cabinets - 16 bodies i counted .
this was just from the first part of the day , staff said .
" they 've been dying before we could treat them , " one doctor told us later .
a senior doctor said the hospital had been handling an average of 350 casualties each day .
" why are so many people being sacrificed for someone 's impulsive behaviour ? " he said - a comment apparently aimed at his own leader .
discontent since then , we have been told by medical sources that more than 100 georgian soldiers had been killed each day at the peak of the fighting - a very heavy toll for such a small army .
gori has seen intense violence under russian occupation with no air cover , georgian troops were almost totally exposed to russian warplanes .
no-one has any clear idea of civilian casualties , but they may be even higher .
as the week progressed and the news got worse , we heard more and more georgians denouncing their government for getting into this unequal war .
they condemned russia even more , but many georgians feel their leaders should have seen what was coming .
when we fed one of our reports from a local tv station , workers there were stunned .
we are not seeing this in the georgian media , one said .
we are not getting the true story .
the continued russian advance to within 30km -lrb- 18.5 miles -rrb- of tbilisi has helped shore up president mikhail saakashvili .
this is no longer a time for open criticism .
people have been rallying around the government .
i watched two children putting up their homemade " stop russia " signs on a tbilisi backstreet over the weekend .
but one political analyst predicted : " in a few weeks , maybe a month or so , when things quieten down , there will be protests . "
surreal in the meantime , with russian forces still occupying large parts of georgia despite the ceasefire , the country remains in limbo with some areas in a state of near-anarchy .
tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in tbilisi , many living in abandoned buildings with little assistance .
much of georgia 's american-trained army is in disarray .
many troops have taken off their uniforms and returned home .
we came across several units who admitted they had no orders and did not know what to do .
but there are still georgian troops posted along the roads and highways , close to russian lines .
there is a surreal side to the situation too .
for all the recent carnage , things can seem strangely relaxed .
in tbilisi , it is hard to know there is a conflict going on .
some " stop russia " banners can be seen .
but there is no extra security on the streets .
shops are full of supplies and the power is still on .
on saturday i watched an elderly man clad in brightly coloured lycra cycling purposefully on a racing bike along the main road to gori out of tbilisi .
just 30km away , that road is blocked by russian troops .
and on the banks of the mtkvari river which meanders through the capital , the same groups of fishermen are there every day , with the worst crisis in europe since the balkan wars still going on .

advertisement the edinburgh fringe has a venue dedicated to musical theatre reality tv shows such as i 'd do anything and how do you solve a problem like maria have stimulated an interest in musical theatre .
now , a new venue at the edinburgh fringe is dedicated to this much-maligned art form .
of course , as this is edinburgh , the 29 musicals being performed are not quite the old favourites such as cats or west side story .
titles include miss sign-on , zanna , do n't ! and big bruvva - the musical .
there is also cannibal ! - the musical , based on the cult film by trey parker , the creator of the south park cartoon series .
one of the shows features two performers who came to prominence in musical-based reality tv shows .
' spurred on ' keith jack came second last year in any dream will do , the bbc 's bid to find a joseph for a west end show .
niamh perry was one of the contestants attempting to be nancy in oliver ! in this year 's i 'd do anything .
they have teamed up to appear in only the brave , a musical about love and loss set during world war ii .
perry , from bangor , co down , said : " it has been really lovely to have my first professional job , to see what this industry is all about .
" it has really given me a taster and spurred me on to do this for the rest of my life , hopefully . "
keith jack appeared in any dream will do jack , from dalkeith in midlothian , said : " i 've always loved musical theatre .
" to sing and perform in front of crowds of people who enjoy the music and enjoy the shows and to take on a different character and to create something that is not yourself is just a great thing to be doing . "
only brave is a new show like many of those on offer at the musical theatre .
chris grady , programmer of musical theatre at the george square , said having the venue allowed companies to take artistic risks and attempt to produce the hit musicals of the future .
new work he said : " there was no theatre anywhere in britain dedicated to musical theatre .
" when the opportunity came and the university was looking to refurbish the theatre and reopen it with something , the idea came together to make this a hub .
" it is not a hub that would do old classic musicals , though we have got a few classics , but mainly that would look for new work and make new work happen . "
it is hoped the dedicated space will prove a useful training ground for up-and-coming performers .
andrew panton , acting head of musical theatre at the royal scottish academy of music and drama , said : " it gives the students an experience of working as a rep company and what it is like .
" they are all in two or three shows so they are working across completely different styles . "

the emergency services are continuing to work to clear the broadway underpass in belfast , which at one point was submerged under 20ft of flood water .
traffic managed to flow without major delay along the westlink , with m1 users heading along the broadway roundabout .
the underpass is expected to remain closed all day monday .
an investigation has been ordered by roads minister conor murphy into how it flooded .
mr murphy visited it over the weekend .
it is thought a pumping station beside the road was overwhelmed when a nearby river overflowed .
" i have asked roads service to carry out a full investigation into the underpass ' flooding , " he said .

a section of the central barrier of the adjoining westlink had to be cut with angle-grinders to allow motorists to flee flood waters .
it is thought up to half a dozen cars may be submerged in the underpass , having been abandoned by their owners as the water rose .
mr murphy said the relevant agencies met on friday after receiving weather warnings .
" as a result northern ireland water was able to deploy resources and contractors throughout the event and around the clock , " he said , " nevertheless , such was the extremity of the rainfall , that hundreds of homes were affected . "
it is thought that the road will reopen on tuesday .
the clean-up operation will continue in hundreds of flooded homes .
nearly a month 's rain fell in just a few hours on saturday afternoon causing rivers to burst their banks in counties antrim , down and londonderry .

" the fridge will have to be replaced , the washing machine , tumble drier - all gone , " he said .
environment minister sammy wilson announced a compensation package for anyone whose home was affected .

the emergency services are continuing to work to clear the broadway underpass in belfast , which at one point was submerged under 20ft of flood water .
traffic managed to flow without major delay along the westlink , with m1 users heading along the broadway roundabout .
the underpass is expected to remain closed all day monday .
an investigation has been ordered by roads minister conor murphy into how it flooded .
mr murphy visited it over the weekend .
it is thought a pumping station beside the road was overwhelmed when a nearby river overflowed .
" i have asked roads service to carry out a full investigation into the underpass ' flooding , " he said .

a section of the central barrier of the adjoining westlink had to be cut with angle-grinders to allow motorists to flee flood waters .
it is thought up to half a dozen cars may be submerged in the underpass , having been abandoned by their owners as the water rose .
mr murphy said the relevant agencies met on friday after receiving weather warnings .
" as a result northern ireland water was able to deploy resources and contractors throughout the event and around the clock , " he said , " nevertheless , such was the extremity of the rainfall , that hundreds of homes were affected . "

second omagh bomb service a second memorial service has been held to mark the 10th anniversary of the omagh bomb .
hundreds of people gathered in the new memorial garden , officially opened at a council organised ceremony on friday .
the families were joined by people from omagh and further afield , including other victims groups .
the large turnout was of great comfort to the relatives , on what was another difficult and emotional day .
the interdenominational service included prayers in hebrew , spanish and irish .
a minute 's silence was held and wreaths laid in memory of those who died .
they had gathered to mark ten years since the real ira bombing , which killed 29 people and unborn twins in the single greatest atrocity in northern ireland during the troubles .
it followed friday 's civic ceremony and the official opening of the new memorial garden organised by omagh council - but which was boycotted by some of the families who were there on sunday .
michael gallagher , whose son aidan , 21 , died , said : " the only proper tribute to omagh 's dead , ten years on , must be that full cross-border public inquiry .
" we call on public figures to back our call , otherwise the system continues to fail everyone and should hold its head in shame .
" they will be judged not on their token gestures but on what they have or have not done to actually bring justice to omagh , not wreathes . "

second omagh bomb service a second memorial service has been held to mark the 10th anniversary of the omagh bomb .
hundreds of people gathered in the new memorial garden , officially opened at a council organised ceremony on friday .
the families were joined by people from omagh and further afield , including other victims groups .
the large turnout was of great comfort to the relatives , on what was another difficult and emotional day .
the interdenominational service included prayers in hebrew , spanish and irish .
a minute 's silence was held and wreaths laid in memory of those who died .
they had gathered to mark ten years since the real ira bombing , which killed 29 people and unborn twins in the single greatest atrocity in northern ireland during the troubles .
it followed friday 's civic ceremony and the official opening of the new memorial garden organised by omagh council - but which was boycotted by some of the families who were there on sunday .
michael gallagher , whose son aidan , 21 , died , said : " the only proper tribute to omagh 's dead , ten years on , must be that full cross-border public inquiry .
" we call on public figures to back our call , otherwise the system continues to fail everyone and should hold its head in shame .
" they will be judged not on their token gestures but on what they have or have not done to actually bring justice to omagh , not wreathes . "

lord smith of finsbury said work was already under way to identify areas of the east and south coast most at risk .
he told the independent that the uk faced hard choices over which coasts to defend and which to leave to the sea .
lord smith said parts of north-east norfolk and suffolk were in the most immediate danger of collapse .
' huge issue ' the former culture secretary said it would not be possible to save all coastal homes from sea erosion , but that the agency would do its " level best " to protect places where there were significant numbers of properties .
" this is the most difficult issue we are going to face as an agency , " he said . "
we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast " lord smith environment agency chairman " we know the sea is eating away at the coast in quite a number of places , primarily - but not totally exclusively - on the east and south coasts .
" it 's a particularly huge issue in east anglia , but in quite a number of other areas as well . "
lord smith called on the government to assist families whose home will be lost , as ministers would not always be able to rely on insurance companies to cover them .
' particular threats ' he added : " we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast .
it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms .
" we will publish next year details of the work that 's been done , where we think the particular threats are , where we think there is current defence in place .
" we will begin to talk with communities where we think defence is not a viable option . "
lord smith also said the government was not taking the environment seriously in several major proposals .
these included a third runway at heathrow , a new generation of coal-fired power stations , and the severn barrage tidal energy project .

the fisher 's estuarine moth , which is found only on the coasts of north-east essex and north kent , is one of the most threatened species in the uk .
the lesser whirlpool ram 's-horn snail , which is rarely more than 5mm across , is restricted to a few locations in norfolk , suffolk and sussex .
the pool frog nearly died out in the 1990s and lives at one site in norfolk .
the three species will be protected from being killed , taken , injured , disturbed , owned or sold , or having their resting or breeding places destroyed .
if we had n't stepped in to create new areas of hog 's fennel away from the threat of rising sea levels this beautiful moth would have struggled to survive sarah brockless the fisher 's estuarine moth , which was discovered in the uk in the 1960s , has a total population estimated at between 1,000 and 5,000 .
its range is limited to areas of hog 's fennel - the sole food source of the fisher 's estuarine caterpillar .
but a partnership between conservationists and landowners is attempting to establish new habitats for the moth away from the threat of the sea .
natural england is encouraging landowners and farmers to plant hog fennel inland and sow seeds of the plant into established grassland .

" if we had n't stepped in to create new areas of hog 's fennel away from the threat of rising sea levels this beautiful moth would have struggled to survive , " said spokeswoman sarah brockless .
the rare pool frog , which is said to sound as if it has a " northern accent " , has a long history in britain , with remains dating back to 1,000 ad being found at sites in cambridgeshire and lincolnshire .
the last native frog died in the 1990s after the population shrank to just one site in norfolk .
but genetic studies and analysis of its distinct mating calls established it was part of a northern group of the species along with animals from norway and sweden .
the pool frog is found at one site in norfolk where it was reintroduced frogs were imported from sweden and introduced to a secret site in norfolk three years .
it is hoped that , with the new legal protection , it will be possible to reintroduce it to ponds in other parts of east anglia .
" early signs are encouraging that the pool frogs are settling in to the current release site , " said natural england amphibian specialist jim foster .
" however it will be several years before we can confidently assess the success of this reintroduction . "
the ram 's horn snail , which has a flattened spiral shell , is threatened by land drainage and inappropriate land management .
the new protection for three species , under the habitats regulations , comes into force from 1 october , minister for wildlife , joan ruddock said on monday .

the new £ 60m facility will be built on the north side of the existing welford road stadium in leicester .
charles rayner , head of stadium operations , said the work was expected to be finished by next may .
the plans for the expanded ground , which will have a 24,000-seat capacity , were approved in february and include a 175-bed hotel on the site .
giant cranes mr rayner said : " it is all wagons rolling now and we are ready to go . "
the first phase of work will concentrate on the north side of the ground and two 500-tonne cranes will be used for the major construction work .
the construction of the new stand will take place to the back of the current north stand .
mr rayner said the old stand would be demolished next may and the new one would be brought forward in the final phase .
between 40 and 60 workers will work on the site to begin with , but eventually the workforce will expand to 150 workers .
the stadium capacity is set to reach 30,000 seats when further expansion is completed in the next eight to 10 years .

here are some of the key quotes : personality / beliefs " i think i 'm canine rather than feline .
i like company , i like people , and that is much more dog-like than cat-like .
and i 'm more of a dog lover . "
" i 'm a pretty classic church of england ' racked with doubt and scepticism ' believer . "
political philosophy " my favourite political quote is by disraeli : he said the conservative party should be the party of change but change that goes along with the customs and manners and traditions and sentiments of the people rather than change according to some grand plan . "
" i 'm going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer , and radical social reform is what this country needs right now . "
family " samantha is actually very unconventional and hard to put in a box .
she went to a day school , was a goth at 14 , had quite a wild childhood , is unconventional and challenging and that is very good as it stopped me from being too straight down the line . "
" we sometimes row about politics but i 'd say the most common thing we row about is arrangements . "
" i tell her i love her when we go to bed at night , when we 're happy , which , fortunately for us , is quite a lot . "
" for two nights a week , i come home early enough to be with sam ; one i should be back for suppertime and the other i should be back to do bath time with the children . "
on being a crime victim " i 've been burgled twice in the last eight years , i 've had my car stolen and i was on my bike the other day and this white van had been following me , stopping and starting .
this was very late at night , about midnight , i was coming back from some dinner .
i got rather nervous about it so i turned down a road i do n't normally go down , and i slowed down and sort of pulled in behind a line of parked cars and as this van drove by this hand came out and just bashed me in the back with the aim of pushing me in front of the car .
luckily i managed to put the brakes on ...
but i 've never been the victim of proper violent crime . "
leadership " ... you appoint good people , and trust their decisions , but you have to know when to step in .
william hague has really helped me , because he made all the mistakes the first time round . "
" william hague once said to me , ' being leader of the conservative party and wearing a hat are incompatible ' . "
rivals " i absolutely believe that if we 'd have had that -lsb- 2007 -rsb- election that gordon brown would no longer have been prime minister and that the conservatives would have been the largest party in a hung parliament . "
" brown compounded calling off the election by then saying it was nothing to do with the polls , which was a massive mistake .
it was a lie and it was treating people like fools . "
asked for his favourite political joke : " -lsb- lib dem leader -rsb- nick clegg , at the moment . "
mistakes " i regret that my government driver took some of my papers home while i was on my bike ...
sometimes maybe i put off making decisions that maybe i should have taken earlier . "
tony blair " i remember going for a drink ... and it was just after john smith died , and we said it will be blair -lsb- who becomes next labour leader -rsb- and that will be disastrous for us . "
" he was n't tough enough with his team .
they kept saying , i am sorry i 'm not going to accept this , i do n't want to go .
well , i 'm sorry but in my position when i want someone to go i simply tell them , and then that 's that .
you have to be tough about it . "
