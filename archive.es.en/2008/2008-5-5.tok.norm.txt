yet everything is not as rosy as it might appear , says deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel . russian rulers have a soft spot for political symbolism , and there will be plenty of it on display this week .
the eight-year presidency of vladimir putin will come to an end on wednesday , may 7 , with dmitry medvedev taking over russia 's highest public office .
the day after the president 's inauguration , putin will be confirmed as prime minister by the duma . if the inauguration and the successful handover in the kremlin were n't enough , on friday , celebrations will get underway for the most important national holiday in modern russian history .

he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "
the " tandem democracy " of medvedev as president and putin as head of government is supposed to protect political and economic stability .
both ceaselessly repeated that they are doing it to help further modernize the country . but it 's questionable whether the new double rule of putin and medvedev can ensure political stability . in russian history , " dual power " brings instability .
the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .
at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .
and even more important is to know whether they will both adhere to this arrangement over the long term .

coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .

at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .

iran has been criticized for its increasing use of the death penalty . the european union urged iran to comply with international law and not go forward with the planned execution of behnoud shojaee .
the young man was 17 when he stabbed another boy with a piece of glass during a fight .
the european union also called for iran to also stop plans to execute " all other juvenile offenders on death row . "
iran has executed at least 28 child offenders since 1990 and has another 86 children on death row , according to the human rights group amnesty international .
slovenia , which currently hold the rotating eu presidency , said that the juvenile death sentences breach iran 's international obligations .
" the presidency of the eu is deeply concerned by the news of the imminent execution of behnoud shojaee , " according to the statement released sunday , may 4 .
shojaee 's execution is planned for wednesday , according to amnesty international .
shojaee is 20 , but was 17 at the time of his crime .
he allegedly stepped into a fight between a friend and another boy and ended up stabbing the other boy once with a shard of glass after being threatened with a knife .
executions on the rise in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants iran to give juvenile offenders a break iran has carried out numerous other executions in recent days , hanging a dozen convicted criminals , according to media reports .
at least one drug trafficker was hanged in public , an iranian newspaper report from monday said .
iran carried out 86 executions in 2008 , according to a count by the news agency afp .
amnesty international reported that in 2007 iran used the death penalty more than any other country apart from china , executing 317 people .
that was a sharp increase from the 177 executions carried out in 2006 .
iran classes murder , rape , armed robbery , drug trafficking and adultery as capital offenses .
human rights groups have accused iran of making excessive use of the death penalty , but tehran defends the practice as an effective deterrent carried out after an extensive judicial process .
all 27 eu states have abolished the death penalty and the eu has led calls for an international moratorium on the practice . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new study has found that by the year 2020 , the number of people belonging to germany 's middle class could fall below 50 percent of the population if economic growth rates do n't increase substantially . the study , by the consulting group mckinsey , found that in 12 years , 10 million fewer people could belong to the middle class than did at the beginning of the 1990s if economic growth levels do not surpass the forecast 1.7 percent , according to the german newspaper welt am sonntag , which had seen the report . " the economic growth that we have experienced over the past 15 years has not been enough to reach the citizens , " frank mattern , head of mckinsey 's germany operations , told the newspaper .
" for people in the middle-income range , small growth rates are equivalent to losses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endangered species ?
for the report , called " germany 2020 , " people are considered middle class if they earn between 70 and 150 percent of the average yearly wage in germany , which according to mckinsey in 2006 was around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,515 -rrb- . the researchers painted two scenarios for germany .
in the first , economic growth would proceed as predicted and almost 30 percent of germans would fall out of the middle class . a second , more positive scenario has the german economy growing at a more dynamic rate , around three percent annually .
according to that forecast , average per capita income could rise some 40 from 2006 to around 36,000 euros .
mckinsey based its calculations , according to the article , on research into eleven industrial sectors which make up more than 50 percent of the german economy . the last time germany experienced growth rates of three percent was in the middle of the 1980s , but mckinsey researchers have said reaching those levels again is not unrealistic . " we are proceeding on the assumption that we can reach a growth rate of three percent and well before 2020 , " mattern said .

that corresponds to a decrease from 49 to 44 million people in the middle-income range . in the period from 1996 to 2006 , the number of wealthy people earning more than 200 percent of the average income level went from 6.4 to 9.2 percent and the number of poor earning less than 50 percent of the average increased from 7.3 to 11.4 percent . old-age poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly is a big concern for women according to a survey by the emnid research institute published in the bild am sonntag newspaper , almost three-quarters of germans think that in a few years , poverty among the elderly will be the biggest problem the country faces . the poll found that 73 percent thought the days of expecting a comfortable retirement with a state-provided pension were soon to be a thing of the past .

a new study has found that by the year 2020 , the number of people belonging to germany 's middle class could fall below 50 percent of the population if economic growth rates do n't increase substantially . the study , by the consulting group mckinsey , found that in 12 years , 10 million fewer people could belong to the middle class than did at the beginning of the 1990s if economic growth levels do not surpass the forecast 1.7 percent , according to the german newspaper welt am sonntag , which had seen the report . " the economic growth that we have experienced over the past 15 years has not been enough to reach the citizens , " frank mattern , head of mckinsey 's germany operations , told the newspaper .
" for people in the middle-income range , small growth rates are equivalent to losses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endangered species ?
for the report , called " germany 2020 , " people are considered middle class if they earn between 70 and 150 percent of the average yearly wage in germany , which according to mckinsey in 2006 was around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,515 -rrb- . the researchers painted two scenarios for germany .
in the first , economic growth would proceed as predicted and almost 30 percent of germans would fall out of the middle class . a second , more positive scenario has the german economy growing at a more dynamic rate , around three percent annually .
according to that forecast , average per capita income could rise some 40 from 2006 to around 36,000 euros .
mckinsey based its calculations , according to the article , on research into eleven industrial sectors which make up more than 50 percent of the german economy . the last time germany experienced growth rates of three percent was in the middle of the 1980s , but mckinsey researchers have said reaching those levels again is not unrealistic . " we are proceeding on the assumption that we can reach a growth rate of three percent and well before 2020 , " mattern said .
" the world economy is growing at four percent . " the ends are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rich are getting richer the numbers correspond to a report put out the diw economics institute at the beginning of march that found the group of middle-income earners was shrinking while substantial growth was occurring at the two ends of the income spectrum : the rich and the poor . while the number of middle-income earners remained stable from 1992 to 2000 at 62 percent of the population , it had fallen to 54 percent by 2006 , researchers found .
that corresponds to a decrease from 49 to 44 million people in the middle-income range . in the period from 1996 to 2006 , the number of wealthy people earning more than 200 percent of the average income level went from 6.4 to 9.2 percent and the number of poor earning less than 50 percent of the average increased from 7.3 to 11.4 percent . old-age poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly is a big concern for women according to a survey by the emnid research institute published in the bild am sonntag newspaper , almost three-quarters of germans think that in a few years , poverty among the elderly will be the biggest problem the country faces . the poll found that 73 percent thought the days of expecting a comfortable retirement with a state-provided pension were soon to be a thing of the past .

but the two countries have managed to develop a friendly parthership based on solidarity , even if its start was difficult . german president horst koehler said during a speech to israel 's parliament , the knesset , that normality could not exist between germany and israel .
that was in 2005 , when the two countries had already been fostering diplomatic relations for 40 years .
the feeling that nothing could be normal between the two countries was even stronger in the first decade after the holocaust . from its outset , the young west german democracy was to bear the moral responsibility of the murder of millions of jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1960 : adenauer and ben- gurion in new york the first opportunity for chancellor konrad adenauer to establish relations with israel was in the form of financial compensation , or wiedergutmachung .
in 1952 , it was decided that some 3.45 billion deutsche marks -lrb- 1.76 billion euros , or $ 2.8 billion -rrb- would be paid to the israeli state to help " cleanse souls of infinite suffering , " as adenauer said . is shaking hands acceptable ? the reparations were controversial in israel because many believed that money was no compensation .
many israelis could not even imagine shaking hands with a german . that was not the case with david ben-gurion , israel 's first prime minister , who held a friendly meeting with adenauer in new york in 1960 .
ben-gurion was convinced that germany had changed and was no longer nazi-deutschland . " we should not forget what happened , but we should also not base our actions on what happened , " he said . on the domestic front , ben-gurion reaped a great deal of criticism for his attitude , while adenauer was put under pressure by arab states for seeking relations with israel . " relatively early " bildunterschrift : 1965 : rolf pauls -lrb- l -rrb- with israeli president zalman shazar in 1965 , two decades after the war , the federal republic of germany and israel established diplomatic relations .
rolf pauls , the first ambassador to israel , found - as he was greeted with protests in the country - that it was " relatively early . " israel and west germany then took baby steps toward one another .
a network of contacts on the civilian level was also established and helped relations during times of crises .
for israel , it was important that germany demonstrated its solidarity during difficult times , such as the wars with neighboring arab nations . germany continues to try to fulfill this wish for solidarity - even 60 years after the founding of israel .
" germany bears a particular responsibility for israel - for protecting and defending its right to exist , " said foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , in describing one of the foundations of germany 's foreign policy toward the jewish state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2008 : israel 's president shimon peres -lrb- l -rrb- welcomes german chancellor merkel this stance , however , also explains why the federal republic is inhibited in taking a stand on the conflict between israel and the palestinians . speechlessness is normal a certain speechlessness is also manifest in the calm that has meanwhile developed in the relationship between israel and germany .

while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .
the states of the arab league , which had been founded not long before , hoped to exterminate the new entity they believed the west had brought upon them - the british with the balfour declaration , in which they promised the jews support in the establishment of a national homeland in 1917 ; the un with its 1947 partition plan for palestine ; and the united states with its active support for the foundation of the state of israel .

israel expanded its territory even beyond the lines of the partition .
more than 750,000 palestinians were forced to leave their homes - out of fear for their lives or because they were expelled .
they remain the central problem in the conflict 60 years later - and their numbers have grown to around 4 million . the 1948 defeat affected the arabs - indeed the whole muslim world - deeply .
they were unwilling to accept the result and vowed vengeance .
and because the arabs were loath to admit their defeat at the hands of the tiny jewish state , they held the west responsible for it .
thus , the legend arose that nurtures radical groups and demagogues to this day : israel as the outpost of an anti-arabic and anti-islamic west in the middle east , just as the crusaders were hundreds of years ago . common cause israel 's enemies believe they have repeatedly seen their thesis confirmed .
in 1956 , they saw as confirmation that israel , france and britain joined forces in the suez crisis .
the europeans were concerned about the suez canal , while the israelis wanted to ensure the security of their border to egypt .
during the cold war , egypt , syria and iraq became allies with moscow , which strengthened all the more the connection between the us and israel and conservative arab states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1977 : israel 's menachem begin whispers to egypt 's anwar sadat the most important change came after the six-day war in june 1967 .
despite israeli warnings , egyptian president gamal abdel nasser closed the straits of tiran , giving israel an excuse for a preventive strike .
jordan and syria 's intervention was no help to cairo .
within six days , israel had seized the entire sinai peninsula , the gaza strip , the west bank and the golan heights . suddenly israel controlled all of historic palestine .
some israelis were hopeful that a call would come from amman or cairo offering peace in exchange for occupied territory .
but the telephone did n't ring .
instead , in khartoum , the arab league declared its " three no 's " : no peace with israel , no recognition of israel , no negotiations with israel . peace with the arch-enemy in the 1973 yom kippur war , the arabs succeeded in improving their damaged self-confidence , with syria and egypt causing heavy damage to israel .
but the war ended without victors .
the new constellation , however , allowed egyptian president anwar sadat to start a peace initiative which culminated in the camp david accords between egypt and israel in 1978 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1993 : rabin and arafat sealed the peace deal at the white house the palestinians could have been part of the peace agreement , but with encouragement from the arab world , they rejected it .
it was n't until 15 years later , in 1993 , that israel and the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- under yasser arafat agreed on the oslo peace plan , which was meant to lead to israel pulling out of the occupied territories and the foundation of a palestinian state .
finally the most important palestinian groups were willing to accept the two-state solution recommended by the un partition plan 46 years previously . rabin 's assassination but resistance came from the israeli side too .
likud party nationalists under benjamin netanyahu denounced what they said was a betrayal of the historic homeland , as they viewed all of palestine as eretz yisrael , belonging to the land of israel .
they warned against the dangers for israel of giving up the occupied territories . in november 1995 prime minister yitzhak rabin , who had signed the oslo accords , was assassinated .
the following year , netanyahu was elected prime minister , and israel began to sabotage the implementation of the oslo plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1995 : rabin 's assassination by an israeli came as a shock growing dissatisfaction among palestinians added to the political crisis in israel .
in autumn 2000 the second intifada started .
in the course of the " al-aqsa intifada " nearly every positive development in the palestinian territories was destroyed : autonomous self-administration once again became occupied territories , and israel , under ariel sharon , started to close itself off from the palestinians behind a gigantic wall . no compromise it was only after arafat 's death , in november 2004 , and with great effort , that negotiations resumed , but they failed to bring results .
at the same time , those opposed to any kind of settlement gained ever more influence .
in early 2006 , hamas won elections in the palestinian territories .
the islamist group refused to recognize israel or the oslo accords , and the palestinians again became isolated , particularly from the west .
israel was intransigent , deciding to make no more compromises .

the palestinians fight among themselves .
israel intends to spend millions on celebrating the 60th anniversary of statehood , but even that is controversial .

while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .
the states of the arab league , which had been founded not long before , hoped to exterminate the new entity they believed the west had brought upon them - the british with the balfour declaration , in which they promised the jews support in the establishment of a national homeland in 1917 ; the un with its 1947 partition plan for palestine ; and the united states with its active support for the foundation of the state of israel .

israel expanded its territory even beyond the lines of the partition .
more than 750,000 palestinians were forced to leave their homes - out of fear for their lives or because they were expelled .
they remain the central problem in the conflict 60 years later - and their numbers have grown to around 4 million . the 1948 defeat affected the arabs - indeed the whole muslim world - deeply .
they were unwilling to accept the result and vowed vengeance .
and because the arabs were loath to admit their defeat at the hands of the tiny jewish state , they held the west responsible for it .
thus , the legend arose that nurtures radical groups and demagogues to this day : israel as the outpost of an anti-arabic and anti-islamic west in the middle east , just as the crusaders were hundreds of years ago . common cause israel 's enemies believe they have repeatedly seen their thesis confirmed .
in 1956 , they saw as confirmation that israel , france and britain joined forces in the suez crisis .
the europeans were concerned about the suez canal , while the israelis wanted to ensure the security of their border to egypt .
during the cold war , egypt , syria and iraq became allies with moscow , which strengthened all the more the connection between the us and israel and conservative arab states .

despite israeli warnings , egyptian president gamal abdel nasser closed the straits of tiran , giving israel an excuse for a preventive strike .
jordan and syria 's intervention was no help to cairo .
within six days , israel had seized the entire sinai peninsula , the gaza strip , the west bank and the golan heights . suddenly israel controlled all of historic palestine .
some israelis were hopeful that a call would come from amman or cairo offering peace in exchange for occupied territory .
but the telephone did n't ring .
instead , in khartoum , the arab league declared its " three no 's " : no peace with israel , no recognition of israel , no negotiations with israel . peace with the arch-enemy in the 1973 yom kippur war , the arabs succeeded in improving their damaged self-confidence , with syria and egypt causing heavy damage to israel .
but the war ended without victors .

finally the most important palestinian groups were willing to accept the two-state solution recommended by the un partition plan 46 years previously . rabin 's assassination but resistance came from the israeli side too .
likud party nationalists under benjamin netanyahu denounced what they said was a betrayal of the historic homeland , as they viewed all of palestine as eretz yisrael , belonging to the land of israel .
they warned against the dangers for israel of giving up the occupied territories . in november 1995 prime minister yitzhak rabin , who had signed the oslo accords , was assassinated .
the following year , netanyahu was elected prime minister , and israel began to sabotage the implementation of the oslo plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1995 : rabin 's assassination by an israeli came as a shock growing dissatisfaction among palestinians added to the political crisis in israel .
in autumn 2000 the second intifada started .
in the course of the " al-aqsa intifada " nearly every positive development in the palestinian territories was destroyed : autonomous self-administration once again became occupied territories , and israel , under ariel sharon , started to close itself off from the palestinians behind a gigantic wall . no compromise it was only after arafat 's death , in november 2004 , and with great effort , that negotiations resumed , but they failed to bring results .
at the same time , those opposed to any kind of settlement gained ever more influence .
in early 2006 , hamas won elections in the palestinian territories .
the islamist group refused to recognize israel or the oslo accords , and the palestinians again became isolated , particularly from the west .

while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .
the states of the arab league , which had been founded not long before , hoped to exterminate the new entity they believed the west had brought upon them - the british with the balfour declaration , in which they promised the jews support in the establishment of a national homeland in 1917 ; the un with its 1947 partition plan for palestine ; and the united states with its active support for the foundation of the state of israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1973 : general moshe dayan -lrb- l . -rrb- with ariel sharon on the egyptian side of the suez canal against all expectations , the arab plan failed .
israel expanded its territory even beyond the lines of the partition .
more than 750,000 palestinians were forced to leave their homes - out of fear for their lives or because they were expelled .
they remain the central problem in the conflict 60 years later - and their numbers have grown to around 4 million . the 1948 defeat affected the arabs - indeed the whole muslim world - deeply .
they were unwilling to accept the result and vowed vengeance .
and because the arabs were loath to admit their defeat at the hands of the tiny jewish state , they held the west responsible for it .
thus , the legend arose that nurtures radical groups and demagogues to this day : israel as the outpost of an anti-arabic and anti-islamic west in the middle east , just as the crusaders were hundreds of years ago . common cause israel 's enemies believe they have repeatedly seen their thesis confirmed .
in 1956 , they saw as confirmation that israel , france and britain joined forces in the suez crisis .
the europeans were concerned about the suez canal , while the israelis wanted to ensure the security of their border to egypt .
during the cold war , egypt , syria and iraq became allies with moscow , which strengthened all the more the connection between the us and israel and conservative arab states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1977 : israel 's menachem begin whispers to egypt 's anwar sadat the most important change came after the six-day war in june 1967 .
despite israeli warnings , egyptian president gamal abdel nasser closed the straits of tiran , giving israel an excuse for a preventive strike .
jordan and syria 's intervention was no help to cairo .
within six days , israel had seized the entire sinai peninsula , the gaza strip , the west bank and the golan heights . suddenly israel controlled all of historic palestine .
some israelis were hopeful that a call would come from amman or cairo offering peace in exchange for occupied territory .
but the telephone did n't ring .
instead , in khartoum , the arab league declared its " three no 's " : no peace with israel , no recognition of israel , no negotiations with israel . peace with the arch-enemy in the 1973 yom kippur war , the arabs succeeded in improving their damaged self-confidence , with syria and egypt causing heavy damage to israel .
but the war ended without victors .
the new constellation , however , allowed egyptian president anwar sadat to start a peace initiative which culminated in the camp david accords between egypt and israel in 1978 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1993 : rabin and arafat sealed the peace deal at the white house the palestinians could have been part of the peace agreement , but with encouragement from the arab world , they rejected it .
it was n't until 15 years later , in 1993 , that israel and the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- under yasser arafat agreed on the oslo peace plan , which was meant to lead to israel pulling out of the occupied territories and the foundation of a palestinian state .
finally the most important palestinian groups were willing to accept the two-state solution recommended by the un partition plan 46 years previously . rabin 's assassination but resistance came from the israeli side too .
likud party nationalists under benjamin netanyahu denounced what they said was a betrayal of the historic homeland , as they viewed all of palestine as eretz yisrael , belonging to the land of israel .
they warned against the dangers for israel of giving up the occupied territories . in november 1995 prime minister yitzhak rabin , who had signed the oslo accords , was assassinated .
the following year , netanyahu was elected prime minister , and israel began to sabotage the implementation of the oslo plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1995 : rabin 's assassination by an israeli came as a shock growing dissatisfaction among palestinians added to the political crisis in israel .
in autumn 2000 the second intifada started .
in the course of the " al-aqsa intifada " nearly every positive development in the palestinian territories was destroyed : autonomous self-administration once again became occupied territories , and israel , under ariel sharon , started to close itself off from the palestinians behind a gigantic wall . no compromise it was only after arafat 's death , in november 2004 , and with great effort , that negotiations resumed , but they failed to bring results .
at the same time , those opposed to any kind of settlement gained ever more influence .
in early 2006 , hamas won elections in the palestinian territories .
the islamist group refused to recognize israel or the oslo accords , and the palestinians again became isolated , particularly from the west .
israel was intransigent , deciding to make no more compromises .
the situation in the gaza strip , which israel had evacuated , began to resemble war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a legacy of violence that us president george w. bush wanted to finish his last year in office with peace in the middle east made no difference .
there was nothing to indicate he would succeed . instead , the atmosphere among palestinians and israelis continues to deteriorate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.05.2008 germany 's middle class shrinking fast , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany 's future feature more homeless on the streets ?
a new study has found that by the year 2020 , the number of people belonging to germany 's middle class could fall below 50 percent of the population if economic growth rates do n't increase substantially . the study , by the consulting group mckinsey , found that in 12 years , 10 million fewer people could belong to the middle class than did at the beginning of the 1990s if economic growth levels do not surpass the forecast 1.7 percent , according to the german newspaper welt am sonntag , which had seen the report . " the economic growth that we have experienced over the past 15 years has not been enough to reach the citizens , " frank mattern , head of mckinsey 's germany operations , told the newspaper .
" for people in the middle-income range , small growth rates are equivalent to losses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endangered species ?
for the report , called " germany 2020 , " people are considered middle class if they earn between 70 and 150 percent of the average yearly wage in germany , which according to mckinsey in 2006 was around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,515 -rrb- . the researchers painted two scenarios for germany .
in the first , economic growth would proceed as predicted and almost 30 percent of germans would fall out of the middle class . a second , more positive scenario has the german economy growing at a more dynamic rate , around three percent annually .
according to that forecast , average per capita income could rise some 40 from 2006 to around 36,000 euros .
mckinsey based its calculations , according to the article , on research into eleven industrial sectors which make up more than 50 percent of the german economy . the last time germany experienced growth rates of three percent was in the middle of the 1980s , but mckinsey researchers have said reaching those levels again is not unrealistic . " we are proceeding on the assumption that we can reach a growth rate of three percent and well before 2020 , " mattern said .
" the world economy is growing at four percent . " the ends are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rich are getting richer the numbers correspond to a report put out the diw economics institute at the beginning of march that found the group of middle-income earners was shrinking while substantial growth was occurring at the two ends of the income spectrum : the rich and the poor . while the number of middle-income earners remained stable from 1992 to 2000 at 62 percent of the population , it had fallen to 54 percent by 2006 , researchers found .
that corresponds to a decrease from 49 to 44 million people in the middle-income range . in the period from 1996 to 2006 , the number of wealthy people earning more than 200 percent of the average income level went from 6.4 to 9.2 percent and the number of poor earning less than 50 percent of the average increased from 7.3 to 11.4 percent . old-age poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly is a big concern for women according to a survey by the emnid research institute published in the bild am sonntag newspaper , almost three-quarters of germans think that in a few years , poverty among the elderly will be the biggest problem the country faces . the poll found that 73 percent thought the days of expecting a comfortable retirement with a state-provided pension were soon to be a thing of the past .
the concern is especially acute among women and those between 50 and 64 years of age , the paper said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new study has found that by the year 2020 , the number of people belonging to germany 's middle class could fall below 50 percent of the population if economic growth rates do n't increase substantially . the study , by the consulting group mckinsey , found that in 12 years , 10 million fewer people could belong to the middle class than did at the beginning of the 1990s if economic growth levels do not surpass the forecast 1.7 percent , according to the german newspaper welt am sonntag , which had seen the report . " the economic growth that we have experienced over the past 15 years has not been enough to reach the citizens , " frank mattern , head of mckinsey 's germany operations , told the newspaper .
" for people in the middle-income range , small growth rates are equivalent to losses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endangered species ?
for the report , called " germany 2020 , " people are considered middle class if they earn between 70 and 150 percent of the average yearly wage in germany , which according to mckinsey in 2006 was around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,515 -rrb- . the researchers painted two scenarios for germany .
in the first , economic growth would proceed as predicted and almost 30 percent of germans would fall out of the middle class . a second , more positive scenario has the german economy growing at a more dynamic rate , around three percent annually .
according to that forecast , average per capita income could rise some 40 from 2006 to around 36,000 euros .
mckinsey based its calculations , according to the article , on research into eleven industrial sectors which make up more than 50 percent of the german economy . the last time germany experienced growth rates of three percent was in the middle of the 1980s , but mckinsey researchers have said reaching those levels again is not unrealistic . " we are proceeding on the assumption that we can reach a growth rate of three percent and well before 2020 , " mattern said .

that corresponds to a decrease from 49 to 44 million people in the middle-income range . in the period from 1996 to 2006 , the number of wealthy people earning more than 200 percent of the average income level went from 6.4 to 9.2 percent and the number of poor earning less than 50 percent of the average increased from 7.3 to 11.4 percent . old-age poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly is a big concern for women according to a survey by the emnid research institute published in the bild am sonntag newspaper , almost three-quarters of germans think that in a few years , poverty among the elderly will be the biggest problem the country faces . the poll found that 73 percent thought the days of expecting a comfortable retirement with a state-provided pension were soon to be a thing of the past .

yet everything is not as rosy as it might appear , says deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel . russian rulers have a soft spot for political symbolism , and there will be plenty of it on display this week .
the eight-year presidency of vladimir putin will come to an end on wednesday , may 7 , with dmitry medvedev taking over russia 's highest public office .
the day after the president 's inauguration , putin will be confirmed as prime minister by the duma . if the inauguration and the successful handover in the kremlin were n't enough , on friday , celebrations will get underway for the most important national holiday in modern russian history .
victory over nazi germany in world war ii will be observed with parades and pathos . it 's difficult to imagine a more grandiose finale to " operation successor . " putin 's sweeping success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel you have to hand it to vladimir putin .
he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "
the " tandem democracy " of medvedev as president and putin as head of government is supposed to protect political and economic stability .
both ceaselessly repeated that they are doing it to help further modernize the country . but it 's questionable whether the new double rule of putin and medvedev can ensure political stability . in russian history , " dual power " brings instability .
the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .
at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .

the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .
at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .
and even more important is to know whether they will both adhere to this arrangement over the long term .
if not , stability and continuity will give way to friction and instability . ingo mannteufel is head of the russian section of dw-radio and dw-world.de. -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this can not be the model for us , " steinmeier , who under former chancellor gerhard schroeder strongly opposed the iraq war , said . evolving threats leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have proposed setting up a german version of the us nsc . in a joint draft strategy paper , they argue that the new council would serve as a " political analysis , coordination and decision-making center " in the face of evolving threats . the paper calls for a concentration of all forces to secure both internal and external security in a national security council under the chairmanship of the german chancellor .
the proposal includes deploying the bundeswehr or german army within german borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party says global terrorism poses unforeseen threats " the threat of global terrorism makes it important that we get past the traditional division of domestic and foreign security , " volker kauder , the conservatives ' parliamentary leader , told the welt am sonntag paper over the weekend .

" these plans have to be taken off the table , " spd foreign policy expert gert weisskirchen told the tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he added that there " absolutely no need " to relocate foreign policy decisions from the foreign ministry to the chancellery , as the plan reportedly calls for . opposition remains sceptical the proposal has also been slammed by opposition parties . the head of the free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , told the schleswig-holstein am sonntag newspaper he thought the cdu / csu plan could " massively shift - and damage - our foreign policy . "
he said he also feared the proposal could be used as an initial step in allowing the domestic deployment of the germany army , a plan which the fdp has long rejected . claudia roth , head of the greens said the nsc proposal redefined the duties of the german army in a " dramatic fashion . " " the conservatives want to send german soldiers to wars for oil and water .

" on monday , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a news conference that chancellor merkel supported the creation of the nsc . social democrats cry foul however , senior social democrats who share power in an uneasy grand coalition government with the cdu have criticized the plan , arguing it 's a thinly-veiled attempt at wresting policy away from the foreign ministry led by steinmeier . peter struck , head of the spd group in parliament , said the nsc was totally superfluous . " these plans have to be taken off the table , " spd foreign policy expert gert weisskirchen told the tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he added that there " absolutely no need " to relocate foreign policy decisions from the foreign ministry to the chancellery , as the plan reportedly calls for . opposition remains sceptical the proposal has also been slammed by opposition parties . the head of the free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , told the schleswig-holstein am sonntag newspaper he thought the cdu / csu plan could " massively shift - and damage - our foreign policy . "
he said he also feared the proposal could be used as an initial step in allowing the domestic deployment of the germany army , a plan which the fdp has long rejected . claudia roth , head of the greens said the nsc proposal redefined the duties of the german army in a " dramatic fashion . " " the conservatives want to send german soldiers to wars for oil and water .
that ca n't be the answer to global crises and global warming , " roth told german news agency dpa . german media has reported the conservatives planned to present their report to party members on tuesday and the entire bundestag on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new study has found that by the year 2020 , the number of people belonging to germany 's middle class could fall below 50 percent of the population if economic growth rates do n't increase substantially . the study , by the consulting group mckinsey , found that in 12 years , 10 million fewer people could belong to the middle class than did at the beginning of the 1990s if economic growth levels do not surpass the forecast 1.7 percent , according to the german newspaper welt am sonntag , which had seen the report . " the economic growth that we have experienced over the past 15 years has not been enough to reach the citizens , " frank mattern , head of mckinsey 's germany operations , told the newspaper .
" for people in the middle-income range , small growth rates are equivalent to losses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endangered species ?
for the report , called " germany 2020 , " people are considered middle class if they earn between 70 and 150 percent of the average yearly wage in germany , which according to mckinsey in 2006 was around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,515 -rrb- . the researchers painted two scenarios for germany .
in the first , economic growth would proceed as predicted and almost 30 percent of germans would fall out of the middle class . a second , more positive scenario has the german economy growing at a more dynamic rate , around three percent annually .
according to that forecast , average per capita income could rise some 40 from 2006 to around 36,000 euros .
mckinsey based its calculations , according to the article , on research into eleven industrial sectors which make up more than 50 percent of the german economy . the last time germany experienced growth rates of three percent was in the middle of the 1980s , but mckinsey researchers have said reaching those levels again is not unrealistic . " we are proceeding on the assumption that we can reach a growth rate of three percent and well before 2020 , " mattern said .
" the world economy is growing at four percent . " the ends are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rich are getting richer the numbers correspond to a report put out the diw economics institute at the beginning of march that found the group of middle-income earners was shrinking while substantial growth was occurring at the two ends of the income spectrum : the rich and the poor . while the number of middle-income earners remained stable from 1992 to 2000 at 62 percent of the population , it had fallen to 54 percent by 2006 , researchers found .
that corresponds to a decrease from 49 to 44 million people in the middle-income range . in the period from 1996 to 2006 , the number of wealthy people earning more than 200 percent of the average income level went from 6.4 to 9.2 percent and the number of poor earning less than 50 percent of the average increased from 7.3 to 11.4 percent . old-age poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly is a big concern for women according to a survey by the emnid research institute published in the bild am sonntag newspaper , almost three-quarters of germans think that in a few years , poverty among the elderly will be the biggest problem the country faces . the poll found that 73 percent thought the days of expecting a comfortable retirement with a state-provided pension were soon to be a thing of the past .

iran has been criticized for its increasing use of the death penalty . the european union urged iran to comply with international law and not go forward with the planned execution of behnoud shojaee .
the young man was 17 when he stabbed another boy with a piece of glass during a fight .
the european union also called for iran to also stop plans to execute " all other juvenile offenders on death row . "
iran has executed at least 28 child offenders since 1990 and has another 86 children on death row , according to the human rights group amnesty international .
slovenia , which currently hold the rotating eu presidency , said that the juvenile death sentences breach iran 's international obligations .
" the presidency of the eu is deeply concerned by the news of the imminent execution of behnoud shojaee , " according to the statement released sunday , may 4 .
shojaee 's execution is planned for wednesday , according to amnesty international .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.05.2008 germany 's middle class shrinking fast , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany 's future feature more homeless on the streets ?
a new study has found that by the year 2020 , the number of people belonging to germany 's middle class could fall below 50 percent of the population if economic growth rates do n't increase substantially . the study , by the consulting group mckinsey , found that in 12 years , 10 million fewer people could belong to the middle class than did at the beginning of the 1990s if economic growth levels do not surpass the forecast 1.7 percent , according to the german newspaper welt am sonntag , which had seen the report . " the economic growth that we have experienced over the past 15 years has not been enough to reach the citizens , " frank mattern , head of mckinsey 's germany operations , told the newspaper .
" for people in the middle-income range , small growth rates are equivalent to losses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endangered species ?
for the report , called " germany 2020 , " people are considered middle class if they earn between 70 and 150 percent of the average yearly wage in germany , which according to mckinsey in 2006 was around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,515 -rrb- . the researchers painted two scenarios for germany .
in the first , economic growth would proceed as predicted and almost 30 percent of germans would fall out of the middle class . a second , more positive scenario has the german economy growing at a more dynamic rate , around three percent annually .
according to that forecast , average per capita income could rise some 40 from 2006 to around 36,000 euros .
mckinsey based its calculations , according to the article , on research into eleven industrial sectors which make up more than 50 percent of the german economy . the last time germany experienced growth rates of three percent was in the middle of the 1980s , but mckinsey researchers have said reaching those levels again is not unrealistic . " we are proceeding on the assumption that we can reach a growth rate of three percent and well before 2020 , " mattern said .
" the world economy is growing at four percent . " the ends are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rich are getting richer the numbers correspond to a report put out the diw economics institute at the beginning of march that found the group of middle-income earners was shrinking while substantial growth was occurring at the two ends of the income spectrum : the rich and the poor . while the number of middle-income earners remained stable from 1992 to 2000 at 62 percent of the population , it had fallen to 54 percent by 2006 , researchers found .

" this can not be the model for us , " steinmeier , who under former chancellor gerhard schroeder strongly opposed the iraq war , said . evolving threats leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have proposed setting up a german version of the us nsc . in a joint draft strategy paper , they argue that the new council would serve as a " political analysis , coordination and decision-making center " in the face of evolving threats . the paper calls for a concentration of all forces to secure both internal and external security in a national security council under the chairmanship of the german chancellor .
the proposal includes deploying the bundeswehr or german army within german borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party says global terrorism poses unforeseen threats " the threat of global terrorism makes it important that we get past the traditional division of domestic and foreign security , " volker kauder , the conservatives ' parliamentary leader , told the welt am sonntag paper over the weekend .
" ensuring the supply of energy and raw materials is another important security policy point . " on monday , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a news conference that chancellor merkel supported the creation of the nsc . social democrats cry foul however , senior social democrats who share power in an uneasy grand coalition government with the cdu have criticized the plan , arguing it 's a thinly-veiled attempt at wresting policy away from the foreign ministry led by steinmeier . peter struck , head of the spd group in parliament , said the nsc was totally superfluous . " these plans have to be taken off the table , " spd foreign policy expert gert weisskirchen told the tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he added that there " absolutely no need " to relocate foreign policy decisions from the foreign ministry to the chancellery , as the plan reportedly calls for . opposition remains sceptical the proposal has also been slammed by opposition parties . the head of the free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , told the schleswig-holstein am sonntag newspaper he thought the cdu / csu plan could " massively shift - and damage - our foreign policy . "
he said he also feared the proposal could be used as an initial step in allowing the domestic deployment of the germany army , a plan which the fdp has long rejected . claudia roth , head of the greens said the nsc proposal redefined the duties of the german army in a " dramatic fashion . " " the conservatives want to send german soldiers to wars for oil and water .
that ca n't be the answer to global crises and global warming , " roth told german news agency dpa . german media has reported the conservatives planned to present their report to party members on tuesday and the entire bundestag on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iran has been criticized for its increasing use of the death penalty . the european union urged iran to comply with international law and not go forward with the planned execution of behnoud shojaee .
the young man was 17 when he stabbed another boy with a piece of glass during a fight .
the european union also called for iran to also stop plans to execute " all other juvenile offenders on death row . "
iran has executed at least 28 child offenders since 1990 and has another 86 children on death row , according to the human rights group amnesty international .
slovenia , which currently hold the rotating eu presidency , said that the juvenile death sentences breach iran 's international obligations .
" the presidency of the eu is deeply concerned by the news of the imminent execution of behnoud shojaee , " according to the statement released sunday , may 4 .
shojaee 's execution is planned for wednesday , according to amnesty international .
shojaee is 20 , but was 17 at the time of his crime .
he allegedly stepped into a fight between a friend and another boy and ended up stabbing the other boy once with a shard of glass after being threatened with a knife .
executions on the rise in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants iran to give juvenile offenders a break iran has carried out numerous other executions in recent days , hanging a dozen convicted criminals , according to media reports .
at least one drug trafficker was hanged in public , an iranian newspaper report from monday said .
iran carried out 86 executions in 2008 , according to a count by the news agency afp .
amnesty international reported that in 2007 iran used the death penalty more than any other country apart from china , executing 317 people .
that was a sharp increase from the 177 executions carried out in 2006 .
iran classes murder , rape , armed robbery , drug trafficking and adultery as capital offenses .
human rights groups have accused iran of making excessive use of the death penalty , but tehran defends the practice as an effective deterrent carried out after an extensive judicial process .
all 27 eu states have abolished the death penalty and the eu has led calls for an international moratorium on the practice . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .
the states of the arab league , which had been founded not long before , hoped to exterminate the new entity they believed the west had brought upon them - the british with the balfour declaration , in which they promised the jews support in the establishment of a national homeland in 1917 ; the un with its 1947 partition plan for palestine ; and the united states with its active support for the foundation of the state of israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1973 : general moshe dayan -lrb- l . -rrb- with ariel sharon on the egyptian side of the suez canal against all expectations , the arab plan failed .
israel expanded its territory even beyond the lines of the partition .
more than 750,000 palestinians were forced to leave their homes - out of fear for their lives or because they were expelled .
they remain the central problem in the conflict 60 years later - and their numbers have grown to around 4 million . the 1948 defeat affected the arabs - indeed the whole muslim world - deeply .
they were unwilling to accept the result and vowed vengeance .
and because the arabs were loath to admit their defeat at the hands of the tiny jewish state , they held the west responsible for it .
thus , the legend arose that nurtures radical groups and demagogues to this day : israel as the outpost of an anti-arabic and anti-islamic west in the middle east , just as the crusaders were hundreds of years ago . common cause israel 's enemies believe they have repeatedly seen their thesis confirmed .
in 1956 , they saw as confirmation that israel , france and britain joined forces in the suez crisis .
the europeans were concerned about the suez canal , while the israelis wanted to ensure the security of their border to egypt .
during the cold war , egypt , syria and iraq became allies with moscow , which strengthened all the more the connection between the us and israel and conservative arab states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1977 : israel 's menachem begin whispers to egypt 's anwar sadat the most important change came after the six-day war in june 1967 .
despite israeli warnings , egyptian president gamal abdel nasser closed the straits of tiran , giving israel an excuse for a preventive strike .
jordan and syria 's intervention was no help to cairo .
within six days , israel had seized the entire sinai peninsula , the gaza strip , the west bank and the golan heights . suddenly israel controlled all of historic palestine .
some israelis were hopeful that a call would come from amman or cairo offering peace in exchange for occupied territory .
but the telephone did n't ring .
instead , in khartoum , the arab league declared its " three no 's " : no peace with israel , no recognition of israel , no negotiations with israel . peace with the arch-enemy in the 1973 yom kippur war , the arabs succeeded in improving their damaged self-confidence , with syria and egypt causing heavy damage to israel .
but the war ended without victors .
the new constellation , however , allowed egyptian president anwar sadat to start a peace initiative which culminated in the camp david accords between egypt and israel in 1978 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1993 : rabin and arafat sealed the peace deal at the white house the palestinians could have been part of the peace agreement , but with encouragement from the arab world , they rejected it .
it was n't until 15 years later , in 1993 , that israel and the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- under yasser arafat agreed on the oslo peace plan , which was meant to lead to israel pulling out of the occupied territories and the foundation of a palestinian state .
finally the most important palestinian groups were willing to accept the two-state solution recommended by the un partition plan 46 years previously . rabin 's assassination but resistance came from the israeli side too .
likud party nationalists under benjamin netanyahu denounced what they said was a betrayal of the historic homeland , as they viewed all of palestine as eretz yisrael , belonging to the land of israel .
they warned against the dangers for israel of giving up the occupied territories . in november 1995 prime minister yitzhak rabin , who had signed the oslo accords , was assassinated .
the following year , netanyahu was elected prime minister , and israel began to sabotage the implementation of the oslo plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1995 : rabin 's assassination by an israeli came as a shock growing dissatisfaction among palestinians added to the political crisis in israel .
in autumn 2000 the second intifada started .
in the course of the " al-aqsa intifada " nearly every positive development in the palestinian territories was destroyed : autonomous self-administration once again became occupied territories , and israel , under ariel sharon , started to close itself off from the palestinians behind a gigantic wall . no compromise it was only after arafat 's death , in november 2004 , and with great effort , that negotiations resumed , but they failed to bring results .
at the same time , those opposed to any kind of settlement gained ever more influence .
in early 2006 , hamas won elections in the palestinian territories .
the islamist group refused to recognize israel or the oslo accords , and the palestinians again became isolated , particularly from the west .
israel was intransigent , deciding to make no more compromises .
the situation in the gaza strip , which israel had evacuated , began to resemble war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a legacy of violence that us president george w. bush wanted to finish his last year in office with peace in the middle east made no difference .
there was nothing to indicate he would succeed . instead , the atmosphere among palestinians and israelis continues to deteriorate .
the palestinians fight among themselves .
israel intends to spend millions on celebrating the 60th anniversary of statehood , but even that is controversial .
the anniversary year was declared the " year of youth . "
but critics point out that over one-third of young israelis live below the poverty level - which is certainly nothing to celebrate . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .
the states of the arab league , which had been founded not long before , hoped to exterminate the new entity they believed the west had brought upon them - the british with the balfour declaration , in which they promised the jews support in the establishment of a national homeland in 1917 ; the un with its 1947 partition plan for palestine ; and the united states with its active support for the foundation of the state of israel .

israel expanded its territory even beyond the lines of the partition .
more than 750,000 palestinians were forced to leave their homes - out of fear for their lives or because they were expelled .
they remain the central problem in the conflict 60 years later - and their numbers have grown to around 4 million . the 1948 defeat affected the arabs - indeed the whole muslim world - deeply .
they were unwilling to accept the result and vowed vengeance .
and because the arabs were loath to admit their defeat at the hands of the tiny jewish state , they held the west responsible for it .
thus , the legend arose that nurtures radical groups and demagogues to this day : israel as the outpost of an anti-arabic and anti-islamic west in the middle east , just as the crusaders were hundreds of years ago . common cause israel 's enemies believe they have repeatedly seen their thesis confirmed .
in 1956 , they saw as confirmation that israel , france and britain joined forces in the suez crisis .
the europeans were concerned about the suez canal , while the israelis wanted to ensure the security of their border to egypt .
during the cold war , egypt , syria and iraq became allies with moscow , which strengthened all the more the connection between the us and israel and conservative arab states .

jordan and syria 's intervention was no help to cairo .
within six days , israel had seized the entire sinai peninsula , the gaza strip , the west bank and the golan heights . suddenly israel controlled all of historic palestine .
some israelis were hopeful that a call would come from amman or cairo offering peace in exchange for occupied territory .
but the telephone did n't ring .
instead , in khartoum , the arab league declared its " three no 's " : no peace with israel , no recognition of israel , no negotiations with israel . peace with the arch-enemy in the 1973 yom kippur war , the arabs succeeded in improving their damaged self-confidence , with syria and egypt causing heavy damage to israel .
but the war ended without victors .

it was n't until 15 years later , in 1993 , that israel and the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- under yasser arafat agreed on the oslo peace plan , which was meant to lead to israel pulling out of the occupied territories and the foundation of a palestinian state .
finally the most important palestinian groups were willing to accept the two-state solution recommended by the un partition plan 46 years previously . rabin 's assassination but resistance came from the israeli side too .
likud party nationalists under benjamin netanyahu denounced what they said was a betrayal of the historic homeland , as they viewed all of palestine as eretz yisrael , belonging to the land of israel .
they warned against the dangers for israel of giving up the occupied territories . in november 1995 prime minister yitzhak rabin , who had signed the oslo accords , was assassinated .
the following year , netanyahu was elected prime minister , and israel began to sabotage the implementation of the oslo plan .

in autumn 2000 the second intifada started .

at the same time , those opposed to any kind of settlement gained ever more influence .
in early 2006 , hamas won elections in the palestinian territories .

" this can not be the model for us , " steinmeier , who under former chancellor gerhard schroeder strongly opposed the iraq war , said . evolving threats leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have proposed setting up a german version of the us nsc . in a joint draft strategy paper , they argue that the new council would serve as a " political analysis , coordination and decision-making center " in the face of evolving threats . the paper calls for a concentration of all forces to secure both internal and external security in a national security council under the chairmanship of the german chancellor .
the proposal includes deploying the bundeswehr or german army within german borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party says global terrorism poses unforeseen threats " the threat of global terrorism makes it important that we get past the traditional division of domestic and foreign security , " volker kauder , the conservatives ' parliamentary leader , told the welt am sonntag paper over the weekend .
" ensuring the supply of energy and raw materials is another important security policy point . " on monday , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a news conference that chancellor merkel supported the creation of the nsc . social democrats cry foul however , senior social democrats who share power in an uneasy grand coalition government with the cdu have criticized the plan , arguing it 's a thinly-veiled attempt at wresting policy away from the foreign ministry led by steinmeier . peter struck , head of the spd group in parliament , said the nsc was totally superfluous . " these plans have to be taken off the table , " spd foreign policy expert gert weisskirchen told the tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he added that there " absolutely no need " to relocate foreign policy decisions from the foreign ministry to the chancellery , as the plan reportedly calls for . opposition remains sceptical the proposal has also been slammed by opposition parties . the head of the free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , told the schleswig-holstein am sonntag newspaper he thought the cdu / csu plan could " massively shift - and damage - our foreign policy . "
he said he also feared the proposal could be used as an initial step in allowing the domestic deployment of the germany army , a plan which the fdp has long rejected . claudia roth , head of the greens said the nsc proposal redefined the duties of the german army in a " dramatic fashion . " " the conservatives want to send german soldiers to wars for oil and water .
that ca n't be the answer to global crises and global warming , " roth told german news agency dpa . german media has reported the conservatives planned to present their report to party members on tuesday and the entire bundestag on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.05.2008 germany 's middle class shrinking fast , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany 's future feature more homeless on the streets ?
a new study has found that by the year 2020 , the number of people belonging to germany 's middle class could fall below 50 percent of the population if economic growth rates do n't increase substantially . the study , by the consulting group mckinsey , found that in 12 years , 10 million fewer people could belong to the middle class than did at the beginning of the 1990s if economic growth levels do not surpass the forecast 1.7 percent , according to the german newspaper welt am sonntag , which had seen the report . " the economic growth that we have experienced over the past 15 years has not been enough to reach the citizens , " frank mattern , head of mckinsey 's germany operations , told the newspaper .
" for people in the middle-income range , small growth rates are equivalent to losses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endangered species ?
for the report , called " germany 2020 , " people are considered middle class if they earn between 70 and 150 percent of the average yearly wage in germany , which according to mckinsey in 2006 was around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,515 -rrb- . the researchers painted two scenarios for germany .
in the first , economic growth would proceed as predicted and almost 30 percent of germans would fall out of the middle class . a second , more positive scenario has the german economy growing at a more dynamic rate , around three percent annually .
according to that forecast , average per capita income could rise some 40 from 2006 to around 36,000 euros .
mckinsey based its calculations , according to the article , on research into eleven industrial sectors which make up more than 50 percent of the german economy . the last time germany experienced growth rates of three percent was in the middle of the 1980s , but mckinsey researchers have said reaching those levels again is not unrealistic . " we are proceeding on the assumption that we can reach a growth rate of three percent and well before 2020 , " mattern said .
" the world economy is growing at four percent . " the ends are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rich are getting richer the numbers correspond to a report put out the diw economics institute at the beginning of march that found the group of middle-income earners was shrinking while substantial growth was occurring at the two ends of the income spectrum : the rich and the poor . while the number of middle-income earners remained stable from 1992 to 2000 at 62 percent of the population , it had fallen to 54 percent by 2006 , researchers found .
that corresponds to a decrease from 49 to 44 million people in the middle-income range . in the period from 1996 to 2006 , the number of wealthy people earning more than 200 percent of the average income level went from 6.4 to 9.2 percent and the number of poor earning less than 50 percent of the average increased from 7.3 to 11.4 percent . old-age poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly is a big concern for women according to a survey by the emnid research institute published in the bild am sonntag newspaper , almost three-quarters of germans think that in a few years , poverty among the elderly will be the biggest problem the country faces . the poll found that 73 percent thought the days of expecting a comfortable retirement with a state-provided pension were soon to be a thing of the past .
the concern is especially acute among women and those between 50 and 64 years of age , the paper said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new study has found that by the year 2020 , the number of people belonging to germany 's middle class could fall below 50 percent of the population if economic growth rates do n't increase substantially . the study , by the consulting group mckinsey , found that in 12 years , 10 million fewer people could belong to the middle class than did at the beginning of the 1990s if economic growth levels do not surpass the forecast 1.7 percent , according to the german newspaper welt am sonntag , which had seen the report . " the economic growth that we have experienced over the past 15 years has not been enough to reach the citizens , " frank mattern , head of mckinsey 's germany operations , told the newspaper .
" for people in the middle-income range , small growth rates are equivalent to losses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endangered species ?
for the report , called " germany 2020 , " people are considered middle class if they earn between 70 and 150 percent of the average yearly wage in germany , which according to mckinsey in 2006 was around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,515 -rrb- . the researchers painted two scenarios for germany .
in the first , economic growth would proceed as predicted and almost 30 percent of germans would fall out of the middle class . a second , more positive scenario has the german economy growing at a more dynamic rate , around three percent annually .
according to that forecast , average per capita income could rise some 40 from 2006 to around 36,000 euros .
mckinsey based its calculations , according to the article , on research into eleven industrial sectors which make up more than 50 percent of the german economy . the last time germany experienced growth rates of three percent was in the middle of the 1980s , but mckinsey researchers have said reaching those levels again is not unrealistic . " we are proceeding on the assumption that we can reach a growth rate of three percent and well before 2020 , " mattern said .
" the world economy is growing at four percent . " the ends are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rich are getting richer the numbers correspond to a report put out the diw economics institute at the beginning of march that found the group of middle-income earners was shrinking while substantial growth was occurring at the two ends of the income spectrum : the rich and the poor . while the number of middle-income earners remained stable from 1992 to 2000 at 62 percent of the population , it had fallen to 54 percent by 2006 , researchers found .
that corresponds to a decrease from 49 to 44 million people in the middle-income range . in the period from 1996 to 2006 , the number of wealthy people earning more than 200 percent of the average income level went from 6.4 to 9.2 percent and the number of poor earning less than 50 percent of the average increased from 7.3 to 11.4 percent . old-age poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly is a big concern for women according to a survey by the emnid research institute published in the bild am sonntag newspaper , almost three-quarters of germans think that in a few years , poverty among the elderly will be the biggest problem the country faces . the poll found that 73 percent thought the days of expecting a comfortable retirement with a state-provided pension were soon to be a thing of the past .

" this can not be the model for us , " steinmeier , who under former chancellor gerhard schroeder strongly opposed the iraq war , said . evolving threats leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have proposed setting up a german version of the us nsc . in a joint draft strategy paper , they argue that the new council would serve as a " political analysis , coordination and decision-making center " in the face of evolving threats . the paper calls for a concentration of all forces to secure both internal and external security in a national security council under the chairmanship of the german chancellor .
the proposal includes deploying the bundeswehr or german army within german borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party says global terrorism poses unforeseen threats " the threat of global terrorism makes it important that we get past the traditional division of domestic and foreign security , " volker kauder , the conservatives ' parliamentary leader , told the welt am sonntag paper over the weekend .
" ensuring the supply of energy and raw materials is another important security policy point . " on monday , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a news conference that chancellor merkel supported the creation of the nsc . social democrats cry foul however , senior social democrats who share power in an uneasy grand coalition government with the cdu have criticized the plan , arguing it 's a thinly-veiled attempt at wresting policy away from the foreign ministry led by steinmeier . peter struck , head of the spd group in parliament , said the nsc was totally superfluous . " these plans have to be taken off the table , " spd foreign policy expert gert weisskirchen told the tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he added that there " absolutely no need " to relocate foreign policy decisions from the foreign ministry to the chancellery , as the plan reportedly calls for . opposition remains sceptical the proposal has also been slammed by opposition parties . the head of the free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , told the schleswig-holstein am sonntag newspaper he thought the cdu / csu plan could " massively shift - and damage - our foreign policy . "
he said he also feared the proposal could be used as an initial step in allowing the domestic deployment of the germany army , a plan which the fdp has long rejected . claudia roth , head of the greens said the nsc proposal redefined the duties of the german army in a " dramatic fashion . " " the conservatives want to send german soldiers to wars for oil and water .
that ca n't be the answer to global crises and global warming , " roth told german news agency dpa . german media has reported the conservatives planned to present their report to party members on tuesday and the entire bundestag on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" these plans have to be taken off the table , " spd foreign policy expert gert weisskirchen told the tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he added that there " absolutely no need " to relocate foreign policy decisions from the foreign ministry to the chancellery , as the plan reportedly calls for . opposition remains sceptical the proposal has also been slammed by opposition parties . the head of the free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , told the schleswig-holstein am sonntag newspaper he thought the cdu / csu plan could " massively shift - and damage - our foreign policy . "
he said he also feared the proposal could be used as an initial step in allowing the domestic deployment of the germany army , a plan which the fdp has long rejected . claudia roth , head of the greens said the nsc proposal redefined the duties of the german army in a " dramatic fashion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : israel turns 60 : the making of a country german-israeli relations : the normality of abnormality israel remembers victims of holocaust in annual ceremony german jews keep up the culture in israel 's old folks homes opinion : anniversary represents time to mourn missed chances middle east -pipe- 05.05.2008 israel 's history : history of a conflict großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the land of israel has been in dispute since before the state was even founded may 14 marks the 60th anniversary of the founding of the state of israel .
while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .
the states of the arab league , which had been founded not long before , hoped to exterminate the new entity they believed the west had brought upon them - the british with the balfour declaration , in which they promised the jews support in the establishment of a national homeland in 1917 ; the un with its 1947 partition plan for palestine ; and the united states with its active support for the foundation of the state of israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1973 : general moshe dayan -lrb- l . -rrb- with ariel sharon on the egyptian side of the suez canal against all expectations , the arab plan failed .
israel expanded its territory even beyond the lines of the partition .
more than 750,000 palestinians were forced to leave their homes - out of fear for their lives or because they were expelled .
they remain the central problem in the conflict 60 years later - and their numbers have grown to around 4 million . the 1948 defeat affected the arabs - indeed the whole muslim world - deeply .
they were unwilling to accept the result and vowed vengeance .
and because the arabs were loath to admit their defeat at the hands of the tiny jewish state , they held the west responsible for it .
thus , the legend arose that nurtures radical groups and demagogues to this day : israel as the outpost of an anti-arabic and anti-islamic west in the middle east , just as the crusaders were hundreds of years ago . common cause israel 's enemies believe they have repeatedly seen their thesis confirmed .
in 1956 , they saw as confirmation that israel , france and britain joined forces in the suez crisis .
the europeans were concerned about the suez canal , while the israelis wanted to ensure the security of their border to egypt .
during the cold war , egypt , syria and iraq became allies with moscow , which strengthened all the more the connection between the us and israel and conservative arab states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1977 : israel 's menachem begin whispers to egypt 's anwar sadat the most important change came after the six-day war in june 1967 .

a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .

they were unwilling to accept the result and vowed vengeance .
and because the arabs were loath to admit their defeat at the hands of the tiny jewish state , they held the west responsible for it .
thus , the legend arose that nurtures radical groups and demagogues to this day : israel as the outpost of an anti-arabic and anti-islamic west in the middle east , just as the crusaders were hundreds of years ago . common cause israel 's enemies believe they have repeatedly seen their thesis confirmed .
in 1956 , they saw as confirmation that israel , france and britain joined forces in the suez crisis .

a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .

israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .

a new study has found that by the year 2020 , the number of people belonging to germany 's middle class could fall below 50 percent of the population if economic growth rates do n't increase substantially . the study , by the consulting group mckinsey , found that in 12 years , 10 million fewer people could belong to the middle class than did at the beginning of the 1990s if economic growth levels do not surpass the forecast 1.7 percent , according to the german newspaper welt am sonntag , which had seen the report . " the economic growth that we have experienced over the past 15 years has not been enough to reach the citizens , " frank mattern , head of mckinsey 's germany operations , told the newspaper .
" for people in the middle-income range , small growth rates are equivalent to losses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endangered species ?
for the report , called " germany 2020 , " people are considered middle class if they earn between 70 and 150 percent of the average yearly wage in germany , which according to mckinsey in 2006 was around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,515 -rrb- . the researchers painted two scenarios for germany .
in the first , economic growth would proceed as predicted and almost 30 percent of germans would fall out of the middle class . a second , more positive scenario has the german economy growing at a more dynamic rate , around three percent annually .
according to that forecast , average per capita income could rise some 40 from 2006 to around 36,000 euros .
mckinsey based its calculations , according to the article , on research into eleven industrial sectors which make up more than 50 percent of the german economy . the last time germany experienced growth rates of three percent was in the middle of the 1980s , but mckinsey researchers have said reaching those levels again is not unrealistic . " we are proceeding on the assumption that we can reach a growth rate of three percent and well before 2020 , " mattern said .
" the world economy is growing at four percent . " the ends are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rich are getting richer the numbers correspond to a report put out the diw economics institute at the beginning of march that found the group of middle-income earners was shrinking while substantial growth was occurring at the two ends of the income spectrum : the rich and the poor . while the number of middle-income earners remained stable from 1992 to 2000 at 62 percent of the population , it had fallen to 54 percent by 2006 , researchers found .
that corresponds to a decrease from 49 to 44 million people in the middle-income range . in the period from 1996 to 2006 , the number of wealthy people earning more than 200 percent of the average income level went from 6.4 to 9.2 percent and the number of poor earning less than 50 percent of the average increased from 7.3 to 11.4 percent . old-age poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly is a big concern for women according to a survey by the emnid research institute published in the bild am sonntag newspaper , almost three-quarters of germans think that in a few years , poverty among the elderly will be the biggest problem the country faces . the poll found that 73 percent thought the days of expecting a comfortable retirement with a state-provided pension were soon to be a thing of the past .

iran has been criticized for its increasing use of the death penalty . the european union urged iran to comply with international law and not go forward with the planned execution of behnoud shojaee .
the young man was 17 when he stabbed another boy with a piece of glass during a fight .
the european union also called for iran to also stop plans to execute " all other juvenile offenders on death row . "
iran has executed at least 28 child offenders since 1990 and has another 86 children on death row , according to the human rights group amnesty international .
slovenia , which currently hold the rotating eu presidency , said that the juvenile death sentences breach iran 's international obligations .
" the presidency of the eu is deeply concerned by the news of the imminent execution of behnoud shojaee , " according to the statement released sunday , may 4 .
shojaee 's execution is planned for wednesday , according to amnesty international .
shojaee is 20 , but was 17 at the time of his crime .

yet everything is not as rosy as it might appear , says deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel . russian rulers have a soft spot for political symbolism , and there will be plenty of it on display this week .
the eight-year presidency of vladimir putin will come to an end on wednesday , may 7 , with dmitry medvedev taking over russia 's highest public office .
the day after the president 's inauguration , putin will be confirmed as prime minister by the duma . if the inauguration and the successful handover in the kremlin were n't enough , on friday , celebrations will get underway for the most important national holiday in modern russian history .
victory over nazi germany in world war ii will be observed with parades and pathos . it 's difficult to imagine a more grandiose finale to " operation successor . " putin 's sweeping success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel you have to hand it to vladimir putin .
he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "
the " tandem democracy " of medvedev as president and putin as head of government is supposed to protect political and economic stability .
both ceaselessly repeated that they are doing it to help further modernize the country . but it 's questionable whether the new double rule of putin and medvedev can ensure political stability . in russian history , " dual power " brings instability .
the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .
at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .
and even more important is to know whether they will both adhere to this arrangement over the long term .
if not , stability and continuity will give way to friction and instability . ingo mannteufel is head of the russian section of dw-radio and dw-world.de. -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : russia gets a new president profile : dmitry medvedev europe offers congratulations and criticism to medvedev dealing with medvedev wo n't be easier , putin warns merkel medvedev wins election amid accusations of voter intimidation russia -pipe- 05.05.2008 opinion : russia 's power duo offers tenuous political stability großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an action-packed week in russian politics with dmitry medvedev and vladimir putin taking up their respective offices .
yet everything is not as rosy as it might appear , says deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel . russian rulers have a soft spot for political symbolism , and there will be plenty of it on display this week .
the eight-year presidency of vladimir putin will come to an end on wednesday , may 7 , with dmitry medvedev taking over russia 's highest public office .
the day after the president 's inauguration , putin will be confirmed as prime minister by the duma . if the inauguration and the successful handover in the kremlin were n't enough , on friday , celebrations will get underway for the most important national holiday in modern russian history .
victory over nazi germany in world war ii will be observed with parades and pathos . it 's difficult to imagine a more grandiose finale to " operation successor . " putin 's sweeping success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel you have to hand it to vladimir putin .
he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "
the " tandem democracy " of medvedev as president and putin as head of government is supposed to protect political and economic stability .
both ceaselessly repeated that they are doing it to help further modernize the country . but it 's questionable whether the new double rule of putin and medvedev can ensure political stability . in russian history , " dual power " brings instability .
the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .
at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .
and even more important is to know whether they will both adhere to this arrangement over the long term .
if not , stability and continuity will give way to friction and instability . ingo mannteufel is head of the russian section of dw-radio and dw-world.de. -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet everything is not as rosy as it might appear , says deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel . russian rulers have a soft spot for political symbolism , and there will be plenty of it on display this week .
the eight-year presidency of vladimir putin will come to an end on wednesday , may 7 , with dmitry medvedev taking over russia 's highest public office .
the day after the president 's inauguration , putin will be confirmed as prime minister by the duma . if the inauguration and the successful handover in the kremlin were n't enough , on friday , celebrations will get underway for the most important national holiday in modern russian history .
victory over nazi germany in world war ii will be observed with parades and pathos . it 's difficult to imagine a more grandiose finale to " operation successor . " putin 's sweeping success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel you have to hand it to vladimir putin .
he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "
the " tandem democracy " of medvedev as president and putin as head of government is supposed to protect political and economic stability .
both ceaselessly repeated that they are doing it to help further modernize the country . but it 's questionable whether the new double rule of putin and medvedev can ensure political stability . in russian history , " dual power " brings instability .
the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .
at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .
and even more important is to know whether they will both adhere to this arrangement over the long term .
if not , stability and continuity will give way to friction and instability . ingo mannteufel is head of the russian section of dw-radio and dw-world.de. -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

victory over nazi germany in world war ii will be observed with parades and pathos . it 's difficult to imagine a more grandiose finale to " operation successor . " putin 's sweeping success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel you have to hand it to vladimir putin .
he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "
the " tandem democracy " of medvedev as president and putin as head of government is supposed to protect political and economic stability .
both ceaselessly repeated that they are doing it to help further modernize the country . but it 's questionable whether the new double rule of putin and medvedev can ensure political stability . in russian history , " dual power " brings instability .
the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .
at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .
and even more important is to know whether they will both adhere to this arrangement over the long term .
if not , stability and continuity will give way to friction and instability . ingo mannteufel is head of the russian section of dw-radio and dw-world.de. -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.05.2008 germany 's middle class shrinking fast , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany 's future feature more homeless on the streets ?
a new study has found that by the year 2020 , the number of people belonging to germany 's middle class could fall below 50 percent of the population if economic growth rates do n't increase substantially . the study , by the consulting group mckinsey , found that in 12 years , 10 million fewer people could belong to the middle class than did at the beginning of the 1990s if economic growth levels do not surpass the forecast 1.7 percent , according to the german newspaper welt am sonntag , which had seen the report . " the economic growth that we have experienced over the past 15 years has not been enough to reach the citizens , " frank mattern , head of mckinsey 's germany operations , told the newspaper .
" for people in the middle-income range , small growth rates are equivalent to losses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endangered species ?
for the report , called " germany 2020 , " people are considered middle class if they earn between 70 and 150 percent of the average yearly wage in germany , which according to mckinsey in 2006 was around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,515 -rrb- . the researchers painted two scenarios for germany .
in the first , economic growth would proceed as predicted and almost 30 percent of germans would fall out of the middle class . a second , more positive scenario has the german economy growing at a more dynamic rate , around three percent annually .
according to that forecast , average per capita income could rise some 40 from 2006 to around 36,000 euros .
mckinsey based its calculations , according to the article , on research into eleven industrial sectors which make up more than 50 percent of the german economy . the last time germany experienced growth rates of three percent was in the middle of the 1980s , but mckinsey researchers have said reaching those levels again is not unrealistic . " we are proceeding on the assumption that we can reach a growth rate of three percent and well before 2020 , " mattern said .
" the world economy is growing at four percent . " the ends are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rich are getting richer the numbers correspond to a report put out the diw economics institute at the beginning of march that found the group of middle-income earners was shrinking while substantial growth was occurring at the two ends of the income spectrum : the rich and the poor . while the number of middle-income earners remained stable from 1992 to 2000 at 62 percent of the population , it had fallen to 54 percent by 2006 , researchers found .
that corresponds to a decrease from 49 to 44 million people in the middle-income range . in the period from 1996 to 2006 , the number of wealthy people earning more than 200 percent of the average income level went from 6.4 to 9.2 percent and the number of poor earning less than 50 percent of the average increased from 7.3 to 11.4 percent . old-age poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly is a big concern for women according to a survey by the emnid research institute published in the bild am sonntag newspaper , almost three-quarters of germans think that in a few years , poverty among the elderly will be the biggest problem the country faces . the poll found that 73 percent thought the days of expecting a comfortable retirement with a state-provided pension were soon to be a thing of the past .

iran has been criticized for its increasing use of the death penalty . the european union urged iran to comply with international law and not go forward with the planned execution of behnoud shojaee .
the young man was 17 when he stabbed another boy with a piece of glass during a fight .
the european union also called for iran to also stop plans to execute " all other juvenile offenders on death row . "
iran has executed at least 28 child offenders since 1990 and has another 86 children on death row , according to the human rights group amnesty international .
slovenia , which currently hold the rotating eu presidency , said that the juvenile death sentences breach iran 's international obligations .
" the presidency of the eu is deeply concerned by the news of the imminent execution of behnoud shojaee , " according to the statement released sunday , may 4 .
shojaee 's execution is planned for wednesday , according to amnesty international .
shojaee is 20 , but was 17 at the time of his crime .
he allegedly stepped into a fight between a friend and another boy and ended up stabbing the other boy once with a shard of glass after being threatened with a knife .
executions on the rise in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants iran to give juvenile offenders a break iran has carried out numerous other executions in recent days , hanging a dozen convicted criminals , according to media reports .
at least one drug trafficker was hanged in public , an iranian newspaper report from monday said .
iran carried out 86 executions in 2008 , according to a count by the news agency afp .
amnesty international reported that in 2007 iran used the death penalty more than any other country apart from china , executing 317 people .
that was a sharp increase from the 177 executions carried out in 2006 .
iran classes murder , rape , armed robbery , drug trafficking and adultery as capital offenses .
human rights groups have accused iran of making excessive use of the death penalty , but tehran defends the practice as an effective deterrent carried out after an extensive judicial process .
all 27 eu states have abolished the death penalty and the eu has led calls for an international moratorium on the practice . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet everything is not as rosy as it might appear , says deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel . russian rulers have a soft spot for political symbolism , and there will be plenty of it on display this week .
the eight-year presidency of vladimir putin will come to an end on wednesday , may 7 , with dmitry medvedev taking over russia 's highest public office .
the day after the president 's inauguration , putin will be confirmed as prime minister by the duma . if the inauguration and the successful handover in the kremlin were n't enough , on friday , celebrations will get underway for the most important national holiday in modern russian history .
victory over nazi germany in world war ii will be observed with parades and pathos . it 's difficult to imagine a more grandiose finale to " operation successor . " putin 's sweeping success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel you have to hand it to vladimir putin .
he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "
the " tandem democracy " of medvedev as president and putin as head of government is supposed to protect political and economic stability .
both ceaselessly repeated that they are doing it to help further modernize the country . but it 's questionable whether the new double rule of putin and medvedev can ensure political stability . in russian history , " dual power " brings instability .
the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .
at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .
and even more important is to know whether they will both adhere to this arrangement over the long term .
if not , stability and continuity will give way to friction and instability . ingo mannteufel is head of the russian section of dw-radio and dw-world.de. -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet everything is not as rosy as it might appear , says deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel . russian rulers have a soft spot for political symbolism , and there will be plenty of it on display this week .
the eight-year presidency of vladimir putin will come to an end on wednesday , may 7 , with dmitry medvedev taking over russia 's highest public office .
the day after the president 's inauguration , putin will be confirmed as prime minister by the duma . if the inauguration and the successful handover in the kremlin were n't enough , on friday , celebrations will get underway for the most important national holiday in modern russian history .
victory over nazi germany in world war ii will be observed with parades and pathos . it 's difficult to imagine a more grandiose finale to " operation successor . " putin 's sweeping success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel you have to hand it to vladimir putin .
he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "
the " tandem democracy " of medvedev as president and putin as head of government is supposed to protect political and economic stability .
both ceaselessly repeated that they are doing it to help further modernize the country . but it 's questionable whether the new double rule of putin and medvedev can ensure political stability . in russian history , " dual power " brings instability .
the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .

iran has been criticized for its increasing use of the death penalty . the european union urged iran to comply with international law and not go forward with the planned execution of behnoud shojaee .
the young man was 17 when he stabbed another boy with a piece of glass during a fight .
the european union also called for iran to also stop plans to execute " all other juvenile offenders on death row . "
iran has executed at least 28 child offenders since 1990 and has another 86 children on death row , according to the human rights group amnesty international .
slovenia , which currently hold the rotating eu presidency , said that the juvenile death sentences breach iran 's international obligations .
" the presidency of the eu is deeply concerned by the news of the imminent execution of behnoud shojaee , " according to the statement released sunday , may 4 .
shojaee 's execution is planned for wednesday , according to amnesty international .

iran has been criticized for its increasing use of the death penalty . the european union urged iran to comply with international law and not go forward with the planned execution of behnoud shojaee .
the young man was 17 when he stabbed another boy with a piece of glass during a fight .
the european union also called for iran to also stop plans to execute " all other juvenile offenders on death row . "
iran has executed at least 28 child offenders since 1990 and has another 86 children on death row , according to the human rights group amnesty international .
slovenia , which currently hold the rotating eu presidency , said that the juvenile death sentences breach iran 's international obligations .
" the presidency of the eu is deeply concerned by the news of the imminent execution of behnoud shojaee , " according to the statement released sunday , may 4 .
shojaee 's execution is planned for wednesday , according to amnesty international .
shojaee is 20 , but was 17 at the time of his crime .

iran carried out 86 executions in 2008 , according to a count by the news agency afp .

that was a sharp increase from the 177 executions carried out in 2006 .
iran classes murder , rape , armed robbery , drug trafficking and adultery as capital offenses .
human rights groups have accused iran of making excessive use of the death penalty , but tehran defends the practice as an effective deterrent carried out after an extensive judicial process .

while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .
the states of the arab league , which had been founded not long before , hoped to exterminate the new entity they believed the west had brought upon them - the british with the balfour declaration , in which they promised the jews support in the establishment of a national homeland in 1917 ; the un with its 1947 partition plan for palestine ; and the united states with its active support for the foundation of the state of israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1973 : general moshe dayan -lrb- l . -rrb- with ariel sharon on the egyptian side of the suez canal against all expectations , the arab plan failed .
israel expanded its territory even beyond the lines of the partition .
more than 750,000 palestinians were forced to leave their homes - out of fear for their lives or because they were expelled .
they remain the central problem in the conflict 60 years later - and their numbers have grown to around 4 million . the 1948 defeat affected the arabs - indeed the whole muslim world - deeply .
they were unwilling to accept the result and vowed vengeance .
and because the arabs were loath to admit their defeat at the hands of the tiny jewish state , they held the west responsible for it .
thus , the legend arose that nurtures radical groups and demagogues to this day : israel as the outpost of an anti-arabic and anti-islamic west in the middle east , just as the crusaders were hundreds of years ago . common cause israel 's enemies believe they have repeatedly seen their thesis confirmed .
in 1956 , they saw as confirmation that israel , france and britain joined forces in the suez crisis .
the europeans were concerned about the suez canal , while the israelis wanted to ensure the security of their border to egypt .
during the cold war , egypt , syria and iraq became allies with moscow , which strengthened all the more the connection between the us and israel and conservative arab states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1977 : israel 's menachem begin whispers to egypt 's anwar sadat the most important change came after the six-day war in june 1967 .
despite israeli warnings , egyptian president gamal abdel nasser closed the straits of tiran , giving israel an excuse for a preventive strike .
jordan and syria 's intervention was no help to cairo .
within six days , israel had seized the entire sinai peninsula , the gaza strip , the west bank and the golan heights . suddenly israel controlled all of historic palestine .
some israelis were hopeful that a call would come from amman or cairo offering peace in exchange for occupied territory .
but the telephone did n't ring .
instead , in khartoum , the arab league declared its " three no 's " : no peace with israel , no recognition of israel , no negotiations with israel . peace with the arch-enemy in the 1973 yom kippur war , the arabs succeeded in improving their damaged self-confidence , with syria and egypt causing heavy damage to israel .
but the war ended without victors .
the new constellation , however , allowed egyptian president anwar sadat to start a peace initiative which culminated in the camp david accords between egypt and israel in 1978 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1993 : rabin and arafat sealed the peace deal at the white house the palestinians could have been part of the peace agreement , but with encouragement from the arab world , they rejected it .
it was n't until 15 years later , in 1993 , that israel and the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- under yasser arafat agreed on the oslo peace plan , which was meant to lead to israel pulling out of the occupied territories and the foundation of a palestinian state .
finally the most important palestinian groups were willing to accept the two-state solution recommended by the un partition plan 46 years previously . rabin 's assassination but resistance came from the israeli side too .
likud party nationalists under benjamin netanyahu denounced what they said was a betrayal of the historic homeland , as they viewed all of palestine as eretz yisrael , belonging to the land of israel .
they warned against the dangers for israel of giving up the occupied territories . in november 1995 prime minister yitzhak rabin , who had signed the oslo accords , was assassinated .
the following year , netanyahu was elected prime minister , and israel began to sabotage the implementation of the oslo plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1995 : rabin 's assassination by an israeli came as a shock growing dissatisfaction among palestinians added to the political crisis in israel .
in autumn 2000 the second intifada started .
in the course of the " al-aqsa intifada " nearly every positive development in the palestinian territories was destroyed : autonomous self-administration once again became occupied territories , and israel , under ariel sharon , started to close itself off from the palestinians behind a gigantic wall . no compromise it was only after arafat 's death , in november 2004 , and with great effort , that negotiations resumed , but they failed to bring results .
at the same time , those opposed to any kind of settlement gained ever more influence .
in early 2006 , hamas won elections in the palestinian territories .
the islamist group refused to recognize israel or the oslo accords , and the palestinians again became isolated , particularly from the west .
israel was intransigent , deciding to make no more compromises .
the situation in the gaza strip , which israel had evacuated , began to resemble war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a legacy of violence that us president george w. bush wanted to finish his last year in office with peace in the middle east made no difference .
there was nothing to indicate he would succeed . instead , the atmosphere among palestinians and israelis continues to deteriorate .
the palestinians fight among themselves .
israel intends to spend millions on celebrating the 60th anniversary of statehood , but even that is controversial .
the anniversary year was declared the " year of youth . "
but critics point out that over one-third of young israelis live below the poverty level - which is certainly nothing to celebrate . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "
the " tandem democracy " of medvedev as president and putin as head of government is supposed to protect political and economic stability .
both ceaselessly repeated that they are doing it to help further modernize the country . but it 's questionable whether the new double rule of putin and medvedev can ensure political stability . in russian history , " dual power " brings instability .
the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .
at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .

yet everything is not as rosy as it might appear , says deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel . russian rulers have a soft spot for political symbolism , and there will be plenty of it on display this week .
the eight-year presidency of vladimir putin will come to an end on wednesday , may 7 , with dmitry medvedev taking over russia 's highest public office .
the day after the president 's inauguration , putin will be confirmed as prime minister by the duma . if the inauguration and the successful handover in the kremlin were n't enough , on friday , celebrations will get underway for the most important national holiday in modern russian history .
victory over nazi germany in world war ii will be observed with parades and pathos . it 's difficult to imagine a more grandiose finale to " operation successor . " putin 's sweeping success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel you have to hand it to vladimir putin .
he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "
the " tandem democracy " of medvedev as president and putin as head of government is supposed to protect political and economic stability .
both ceaselessly repeated that they are doing it to help further modernize the country . but it 's questionable whether the new double rule of putin and medvedev can ensure political stability . in russian history , " dual power " brings instability .
the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .
at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .
and even more important is to know whether they will both adhere to this arrangement over the long term .
if not , stability and continuity will give way to friction and instability . ingo mannteufel is head of the russian section of dw-radio and dw-world.de. -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .
the states of the arab league , which had been founded not long before , hoped to exterminate the new entity they believed the west had brought upon them - the british with the balfour declaration , in which they promised the jews support in the establishment of a national homeland in 1917 ; the un with its 1947 partition plan for palestine ; and the united states with its active support for the foundation of the state of israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1973 : general moshe dayan -lrb- l . -rrb- with ariel sharon on the egyptian side of the suez canal against all expectations , the arab plan failed .
israel expanded its territory even beyond the lines of the partition .
more than 750,000 palestinians were forced to leave their homes - out of fear for their lives or because they were expelled .
they remain the central problem in the conflict 60 years later - and their numbers have grown to around 4 million . the 1948 defeat affected the arabs - indeed the whole muslim world - deeply .
they were unwilling to accept the result and vowed vengeance .
and because the arabs were loath to admit their defeat at the hands of the tiny jewish state , they held the west responsible for it .
thus , the legend arose that nurtures radical groups and demagogues to this day : israel as the outpost of an anti-arabic and anti-islamic west in the middle east , just as the crusaders were hundreds of years ago . common cause israel 's enemies believe they have repeatedly seen their thesis confirmed .
in 1956 , they saw as confirmation that israel , france and britain joined forces in the suez crisis .
the europeans were concerned about the suez canal , while the israelis wanted to ensure the security of their border to egypt .
during the cold war , egypt , syria and iraq became allies with moscow , which strengthened all the more the connection between the us and israel and conservative arab states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1977 : israel 's menachem begin whispers to egypt 's anwar sadat the most important change came after the six-day war in june 1967 .
despite israeli warnings , egyptian president gamal abdel nasser closed the straits of tiran , giving israel an excuse for a preventive strike .
jordan and syria 's intervention was no help to cairo .
within six days , israel had seized the entire sinai peninsula , the gaza strip , the west bank and the golan heights . suddenly israel controlled all of historic palestine .
some israelis were hopeful that a call would come from amman or cairo offering peace in exchange for occupied territory .
but the telephone did n't ring .
instead , in khartoum , the arab league declared its " three no 's " : no peace with israel , no recognition of israel , no negotiations with israel . peace with the arch-enemy in the 1973 yom kippur war , the arabs succeeded in improving their damaged self-confidence , with syria and egypt causing heavy damage to israel .
but the war ended without victors .
the new constellation , however , allowed egyptian president anwar sadat to start a peace initiative which culminated in the camp david accords between egypt and israel in 1978 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1993 : rabin and arafat sealed the peace deal at the white house the palestinians could have been part of the peace agreement , but with encouragement from the arab world , they rejected it .
it was n't until 15 years later , in 1993 , that israel and the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- under yasser arafat agreed on the oslo peace plan , which was meant to lead to israel pulling out of the occupied territories and the foundation of a palestinian state .
finally the most important palestinian groups were willing to accept the two-state solution recommended by the un partition plan 46 years previously . rabin 's assassination but resistance came from the israeli side too .
likud party nationalists under benjamin netanyahu denounced what they said was a betrayal of the historic homeland , as they viewed all of palestine as eretz yisrael , belonging to the land of israel .
they warned against the dangers for israel of giving up the occupied territories . in november 1995 prime minister yitzhak rabin , who had signed the oslo accords , was assassinated .
the following year , netanyahu was elected prime minister , and israel began to sabotage the implementation of the oslo plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1995 : rabin 's assassination by an israeli came as a shock growing dissatisfaction among palestinians added to the political crisis in israel .
in autumn 2000 the second intifada started .
in the course of the " al-aqsa intifada " nearly every positive development in the palestinian territories was destroyed : autonomous self-administration once again became occupied territories , and israel , under ariel sharon , started to close itself off from the palestinians behind a gigantic wall . no compromise it was only after arafat 's death , in november 2004 , and with great effort , that negotiations resumed , but they failed to bring results .
at the same time , those opposed to any kind of settlement gained ever more influence .
in early 2006 , hamas won elections in the palestinian territories .
the islamist group refused to recognize israel or the oslo accords , and the palestinians again became isolated , particularly from the west .
israel was intransigent , deciding to make no more compromises .
the situation in the gaza strip , which israel had evacuated , began to resemble war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a legacy of violence that us president george w. bush wanted to finish his last year in office with peace in the middle east made no difference .
there was nothing to indicate he would succeed . instead , the atmosphere among palestinians and israelis continues to deteriorate .
the palestinians fight among themselves .
israel intends to spend millions on celebrating the 60th anniversary of statehood , but even that is controversial .
the anniversary year was declared the " year of youth . "
but critics point out that over one-third of young israelis live below the poverty level - which is certainly nothing to celebrate . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .
the states of the arab league , which had been founded not long before , hoped to exterminate the new entity they believed the west had brought upon them - the british with the balfour declaration , in which they promised the jews support in the establishment of a national homeland in 1917 ; the un with its 1947 partition plan for palestine ; and the united states with its active support for the foundation of the state of israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1973 : general moshe dayan -lrb- l . -rrb- with ariel sharon on the egyptian side of the suez canal against all expectations , the arab plan failed .
israel expanded its territory even beyond the lines of the partition .
more than 750,000 palestinians were forced to leave their homes - out of fear for their lives or because they were expelled .
they remain the central problem in the conflict 60 years later - and their numbers have grown to around 4 million . the 1948 defeat affected the arabs - indeed the whole muslim world - deeply .
they were unwilling to accept the result and vowed vengeance .
and because the arabs were loath to admit their defeat at the hands of the tiny jewish state , they held the west responsible for it .
thus , the legend arose that nurtures radical groups and demagogues to this day : israel as the outpost of an anti-arabic and anti-islamic west in the middle east , just as the crusaders were hundreds of years ago . common cause israel 's enemies believe they have repeatedly seen their thesis confirmed .
in 1956 , they saw as confirmation that israel , france and britain joined forces in the suez crisis .
the europeans were concerned about the suez canal , while the israelis wanted to ensure the security of their border to egypt .
during the cold war , egypt , syria and iraq became allies with moscow , which strengthened all the more the connection between the us and israel and conservative arab states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1977 : israel 's menachem begin whispers to egypt 's anwar sadat the most important change came after the six-day war in june 1967 .
despite israeli warnings , egyptian president gamal abdel nasser closed the straits of tiran , giving israel an excuse for a preventive strike .
jordan and syria 's intervention was no help to cairo .
within six days , israel had seized the entire sinai peninsula , the gaza strip , the west bank and the golan heights . suddenly israel controlled all of historic palestine .
some israelis were hopeful that a call would come from amman or cairo offering peace in exchange for occupied territory .
but the telephone did n't ring .
instead , in khartoum , the arab league declared its " three no 's " : no peace with israel , no recognition of israel , no negotiations with israel . peace with the arch-enemy in the 1973 yom kippur war , the arabs succeeded in improving their damaged self-confidence , with syria and egypt causing heavy damage to israel .
but the war ended without victors .
the new constellation , however , allowed egyptian president anwar sadat to start a peace initiative which culminated in the camp david accords between egypt and israel in 1978 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1993 : rabin and arafat sealed the peace deal at the white house the palestinians could have been part of the peace agreement , but with encouragement from the arab world , they rejected it .
it was n't until 15 years later , in 1993 , that israel and the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- under yasser arafat agreed on the oslo peace plan , which was meant to lead to israel pulling out of the occupied territories and the foundation of a palestinian state .
finally the most important palestinian groups were willing to accept the two-state solution recommended by the un partition plan 46 years previously . rabin 's assassination but resistance came from the israeli side too .
likud party nationalists under benjamin netanyahu denounced what they said was a betrayal of the historic homeland , as they viewed all of palestine as eretz yisrael , belonging to the land of israel .
they warned against the dangers for israel of giving up the occupied territories . in november 1995 prime minister yitzhak rabin , who had signed the oslo accords , was assassinated .
the following year , netanyahu was elected prime minister , and israel began to sabotage the implementation of the oslo plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1995 : rabin 's assassination by an israeli came as a shock growing dissatisfaction among palestinians added to the political crisis in israel .
in autumn 2000 the second intifada started .
in the course of the " al-aqsa intifada " nearly every positive development in the palestinian territories was destroyed : autonomous self-administration once again became occupied territories , and israel , under ariel sharon , started to close itself off from the palestinians behind a gigantic wall . no compromise it was only after arafat 's death , in november 2004 , and with great effort , that negotiations resumed , but they failed to bring results .
at the same time , those opposed to any kind of settlement gained ever more influence .
in early 2006 , hamas won elections in the palestinian territories .
the islamist group refused to recognize israel or the oslo accords , and the palestinians again became isolated , particularly from the west .

a new study has found that by the year 2020 , the number of people belonging to germany 's middle class could fall below 50 percent of the population if economic growth rates do n't increase substantially . the study , by the consulting group mckinsey , found that in 12 years , 10 million fewer people could belong to the middle class than did at the beginning of the 1990s if economic growth levels do not surpass the forecast 1.7 percent , according to the german newspaper welt am sonntag , which had seen the report . " the economic growth that we have experienced over the past 15 years has not been enough to reach the citizens , " frank mattern , head of mckinsey 's germany operations , told the newspaper .
" for people in the middle-income range , small growth rates are equivalent to losses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endangered species ?
for the report , called " germany 2020 , " people are considered middle class if they earn between 70 and 150 percent of the average yearly wage in germany , which according to mckinsey in 2006 was around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,515 -rrb- . the researchers painted two scenarios for germany .
in the first , economic growth would proceed as predicted and almost 30 percent of germans would fall out of the middle class . a second , more positive scenario has the german economy growing at a more dynamic rate , around three percent annually .
according to that forecast , average per capita income could rise some 40 from 2006 to around 36,000 euros .
mckinsey based its calculations , according to the article , on research into eleven industrial sectors which make up more than 50 percent of the german economy . the last time germany experienced growth rates of three percent was in the middle of the 1980s , but mckinsey researchers have said reaching those levels again is not unrealistic . " we are proceeding on the assumption that we can reach a growth rate of three percent and well before 2020 , " mattern said .
" the world economy is growing at four percent . " the ends are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rich are getting richer the numbers correspond to a report put out the diw economics institute at the beginning of march that found the group of middle-income earners was shrinking while substantial growth was occurring at the two ends of the income spectrum : the rich and the poor . while the number of middle-income earners remained stable from 1992 to 2000 at 62 percent of the population , it had fallen to 54 percent by 2006 , researchers found .
that corresponds to a decrease from 49 to 44 million people in the middle-income range . in the period from 1996 to 2006 , the number of wealthy people earning more than 200 percent of the average income level went from 6.4 to 9.2 percent and the number of poor earning less than 50 percent of the average increased from 7.3 to 11.4 percent . old-age poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly is a big concern for women according to a survey by the emnid research institute published in the bild am sonntag newspaper , almost three-quarters of germans think that in a few years , poverty among the elderly will be the biggest problem the country faces . the poll found that 73 percent thought the days of expecting a comfortable retirement with a state-provided pension were soon to be a thing of the past .
the concern is especially acute among women and those between 50 and 64 years of age , the paper said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .
the states of the arab league , which had been founded not long before , hoped to exterminate the new entity they believed the west had brought upon them - the british with the balfour declaration , in which they promised the jews support in the establishment of a national homeland in 1917 ; the un with its 1947 partition plan for palestine ; and the united states with its active support for the foundation of the state of israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1973 : general moshe dayan -lrb- l . -rrb- with ariel sharon on the egyptian side of the suez canal against all expectations , the arab plan failed .
israel expanded its territory even beyond the lines of the partition .
more than 750,000 palestinians were forced to leave their homes - out of fear for their lives or because they were expelled .
they remain the central problem in the conflict 60 years later - and their numbers have grown to around 4 million . the 1948 defeat affected the arabs - indeed the whole muslim world - deeply .
they were unwilling to accept the result and vowed vengeance .
and because the arabs were loath to admit their defeat at the hands of the tiny jewish state , they held the west responsible for it .
thus , the legend arose that nurtures radical groups and demagogues to this day : israel as the outpost of an anti-arabic and anti-islamic west in the middle east , just as the crusaders were hundreds of years ago . common cause israel 's enemies believe they have repeatedly seen their thesis confirmed .
in 1956 , they saw as confirmation that israel , france and britain joined forces in the suez crisis .
the europeans were concerned about the suez canal , while the israelis wanted to ensure the security of their border to egypt .
during the cold war , egypt , syria and iraq became allies with moscow , which strengthened all the more the connection between the us and israel and conservative arab states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1977 : israel 's menachem begin whispers to egypt 's anwar sadat the most important change came after the six-day war in june 1967 .
despite israeli warnings , egyptian president gamal abdel nasser closed the straits of tiran , giving israel an excuse for a preventive strike .
jordan and syria 's intervention was no help to cairo .
within six days , israel had seized the entire sinai peninsula , the gaza strip , the west bank and the golan heights . suddenly israel controlled all of historic palestine .
some israelis were hopeful that a call would come from amman or cairo offering peace in exchange for occupied territory .
but the telephone did n't ring .
instead , in khartoum , the arab league declared its " three no 's " : no peace with israel , no recognition of israel , no negotiations with israel . peace with the arch-enemy in the 1973 yom kippur war , the arabs succeeded in improving their damaged self-confidence , with syria and egypt causing heavy damage to israel .
but the war ended without victors .
the new constellation , however , allowed egyptian president anwar sadat to start a peace initiative which culminated in the camp david accords between egypt and israel in 1978 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1993 : rabin and arafat sealed the peace deal at the white house the palestinians could have been part of the peace agreement , but with encouragement from the arab world , they rejected it .
it was n't until 15 years later , in 1993 , that israel and the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- under yasser arafat agreed on the oslo peace plan , which was meant to lead to israel pulling out of the occupied territories and the foundation of a palestinian state .
finally the most important palestinian groups were willing to accept the two-state solution recommended by the un partition plan 46 years previously . rabin 's assassination but resistance came from the israeli side too .
likud party nationalists under benjamin netanyahu denounced what they said was a betrayal of the historic homeland , as they viewed all of palestine as eretz yisrael , belonging to the land of israel .
they warned against the dangers for israel of giving up the occupied territories . in november 1995 prime minister yitzhak rabin , who had signed the oslo accords , was assassinated .
the following year , netanyahu was elected prime minister , and israel began to sabotage the implementation of the oslo plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1995 : rabin 's assassination by an israeli came as a shock growing dissatisfaction among palestinians added to the political crisis in israel .
in autumn 2000 the second intifada started .
in the course of the " al-aqsa intifada " nearly every positive development in the palestinian territories was destroyed : autonomous self-administration once again became occupied territories , and israel , under ariel sharon , started to close itself off from the palestinians behind a gigantic wall . no compromise it was only after arafat 's death , in november 2004 , and with great effort , that negotiations resumed , but they failed to bring results .
at the same time , those opposed to any kind of settlement gained ever more influence .
in early 2006 , hamas won elections in the palestinian territories .
the islamist group refused to recognize israel or the oslo accords , and the palestinians again became isolated , particularly from the west .
israel was intransigent , deciding to make no more compromises .
the situation in the gaza strip , which israel had evacuated , began to resemble war .

while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .
the states of the arab league , which had been founded not long before , hoped to exterminate the new entity they believed the west had brought upon them - the british with the balfour declaration , in which they promised the jews support in the establishment of a national homeland in 1917 ; the un with its 1947 partition plan for palestine ; and the united states with its active support for the foundation of the state of israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1973 : general moshe dayan -lrb- l . -rrb- with ariel sharon on the egyptian side of the suez canal against all expectations , the arab plan failed .
israel expanded its territory even beyond the lines of the partition .
more than 750,000 palestinians were forced to leave their homes - out of fear for their lives or because they were expelled .
they remain the central problem in the conflict 60 years later - and their numbers have grown to around 4 million . the 1948 defeat affected the arabs - indeed the whole muslim world - deeply .
they were unwilling to accept the result and vowed vengeance .
and because the arabs were loath to admit their defeat at the hands of the tiny jewish state , they held the west responsible for it .
thus , the legend arose that nurtures radical groups and demagogues to this day : israel as the outpost of an anti-arabic and anti-islamic west in the middle east , just as the crusaders were hundreds of years ago . common cause israel 's enemies believe they have repeatedly seen their thesis confirmed .
in 1956 , they saw as confirmation that israel , france and britain joined forces in the suez crisis .
the europeans were concerned about the suez canal , while the israelis wanted to ensure the security of their border to egypt .
during the cold war , egypt , syria and iraq became allies with moscow , which strengthened all the more the connection between the us and israel and conservative arab states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1977 : israel 's menachem begin whispers to egypt 's anwar sadat the most important change came after the six-day war in june 1967 .
despite israeli warnings , egyptian president gamal abdel nasser closed the straits of tiran , giving israel an excuse for a preventive strike .
jordan and syria 's intervention was no help to cairo .
within six days , israel had seized the entire sinai peninsula , the gaza strip , the west bank and the golan heights . suddenly israel controlled all of historic palestine .
some israelis were hopeful that a call would come from amman or cairo offering peace in exchange for occupied territory .
but the telephone did n't ring .
instead , in khartoum , the arab league declared its " three no 's " : no peace with israel , no recognition of israel , no negotiations with israel . peace with the arch-enemy in the 1973 yom kippur war , the arabs succeeded in improving their damaged self-confidence , with syria and egypt causing heavy damage to israel .
but the war ended without victors .
the new constellation , however , allowed egyptian president anwar sadat to start a peace initiative which culminated in the camp david accords between egypt and israel in 1978 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1993 : rabin and arafat sealed the peace deal at the white house the palestinians could have been part of the peace agreement , but with encouragement from the arab world , they rejected it .
it was n't until 15 years later , in 1993 , that israel and the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- under yasser arafat agreed on the oslo peace plan , which was meant to lead to israel pulling out of the occupied territories and the foundation of a palestinian state .
finally the most important palestinian groups were willing to accept the two-state solution recommended by the un partition plan 46 years previously . rabin 's assassination but resistance came from the israeli side too .
likud party nationalists under benjamin netanyahu denounced what they said was a betrayal of the historic homeland , as they viewed all of palestine as eretz yisrael , belonging to the land of israel .
they warned against the dangers for israel of giving up the occupied territories . in november 1995 prime minister yitzhak rabin , who had signed the oslo accords , was assassinated .
the following year , netanyahu was elected prime minister , and israel began to sabotage the implementation of the oslo plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1995 : rabin 's assassination by an israeli came as a shock growing dissatisfaction among palestinians added to the political crisis in israel .
in autumn 2000 the second intifada started .
in the course of the " al-aqsa intifada " nearly every positive development in the palestinian territories was destroyed : autonomous self-administration once again became occupied territories , and israel , under ariel sharon , started to close itself off from the palestinians behind a gigantic wall . no compromise it was only after arafat 's death , in november 2004 , and with great effort , that negotiations resumed , but they failed to bring results .
at the same time , those opposed to any kind of settlement gained ever more influence .
in early 2006 , hamas won elections in the palestinian territories .
the islamist group refused to recognize israel or the oslo accords , and the palestinians again became isolated , particularly from the west .
israel was intransigent , deciding to make no more compromises .
the situation in the gaza strip , which israel had evacuated , began to resemble war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a legacy of violence that us president george w. bush wanted to finish his last year in office with peace in the middle east made no difference .
there was nothing to indicate he would succeed . instead , the atmosphere among palestinians and israelis continues to deteriorate .
the palestinians fight among themselves .
israel intends to spend millions on celebrating the 60th anniversary of statehood , but even that is controversial .
the anniversary year was declared the " year of youth . "
but critics point out that over one-third of young israelis live below the poverty level - which is certainly nothing to celebrate . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new study has found that by the year 2020 , the number of people belonging to germany 's middle class could fall below 50 percent of the population if economic growth rates do n't increase substantially . the study , by the consulting group mckinsey , found that in 12 years , 10 million fewer people could belong to the middle class than did at the beginning of the 1990s if economic growth levels do not surpass the forecast 1.7 percent , according to the german newspaper welt am sonntag , which had seen the report . " the economic growth that we have experienced over the past 15 years has not been enough to reach the citizens , " frank mattern , head of mckinsey 's germany operations , told the newspaper .
" for people in the middle-income range , small growth rates are equivalent to losses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endangered species ?
for the report , called " germany 2020 , " people are considered middle class if they earn between 70 and 150 percent of the average yearly wage in germany , which according to mckinsey in 2006 was around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,515 -rrb- . the researchers painted two scenarios for germany .
in the first , economic growth would proceed as predicted and almost 30 percent of germans would fall out of the middle class . a second , more positive scenario has the german economy growing at a more dynamic rate , around three percent annually .
according to that forecast , average per capita income could rise some 40 from 2006 to around 36,000 euros .
mckinsey based its calculations , according to the article , on research into eleven industrial sectors which make up more than 50 percent of the german economy . the last time germany experienced growth rates of three percent was in the middle of the 1980s , but mckinsey researchers have said reaching those levels again is not unrealistic . " we are proceeding on the assumption that we can reach a growth rate of three percent and well before 2020 , " mattern said .
" the world economy is growing at four percent .

that corresponds to a decrease from 49 to 44 million people in the middle-income range . in the period from 1996 to 2006 , the number of wealthy people earning more than 200 percent of the average income level went from 6.4 to 9.2 percent and the number of poor earning less than 50 percent of the average increased from 7.3 to 11.4 percent . old-age poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly is a big concern for women according to a survey by the emnid research institute published in the bild am sonntag newspaper , almost three-quarters of germans think that in a few years , poverty among the elderly will be the biggest problem the country faces . the poll found that 73 percent thought the days of expecting a comfortable retirement with a state-provided pension were soon to be a thing of the past .

while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .

while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .

a new study has found that by the year 2020 , the number of people belonging to germany 's middle class could fall below 50 percent of the population if economic growth rates do n't increase substantially . the study , by the consulting group mckinsey , found that in 12 years , 10 million fewer people could belong to the middle class than did at the beginning of the 1990s if economic growth levels do not surpass the forecast 1.7 percent , according to the german newspaper welt am sonntag , which had seen the report . " the economic growth that we have experienced over the past 15 years has not been enough to reach the citizens , " frank mattern , head of mckinsey 's germany operations , told the newspaper .
" for people in the middle-income range , small growth rates are equivalent to losses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endangered species ?
for the report , called " germany 2020 , " people are considered middle class if they earn between 70 and 150 percent of the average yearly wage in germany , which according to mckinsey in 2006 was around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,515 -rrb- . the researchers painted two scenarios for germany .
in the first , economic growth would proceed as predicted and almost 30 percent of germans would fall out of the middle class . a second , more positive scenario has the german economy growing at a more dynamic rate , around three percent annually .
according to that forecast , average per capita income could rise some 40 from 2006 to around 36,000 euros .
mckinsey based its calculations , according to the article , on research into eleven industrial sectors which make up more than 50 percent of the german economy . the last time germany experienced growth rates of three percent was in the middle of the 1980s , but mckinsey researchers have said reaching those levels again is not unrealistic . " we are proceeding on the assumption that we can reach a growth rate of three percent and well before 2020 , " mattern said .
" the world economy is growing at four percent . " the ends are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rich are getting richer the numbers correspond to a report put out the diw economics institute at the beginning of march that found the group of middle-income earners was shrinking while substantial growth was occurring at the two ends of the income spectrum : the rich and the poor . while the number of middle-income earners remained stable from 1992 to 2000 at 62 percent of the population , it had fallen to 54 percent by 2006 , researchers found .
that corresponds to a decrease from 49 to 44 million people in the middle-income range . in the period from 1996 to 2006 , the number of wealthy people earning more than 200 percent of the average income level went from 6.4 to 9.2 percent and the number of poor earning less than 50 percent of the average increased from 7.3 to 11.4 percent . old-age poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly is a big concern for women according to a survey by the emnid research institute published in the bild am sonntag newspaper , almost three-quarters of germans think that in a few years , poverty among the elderly will be the biggest problem the country faces . the poll found that 73 percent thought the days of expecting a comfortable retirement with a state-provided pension were soon to be a thing of the past .
the concern is especially acute among women and those between 50 and 64 years of age , the paper said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this can not be the model for us , " steinmeier , who under former chancellor gerhard schroeder strongly opposed the iraq war , said . evolving threats leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have proposed setting up a german version of the us nsc . in a joint draft strategy paper , they argue that the new council would serve as a " political analysis , coordination and decision-making center " in the face of evolving threats . the paper calls for a concentration of all forces to secure both internal and external security in a national security council under the chairmanship of the german chancellor .
the proposal includes deploying the bundeswehr or german army within german borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party says global terrorism poses unforeseen threats " the threat of global terrorism makes it important that we get past the traditional division of domestic and foreign security , " volker kauder , the conservatives ' parliamentary leader , told the welt am sonntag paper over the weekend .
" ensuring the supply of energy and raw materials is another important security policy point . " on monday , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a news conference that chancellor merkel supported the creation of the nsc . social democrats cry foul however , senior social democrats who share power in an uneasy grand coalition government with the cdu have criticized the plan , arguing it 's a thinly-veiled attempt at wresting policy away from the foreign ministry led by steinmeier . peter struck , head of the spd group in parliament , said the nsc was totally superfluous . " these plans have to be taken off the table , " spd foreign policy expert gert weisskirchen told the tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he added that there " absolutely no need " to relocate foreign policy decisions from the foreign ministry to the chancellery , as the plan reportedly calls for . opposition remains sceptical the proposal has also been slammed by opposition parties . the head of the free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , told the schleswig-holstein am sonntag newspaper he thought the cdu / csu plan could " massively shift - and damage - our foreign policy . "
he said he also feared the proposal could be used as an initial step in allowing the domestic deployment of the germany army , a plan which the fdp has long rejected . claudia roth , head of the greens said the nsc proposal redefined the duties of the german army in a " dramatic fashion . " " the conservatives want to send german soldiers to wars for oil and water .
that ca n't be the answer to global crises and global warming , " roth told german news agency dpa . german media has reported the conservatives planned to present their report to party members on tuesday and the entire bundestag on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new study has found that by the year 2020 , the number of people belonging to germany 's middle class could fall below 50 percent of the population if economic growth rates do n't increase substantially . the study , by the consulting group mckinsey , found that in 12 years , 10 million fewer people could belong to the middle class than did at the beginning of the 1990s if economic growth levels do not surpass the forecast 1.7 percent , according to the german newspaper welt am sonntag , which had seen the report . " the economic growth that we have experienced over the past 15 years has not been enough to reach the citizens , " frank mattern , head of mckinsey 's germany operations , told the newspaper .
" for people in the middle-income range , small growth rates are equivalent to losses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endangered species ?
for the report , called " germany 2020 , " people are considered middle class if they earn between 70 and 150 percent of the average yearly wage in germany , which according to mckinsey in 2006 was around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,515 -rrb- . the researchers painted two scenarios for germany .
in the first , economic growth would proceed as predicted and almost 30 percent of germans would fall out of the middle class . a second , more positive scenario has the german economy growing at a more dynamic rate , around three percent annually .
according to that forecast , average per capita income could rise some 40 from 2006 to around 36,000 euros .
mckinsey based its calculations , according to the article , on research into eleven industrial sectors which make up more than 50 percent of the german economy . the last time germany experienced growth rates of three percent was in the middle of the 1980s , but mckinsey researchers have said reaching those levels again is not unrealistic .

that corresponds to a decrease from 49 to 44 million people in the middle-income range . in the period from 1996 to 2006 , the number of wealthy people earning more than 200 percent of the average income level went from 6.4 to 9.2 percent and the number of poor earning less than 50 percent of the average increased from 7.3 to 11.4 percent . old-age poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly is a big concern for women according to a survey by the emnid research institute published in the bild am sonntag newspaper , almost three-quarters of germans think that in a few years , poverty among the elderly will be the biggest problem the country faces . the poll found that 73 percent thought the days of expecting a comfortable retirement with a state-provided pension were soon to be a thing of the past .

yet everything is not as rosy as it might appear , says deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel . russian rulers have a soft spot for political symbolism , and there will be plenty of it on display this week .
the eight-year presidency of vladimir putin will come to an end on wednesday , may 7 , with dmitry medvedev taking over russia 's highest public office .
the day after the president 's inauguration , putin will be confirmed as prime minister by the duma . if the inauguration and the successful handover in the kremlin were n't enough , on friday , celebrations will get underway for the most important national holiday in modern russian history .
victory over nazi germany in world war ii will be observed with parades and pathos . it 's difficult to imagine a more grandiose finale to " operation successor . " putin 's sweeping success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel you have to hand it to vladimir putin .
he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "
the " tandem democracy " of medvedev as president and putin as head of government is supposed to protect political and economic stability .
both ceaselessly repeated that they are doing it to help further modernize the country . but it 's questionable whether the new double rule of putin and medvedev can ensure political stability . in russian history , " dual power " brings instability .
the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .
at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .
and even more important is to know whether they will both adhere to this arrangement over the long term .
if not , stability and continuity will give way to friction and instability . ingo mannteufel is head of the russian section of dw-radio and dw-world.de. -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .
the states of the arab league , which had been founded not long before , hoped to exterminate the new entity they believed the west had brought upon them - the british with the balfour declaration , in which they promised the jews support in the establishment of a national homeland in 1917 ; the un with its 1947 partition plan for palestine ; and the united states with its active support for the foundation of the state of israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1973 : general moshe dayan -lrb- l . -rrb- with ariel sharon on the egyptian side of the suez canal against all expectations , the arab plan failed .

" this can not be the model for us , " steinmeier , who under former chancellor gerhard schroeder strongly opposed the iraq war , said . evolving threats leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have proposed setting up a german version of the us nsc . in a joint draft strategy paper , they argue that the new council would serve as a " political analysis , coordination and decision-making center " in the face of evolving threats . the paper calls for a concentration of all forces to secure both internal and external security in a national security council under the chairmanship of the german chancellor .
the proposal includes deploying the bundeswehr or german army within german borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party says global terrorism poses unforeseen threats " the threat of global terrorism makes it important that we get past the traditional division of domestic and foreign security , " volker kauder , the conservatives ' parliamentary leader , told the welt am sonntag paper over the weekend .
" ensuring the supply of energy and raw materials is another important security policy point . " on monday , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a news conference that chancellor merkel supported the creation of the nsc . social democrats cry foul however , senior social democrats who share power in an uneasy grand coalition government with the cdu have criticized the plan , arguing it 's a thinly-veiled attempt at wresting policy away from the foreign ministry led by steinmeier . peter struck , head of the spd group in parliament , said the nsc was totally superfluous . " these plans have to be taken off the table , " spd foreign policy expert gert weisskirchen told the tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he added that there " absolutely no need " to relocate foreign policy decisions from the foreign ministry to the chancellery , as the plan reportedly calls for . opposition remains sceptical the proposal has also been slammed by opposition parties . the head of the free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , told the schleswig-holstein am sonntag newspaper he thought the cdu / csu plan could " massively shift - and damage - our foreign policy . "
he said he also feared the proposal could be used as an initial step in allowing the domestic deployment of the germany army , a plan which the fdp has long rejected . claudia roth , head of the greens said the nsc proposal redefined the duties of the german army in a " dramatic fashion . " " the conservatives want to send german soldiers to wars for oil and water .
that ca n't be the answer to global crises and global warming , " roth told german news agency dpa . german media has reported the conservatives planned to present their report to party members on tuesday and the entire bundestag on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet everything is not as rosy as it might appear , says deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel . russian rulers have a soft spot for political symbolism , and there will be plenty of it on display this week .
the eight-year presidency of vladimir putin will come to an end on wednesday , may 7 , with dmitry medvedev taking over russia 's highest public office .
the day after the president 's inauguration , putin will be confirmed as prime minister by the duma . if the inauguration and the successful handover in the kremlin were n't enough , on friday , celebrations will get underway for the most important national holiday in modern russian history .
victory over nazi germany in world war ii will be observed with parades and pathos . it 's difficult to imagine a more grandiose finale to " operation successor . " putin 's sweeping success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel you have to hand it to vladimir putin .
he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "
the " tandem democracy " of medvedev as president and putin as head of government is supposed to protect political and economic stability .
both ceaselessly repeated that they are doing it to help further modernize the country . but it 's questionable whether the new double rule of putin and medvedev can ensure political stability . in russian history , " dual power " brings instability .
the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .
at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .
and even more important is to know whether they will both adhere to this arrangement over the long term .
if not , stability and continuity will give way to friction and instability . ingo mannteufel is head of the russian section of dw-radio and dw-world.de. -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this can not be the model for us , " steinmeier , who under former chancellor gerhard schroeder strongly opposed the iraq war , said . evolving threats leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have proposed setting up a german version of the us nsc . in a joint draft strategy paper , they argue that the new council would serve as a " political analysis , coordination and decision-making center " in the face of evolving threats . the paper calls for a concentration of all forces to secure both internal and external security in a national security council under the chairmanship of the german chancellor .
the proposal includes deploying the bundeswehr or german army within german borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party says global terrorism poses unforeseen threats " the threat of global terrorism makes it important that we get past the traditional division of domestic and foreign security , " volker kauder , the conservatives ' parliamentary leader , told the welt am sonntag paper over the weekend .
" ensuring the supply of energy and raw materials is another important security policy point . " on monday , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a news conference that chancellor merkel supported the creation of the nsc . social democrats cry foul however , senior social democrats who share power in an uneasy grand coalition government with the cdu have criticized the plan , arguing it 's a thinly-veiled attempt at wresting policy away from the foreign ministry led by steinmeier . peter struck , head of the spd group in parliament , said the nsc was totally superfluous . " these plans have to be taken off the table , " spd foreign policy expert gert weisskirchen told the tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he added that there " absolutely no need " to relocate foreign policy decisions from the foreign ministry to the chancellery , as the plan reportedly calls for . opposition remains sceptical the proposal has also been slammed by opposition parties . the head of the free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , told the schleswig-holstein am sonntag newspaper he thought the cdu / csu plan could " massively shift - and damage - our foreign policy . "
he said he also feared the proposal could be used as an initial step in allowing the domestic deployment of the germany army , a plan which the fdp has long rejected . claudia roth , head of the greens said the nsc proposal redefined the duties of the german army in a " dramatic fashion . " " the conservatives want to send german soldiers to wars for oil and water .
that ca n't be the answer to global crises and global warming , " roth told german news agency dpa . german media has reported the conservatives planned to present their report to party members on tuesday and the entire bundestag on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this can not be the model for us , " steinmeier , who under former chancellor gerhard schroeder strongly opposed the iraq war , said . evolving threats leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have proposed setting up a german version of the us nsc . in a joint draft strategy paper , they argue that the new council would serve as a " political analysis , coordination and decision-making center " in the face of evolving threats . the paper calls for a concentration of all forces to secure both internal and external security in a national security council under the chairmanship of the german chancellor .
the proposal includes deploying the bundeswehr or german army within german borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party says global terrorism poses unforeseen threats " the threat of global terrorism makes it important that we get past the traditional division of domestic and foreign security , " volker kauder , the conservatives ' parliamentary leader , told the welt am sonntag paper over the weekend .
" ensuring the supply of energy and raw materials is another important security policy point . " on monday , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a news conference that chancellor merkel supported the creation of the nsc . social democrats cry foul however , senior social democrats who share power in an uneasy grand coalition government with the cdu have criticized the plan , arguing it 's a thinly-veiled attempt at wresting policy away from the foreign ministry led by steinmeier . peter struck , head of the spd group in parliament , said the nsc was totally superfluous . " these plans have to be taken off the table , " spd foreign policy expert gert weisskirchen told the tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he added that there " absolutely no need " to relocate foreign policy decisions from the foreign ministry to the chancellery , as the plan reportedly calls for . opposition remains sceptical the proposal has also been slammed by opposition parties . the head of the free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , told the schleswig-holstein am sonntag newspaper he thought the cdu / csu plan could " massively shift - and damage - our foreign policy . "
he said he also feared the proposal could be used as an initial step in allowing the domestic deployment of the germany army , a plan which the fdp has long rejected . claudia roth , head of the greens said the nsc proposal redefined the duties of the german army in a " dramatic fashion . " " the conservatives want to send german soldiers to wars for oil and water .
that ca n't be the answer to global crises and global warming , " roth told german news agency dpa . german media has reported the conservatives planned to present their report to party members on tuesday and the entire bundestag on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet everything is not as rosy as it might appear , says deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel . russian rulers have a soft spot for political symbolism , and there will be plenty of it on display this week .
the eight-year presidency of vladimir putin will come to an end on wednesday , may 7 , with dmitry medvedev taking over russia 's highest public office .
the day after the president 's inauguration , putin will be confirmed as prime minister by the duma . if the inauguration and the successful handover in the kremlin were n't enough , on friday , celebrations will get underway for the most important national holiday in modern russian history .
victory over nazi germany in world war ii will be observed with parades and pathos . it 's difficult to imagine a more grandiose finale to " operation successor . " putin 's sweeping success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel you have to hand it to vladimir putin .
he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "
the " tandem democracy " of medvedev as president and putin as head of government is supposed to protect political and economic stability .
both ceaselessly repeated that they are doing it to help further modernize the country . but it 's questionable whether the new double rule of putin and medvedev can ensure political stability . in russian history , " dual power " brings instability .
the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .
at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .
and even more important is to know whether they will both adhere to this arrangement over the long term .
if not , stability and continuity will give way to friction and instability . ingo mannteufel is head of the russian section of dw-radio and dw-world.de. -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nowadays , they 're acknowledged for the contribution to the construction of contemporary israel , and " yeck " has become a compliment . " lul " is a classic sketch of israeli humor .
it describes the waves of immigrants that came from europe to the middle east .
first there were the russians , then the poles , then the yeckes - the german jews . wearing felt hats and lederhosen , fritzi and his father arrive from europe .
fritzi is visibly shocked as he looks around .
" but father , " he cries , " is this palestine ?
it 's all just sand ? "
in a heavy german accent , his father replies , " you bonehead , we 'll bring this desert to life . " the sketch runs on a loop in the yeckes museum in tefen in western galilee as a point of entry to the exhibition about german jews .
it may be something of an overstatement , but it still contains a kernel of truth , said ruth ofek , the museum 's head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is in an industrial park in tefen " the yeckes had an important part in israel 's development , " she said .
" they made a mark everywhere , in medicine , science , philosophy and in the legal system . "
from jackets to yeckes ? it 's not clear where the word " yeck " comes from .
it may have to do with german jews having worn short jackets , jacken in german , in contrast to the long caftans worn by eastern european jews .
in any case , the stereotypical israeli view says that yeckes are upstanding , honest and educated as well as a bit difficult and stubborn . they are qualities israelis have come to appreciate , according to ofek , and the term " yeck " has become a compliment .
the yeck museum documents the history of the german jews in israel .
photos , posters , everyday objects and furniture spread around the two-story exhibition tell stories about the yeckes . the museum 's fortunate in that young people frequently donate their grandparents ' german books and letters , because they ca n't read them .
thus , stories of the yeckes , sometimes also spelled yekkes , are unlikely to go missing and the documents can be presented to a wider public .
new land , new start the yeckes started coming to palestine in greater numbers in the 1930s , mainly fleeing from the nazis .
it was tough - for everyone - in the inhospitable land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenthal fled to palestine at 17 born in 1915 in then-german breslau , now wroclaw , poland , hans gruenthal was an enthusiastic and active zionist as a young man .
when the nazis took power of germany in 1933 , he fled .
even before his 18th birthday , gruenthal arrived - alone , without papers and illegally - in palestine .
he trained to be an electrician and quickly set about learning hebrew . " no one spoke german , " recalled hans gruenthal .
" it was frowned upon . " those who could speak a smattering of yiddish were in a better position .
on may 14 , 1948 , when israel was founded , gruenthal was 33 years old , and he remembers it well .
" we all celebrated then , " he said .

while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .
the states of the arab league , which had been founded not long before , hoped to exterminate the new entity they believed the west had brought upon them - the british with the balfour declaration , in which they promised the jews support in the establishment of a national homeland in 1917 ; the un with its 1947 partition plan for palestine ; and the united states with its active support for the foundation of the state of israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1973 : general moshe dayan -lrb- l . -rrb- with ariel sharon on the egyptian side of the suez canal against all expectations , the arab plan failed .
israel expanded its territory even beyond the lines of the partition .
more than 750,000 palestinians were forced to leave their homes - out of fear for their lives or because they were expelled .
they remain the central problem in the conflict 60 years later - and their numbers have grown to around 4 million . the 1948 defeat affected the arabs - indeed the whole muslim world - deeply .
they were unwilling to accept the result and vowed vengeance .
and because the arabs were loath to admit their defeat at the hands of the tiny jewish state , they held the west responsible for it .
thus , the legend arose that nurtures radical groups and demagogues to this day : israel as the outpost of an anti-arabic and anti-islamic west in the middle east , just as the crusaders were hundreds of years ago . common cause israel 's enemies believe they have repeatedly seen their thesis confirmed .
in 1956 , they saw as confirmation that israel , france and britain joined forces in the suez crisis .
the europeans were concerned about the suez canal , while the israelis wanted to ensure the security of their border to egypt .
during the cold war , egypt , syria and iraq became allies with moscow , which strengthened all the more the connection between the us and israel and conservative arab states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1977 : israel 's menachem begin whispers to egypt 's anwar sadat the most important change came after the six-day war in june 1967 .
despite israeli warnings , egyptian president gamal abdel nasser closed the straits of tiran , giving israel an excuse for a preventive strike .
jordan and syria 's intervention was no help to cairo .
within six days , israel had seized the entire sinai peninsula , the gaza strip , the west bank and the golan heights . suddenly israel controlled all of historic palestine .
some israelis were hopeful that a call would come from amman or cairo offering peace in exchange for occupied territory .
but the telephone did n't ring .
instead , in khartoum , the arab league declared its " three no 's " : no peace with israel , no recognition of israel , no negotiations with israel . peace with the arch-enemy in the 1973 yom kippur war , the arabs succeeded in improving their damaged self-confidence , with syria and egypt causing heavy damage to israel .
but the war ended without victors .
the new constellation , however , allowed egyptian president anwar sadat to start a peace initiative which culminated in the camp david accords between egypt and israel in 1978 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1993 : rabin and arafat sealed the peace deal at the white house the palestinians could have been part of the peace agreement , but with encouragement from the arab world , they rejected it .
it was n't until 15 years later , in 1993 , that israel and the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- under yasser arafat agreed on the oslo peace plan , which was meant to lead to israel pulling out of the occupied territories and the foundation of a palestinian state .
finally the most important palestinian groups were willing to accept the two-state solution recommended by the un partition plan 46 years previously . rabin 's assassination but resistance came from the israeli side too .
likud party nationalists under benjamin netanyahu denounced what they said was a betrayal of the historic homeland , as they viewed all of palestine as eretz yisrael , belonging to the land of israel .
they warned against the dangers for israel of giving up the occupied territories . in november 1995 prime minister yitzhak rabin , who had signed the oslo accords , was assassinated .
the following year , netanyahu was elected prime minister , and israel began to sabotage the implementation of the oslo plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1995 : rabin 's assassination by an israeli came as a shock growing dissatisfaction among palestinians added to the political crisis in israel .
in autumn 2000 the second intifada started .
in the course of the " al-aqsa intifada " nearly every positive development in the palestinian territories was destroyed : autonomous self-administration once again became occupied territories , and israel , under ariel sharon , started to close itself off from the palestinians behind a gigantic wall . no compromise it was only after arafat 's death , in november 2004 , and with great effort , that negotiations resumed , but they failed to bring results .
at the same time , those opposed to any kind of settlement gained ever more influence .
in early 2006 , hamas won elections in the palestinian territories .
the islamist group refused to recognize israel or the oslo accords , and the palestinians again became isolated , particularly from the west .
israel was intransigent , deciding to make no more compromises .
the situation in the gaza strip , which israel had evacuated , began to resemble war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a legacy of violence that us president george w. bush wanted to finish his last year in office with peace in the middle east made no difference .
there was nothing to indicate he would succeed . instead , the atmosphere among palestinians and israelis continues to deteriorate .
the palestinians fight among themselves .
israel intends to spend millions on celebrating the 60th anniversary of statehood , but even that is controversial .
the anniversary year was declared the " year of youth . "
but critics point out that over one-third of young israelis live below the poverty level - which is certainly nothing to celebrate . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .
the states of the arab league , which had been founded not long before , hoped to exterminate the new entity they believed the west had brought upon them - the british with the balfour declaration , in which they promised the jews support in the establishment of a national homeland in 1917 ; the un with its 1947 partition plan for palestine ; and the united states with its active support for the foundation of the state of israel .

more than 750,000 palestinians were forced to leave their homes - out of fear for their lives or because they were expelled .
they remain the central problem in the conflict 60 years later - and their numbers have grown to around 4 million . the 1948 defeat affected the arabs - indeed the whole muslim world - deeply .
they were unwilling to accept the result and vowed vengeance .
and because the arabs were loath to admit their defeat at the hands of the tiny jewish state , they held the west responsible for it .
thus , the legend arose that nurtures radical groups and demagogues to this day : israel as the outpost of an anti-arabic and anti-islamic west in the middle east , just as the crusaders were hundreds of years ago . common cause israel 's enemies believe they have repeatedly seen their thesis confirmed .
in 1956 , they saw as confirmation that israel , france and britain joined forces in the suez crisis .

" this can not be the model for us , " steinmeier , who under former chancellor gerhard schroeder strongly opposed the iraq war , said . evolving threats leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have proposed setting up a german version of the us nsc . in a joint draft strategy paper , they argue that the new council would serve as a " political analysis , coordination and decision-making center " in the face of evolving threats . the paper calls for a concentration of all forces to secure both internal and external security in a national security council under the chairmanship of the german chancellor .
the proposal includes deploying the bundeswehr or german army within german borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party says global terrorism poses unforeseen threats " the threat of global terrorism makes it important that we get past the traditional division of domestic and foreign security , " volker kauder , the conservatives ' parliamentary leader , told the welt am sonntag paper over the weekend .

" these plans have to be taken off the table , " spd foreign policy expert gert weisskirchen told the tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he added that there " absolutely no need " to relocate foreign policy decisions from the foreign ministry to the chancellery , as the plan reportedly calls for . opposition remains sceptical the proposal has also been slammed by opposition parties . the head of the free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , told the schleswig-holstein am sonntag newspaper he thought the cdu / csu plan could " massively shift - and damage - our foreign policy . "
he said he also feared the proposal could be used as an initial step in allowing the domestic deployment of the germany army , a plan which the fdp has long rejected . claudia roth , head of the greens said the nsc proposal redefined the duties of the german army in a " dramatic fashion .

its naissance in 1948 was marked by the holocaust : some 6 million jews had been murdered by the nazis in germany just a few years earlier .
as a result , the united nations supported the founding of a new jewish state . on may 14 , 1948 , israel 's first prime minister david ben gurion proclaimed the birth of israel in tel aviv .
not long after , nearby arab countries attacked the young nation and , even today , ties remain strained between israel and its neighbors .
it maintains peace treaties with egypt and jordan .
since the six day war in 1967 , israel has occupied the west bank region . despite the holocaust - which has left scars on the country - several wars , domestic crises and threats by its arab neighbors , israel is seen as a model of success .

while arabs call the day " the catastrophe , " many israelis are n't in the mood to celebrate .
a look back on six decades of dreams and nightmares . on may 14 , 1948 , the leaders of palestine 's jewish population , the yishuv , gathered in tel aviv 's museum to realize the dream that had begun taking shape over decades of growing jewish immigration : to establish the jewish state propagated by the father of political zionism , theodor herzl .
the opportunity had finally arrived .
just hours before the british mandate over palestine came to an end and the british high commissioner left the country , david ben-gurion declared the founding of the state of israel . the israelis quickly recognized that the realization of their dream actually meant a shift from one nightmare to the next : from persecution and annihilation in europe to latent war and open threats to their existence .
for decades most people in the middle east refused to accept israel 's existence , or even its right to exist .
israel 's independence day became known as the nakba , the catastrophe , in arabic and continues to be called that . celebrations followed by grenades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1967 : the six-day war has been described as a david and goliath struggle within hours the statehood celebrations were interrupted by the droning of bombs and grenades , and israel was forced to fight its first war .
the states of the arab league , which had been founded not long before , hoped to exterminate the new entity they believed the west had brought upon them - the british with the balfour declaration , in which they promised the jews support in the establishment of a national homeland in 1917 ; the un with its 1947 partition plan for palestine ; and the united states with its active support for the foundation of the state of israel .

israel expanded its territory even beyond the lines of the partition .
more than 750,000 palestinians were forced to leave their homes - out of fear for their lives or because they were expelled .
they remain the central problem in the conflict 60 years later - and their numbers have grown to around 4 million . the 1948 defeat affected the arabs - indeed the whole muslim world - deeply .
they were unwilling to accept the result and vowed vengeance .
and because the arabs were loath to admit their defeat at the hands of the tiny jewish state , they held the west responsible for it .
thus , the legend arose that nurtures radical groups and demagogues to this day : israel as the outpost of an anti-arabic and anti-islamic west in the middle east , just as the crusaders were hundreds of years ago . common cause israel 's enemies believe they have repeatedly seen their thesis confirmed .
in 1956 , they saw as confirmation that israel , france and britain joined forces in the suez crisis .
the europeans were concerned about the suez canal , while the israelis wanted to ensure the security of their border to egypt .
during the cold war , egypt , syria and iraq became allies with moscow , which strengthened all the more the connection between the us and israel and conservative arab states .

within six days , israel had seized the entire sinai peninsula , the gaza strip , the west bank and the golan heights . suddenly israel controlled all of historic palestine .
some israelis were hopeful that a call would come from amman or cairo offering peace in exchange for occupied territory .
but the telephone did n't ring .
instead , in khartoum , the arab league declared its " three no 's " : no peace with israel , no recognition of israel , no negotiations with israel . peace with the arch-enemy in the 1973 yom kippur war , the arabs succeeded in improving their damaged self-confidence , with syria and egypt causing heavy damage to israel .
but the war ended without victors .

finally the most important palestinian groups were willing to accept the two-state solution recommended by the un partition plan 46 years previously . rabin 's assassination but resistance came from the israeli side too .
likud party nationalists under benjamin netanyahu denounced what they said was a betrayal of the historic homeland , as they viewed all of palestine as eretz yisrael , belonging to the land of israel .
they warned against the dangers for israel of giving up the occupied territories . in november 1995 prime minister yitzhak rabin , who had signed the oslo accords , was assassinated .

at the same time , those opposed to any kind of settlement gained ever more influence .

but the two countries have managed to develop a friendly parthership based on solidarity , even if its start was difficult . german president horst koehler said during a speech to israel 's parliament , the knesset , that normality could not exist between germany and israel .
that was in 2005 , when the two countries had already been fostering diplomatic relations for 40 years .
the feeling that nothing could be normal between the two countries was even stronger in the first decade after the holocaust . from its outset , the young west german democracy was to bear the moral responsibility of the murder of millions of jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1960 : adenauer and ben- gurion in new york the first opportunity for chancellor konrad adenauer to establish relations with israel was in the form of financial compensation , or wiedergutmachung .
in 1952 , it was decided that some 3.45 billion deutsche marks -lrb- 1.76 billion euros , or $ 2.8 billion -rrb- would be paid to the israeli state to help " cleanse souls of infinite suffering , " as adenauer said . is shaking hands acceptable ? the reparations were controversial in israel because many believed that money was no compensation .
many israelis could not even imagine shaking hands with a german . that was not the case with david ben-gurion , israel 's first prime minister , who held a friendly meeting with adenauer in new york in 1960 .
ben-gurion was convinced that germany had changed and was no longer nazi-deutschland . " we should not forget what happened , but we should also not base our actions on what happened , " he said . on the domestic front , ben-gurion reaped a great deal of criticism for his attitude , while adenauer was put under pressure by arab states for seeking relations with israel . " relatively early " bildunterschrift : 1965 : rolf pauls -lrb- l -rrb- with israeli president zalman shazar in 1965 , two decades after the war , the federal republic of germany and israel established diplomatic relations .
rolf pauls , the first ambassador to israel , found - as he was greeted with protests in the country - that it was " relatively early . " israel and west germany then took baby steps toward one another .
a network of contacts on the civilian level was also established and helped relations during times of crises .
for israel , it was important that germany demonstrated its solidarity during difficult times , such as the wars with neighboring arab nations . germany continues to try to fulfill this wish for solidarity - even 60 years after the founding of israel .
" germany bears a particular responsibility for israel - for protecting and defending its right to exist , " said foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , in describing one of the foundations of germany 's foreign policy toward the jewish state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2008 : israel 's president shimon peres -lrb- l -rrb- welcomes german chancellor merkel this stance , however , also explains why the federal republic is inhibited in taking a stand on the conflict between israel and the palestinians . speechlessness is normal a certain speechlessness is also manifest in the calm that has meanwhile developed in the relationship between israel and germany .
president koehler was expressing it in his comment about normality not being possible between the two countries . likewise , not everyone in the knesset wanted to hear a speech given in german - not even in 2008 - when chancellor angela merkel spoke before israeli members of parliament .
most parliamentarians , however , responded to her words with long and friendly applause as she congratulated them on the 60th anniversary of the founding of their state and assured them that germany would never leave israel out in the cold . nina werkhäuser -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet everything is not as rosy as it might appear , says deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel . russian rulers have a soft spot for political symbolism , and there will be plenty of it on display this week .
the eight-year presidency of vladimir putin will come to an end on wednesday , may 7 , with dmitry medvedev taking over russia 's highest public office .
the day after the president 's inauguration , putin will be confirmed as prime minister by the duma . if the inauguration and the successful handover in the kremlin were n't enough , on friday , celebrations will get underway for the most important national holiday in modern russian history .
victory over nazi germany in world war ii will be observed with parades and pathos . it 's difficult to imagine a more grandiose finale to " operation successor . " putin 's sweeping success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel you have to hand it to vladimir putin .
he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "
the " tandem democracy " of medvedev as president and putin as head of government is supposed to protect political and economic stability .
both ceaselessly repeated that they are doing it to help further modernize the country . but it 's questionable whether the new double rule of putin and medvedev can ensure political stability . in russian history , " dual power " brings instability .
the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .
at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .
and even more important is to know whether they will both adhere to this arrangement over the long term .
if not , stability and continuity will give way to friction and instability . ingo mannteufel is head of the russian section of dw-radio and dw-world.de. -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new study has found that by the year 2020 , the number of people belonging to germany 's middle class could fall below 50 percent of the population if economic growth rates do n't increase substantially . the study , by the consulting group mckinsey , found that in 12 years , 10 million fewer people could belong to the middle class than did at the beginning of the 1990s if economic growth levels do not surpass the forecast 1.7 percent , according to the german newspaper welt am sonntag , which had seen the report . " the economic growth that we have experienced over the past 15 years has not been enough to reach the citizens , " frank mattern , head of mckinsey 's germany operations , told the newspaper .
" for people in the middle-income range , small growth rates are equivalent to losses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endangered species ?
for the report , called " germany 2020 , " people are considered middle class if they earn between 70 and 150 percent of the average yearly wage in germany , which according to mckinsey in 2006 was around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,515 -rrb- . the researchers painted two scenarios for germany .
in the first , economic growth would proceed as predicted and almost 30 percent of germans would fall out of the middle class . a second , more positive scenario has the german economy growing at a more dynamic rate , around three percent annually .
according to that forecast , average per capita income could rise some 40 from 2006 to around 36,000 euros .
mckinsey based its calculations , according to the article , on research into eleven industrial sectors which make up more than 50 percent of the german economy . the last time germany experienced growth rates of three percent was in the middle of the 1980s , but mckinsey researchers have said reaching those levels again is not unrealistic . " we are proceeding on the assumption that we can reach a growth rate of three percent and well before 2020 , " mattern said .
" the world economy is growing at four percent . " the ends are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rich are getting richer the numbers correspond to a report put out the diw economics institute at the beginning of march that found the group of middle-income earners was shrinking while substantial growth was occurring at the two ends of the income spectrum : the rich and the poor . while the number of middle-income earners remained stable from 1992 to 2000 at 62 percent of the population , it had fallen to 54 percent by 2006 , researchers found .
that corresponds to a decrease from 49 to 44 million people in the middle-income range . in the period from 1996 to 2006 , the number of wealthy people earning more than 200 percent of the average income level went from 6.4 to 9.2 percent and the number of poor earning less than 50 percent of the average increased from 7.3 to 11.4 percent . old-age poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly is a big concern for women according to a survey by the emnid research institute published in the bild am sonntag newspaper , almost three-quarters of germans think that in a few years , poverty among the elderly will be the biggest problem the country faces . the poll found that 73 percent thought the days of expecting a comfortable retirement with a state-provided pension were soon to be a thing of the past .
the concern is especially acute among women and those between 50 and 64 years of age , the paper said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this can not be the model for us , " steinmeier , who under former chancellor gerhard schroeder strongly opposed the iraq war , said . evolving threats leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have proposed setting up a german version of the us nsc . in a joint draft strategy paper , they argue that the new council would serve as a " political analysis , coordination and decision-making center " in the face of evolving threats . the paper calls for a concentration of all forces to secure both internal and external security in a national security council under the chairmanship of the german chancellor .
the proposal includes deploying the bundeswehr or german army within german borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party says global terrorism poses unforeseen threats " the threat of global terrorism makes it important that we get past the traditional division of domestic and foreign security , " volker kauder , the conservatives ' parliamentary leader , told the welt am sonntag paper over the weekend .
" ensuring the supply of energy and raw materials is another important security policy point . " on monday , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a news conference that chancellor merkel supported the creation of the nsc . social democrats cry foul however , senior social democrats who share power in an uneasy grand coalition government with the cdu have criticized the plan , arguing it 's a thinly-veiled attempt at wresting policy away from the foreign ministry led by steinmeier . peter struck , head of the spd group in parliament , said the nsc was totally superfluous . " these plans have to be taken off the table , " spd foreign policy expert gert weisskirchen told the tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he added that there " absolutely no need " to relocate foreign policy decisions from the foreign ministry to the chancellery , as the plan reportedly calls for . opposition remains sceptical the proposal has also been slammed by opposition parties . the head of the free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , told the schleswig-holstein am sonntag newspaper he thought the cdu / csu plan could " massively shift - and damage - our foreign policy . "
he said he also feared the proposal could be used as an initial step in allowing the domestic deployment of the germany army , a plan which the fdp has long rejected . claudia roth , head of the greens said the nsc proposal redefined the duties of the german army in a " dramatic fashion . " " the conservatives want to send german soldiers to wars for oil and water .
that ca n't be the answer to global crises and global warming , " roth told german news agency dpa . german media has reported the conservatives planned to present their report to party members on tuesday and the entire bundestag on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "
the " tandem democracy " of medvedev as president and putin as head of government is supposed to protect political and economic stability .
both ceaselessly repeated that they are doing it to help further modernize the country . but it 's questionable whether the new double rule of putin and medvedev can ensure political stability . in russian history , " dual power " brings instability .
the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .
at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .
and even more important is to know whether they will both adhere to this arrangement over the long term .

he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "

the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .

yet everything is not as rosy as it might appear , says deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel . russian rulers have a soft spot for political symbolism , and there will be plenty of it on display this week .
the eight-year presidency of vladimir putin will come to an end on wednesday , may 7 , with dmitry medvedev taking over russia 's highest public office .
the day after the president 's inauguration , putin will be confirmed as prime minister by the duma . if the inauguration and the successful handover in the kremlin were n't enough , on friday , celebrations will get underway for the most important national holiday in modern russian history .

" putin 's sweeping success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel you have to hand it to vladimir putin .
he managed an extraordinary feat which many political observers considered impossible only a few months ago .
putin gave up his post as russia 's president .
but without even changing the constitution , he will remain the central figure in the president 's office as prime minister under his political protege , medvedev .
in short : putin left in order to stay . putin made his claim on power clear by allowing himself to be selected as chairman of united russia , the party which has a two-thirds majority in the duma .
he also made sure to strengthen his position as head of government at the expense of presidential power . these are clear signals that putin does not expect to follow in the footsteps of former prime ministers mikhail fradkov or viktor zubkov , who served as bureaucratic government heads .
putin has already stressed that he sees his role as a " political prime minister " who will actively take part in policy decisions .
this will inevitably threaten the president 's power . risky footing in recent months , the central message from putin and medvedev has been that russia is entering a new era of " dual power . "
the " tandem democracy " of medvedev as president and putin as head of government is supposed to protect political and economic stability .
both ceaselessly repeated that they are doing it to help further modernize the country . but it 's questionable whether the new double rule of putin and medvedev can ensure political stability . in russian history , " dual power " brings instability .
the " dual power " of the provisional government and the petrograd soviet of workers ' and soldiers ' deputies led to civil war in the revolutionary year of 1917 . the " dual power " of president yeltsin and the supreme soviet under the chairmanship of ruslan khasbulatov ended in october 1993 with the bombing of the russian white house , the supreme soviet 's former headquarters .
coincidentally , the white house on the moskva river is the current headquarters of the russian prime minister , which makes it putin 's future office . secondly , " dual power , " or the existence of two " czars " does not fit russian political culture .
friction between the two power centers seems inevitable , think khrushchev and malenkov after stalin 's death or take gorbachev and his adversary yegor ligachev . russians will search for political clarity by trying to determine who is the " right " czar . there is also the question of whether medvedev is ready to subordinate himself to prime minister putin .
at present , medvedev is still very diplomatic and reserved on this question . yet it 's important to remember that medvedev will have complete authority as president .
as the president he is commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces and controls the " power ministries " of the army , police and security agencies .
medvedev also has a strong position in relation to the prime minister , who he can dismiss , and to the duma , which he can dissolve . on the other side , prime minister putin , with united russia 's two-thirds majority in the duma can block presidential decrees and through constitutional amendments completely gut the power of the president . unclear division of power at first sight the new " dual power " of medvedev and putin can be seen as a specifically russian form of " checks and balances . "
but a basic error of this new political construction lies in the fact that the division of power is not implemented between the executive , legislative and judicial branches , but rather as a somewhat unclear division of power within the executive branch . crucial for this new power setup would be for medvedev and putin to clarify who exactly is russia 's leader .
and even more important is to know whether they will both adhere to this arrangement over the long term .

" the presidency of the eu is deeply concerned by the news of the imminent execution of behnoud shojaee , " according to the statement released sunday , may 4 .
shojaee 's execution is planned for wednesday , according to amnesty international .

a new study has found that by the year 2020 , the number of people belonging to germany 's middle class could fall below 50 percent of the population if economic growth rates do n't increase substantially . the study , by the consulting group mckinsey , found that in 12 years , 10 million fewer people could belong to the middle class than did at the beginning of the 1990s if economic growth levels do not surpass the forecast 1.7 percent , according to the german newspaper welt am sonntag , which had seen the report . " the economic growth that we have experienced over the past 15 years has not been enough to reach the citizens , " frank mattern , head of mckinsey 's germany operations , told the newspaper .
" for people in the middle-income range , small growth rates are equivalent to losses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endangered species ?
for the report , called " germany 2020 , " people are considered middle class if they earn between 70 and 150 percent of the average yearly wage in germany , which according to mckinsey in 2006 was around 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,515 -rrb- . the researchers painted two scenarios for germany .
in the first , economic growth would proceed as predicted and almost 30 percent of germans would fall out of the middle class . a second , more positive scenario has the german economy growing at a more dynamic rate , around three percent annually .
according to that forecast , average per capita income could rise some 40 from 2006 to around 36,000 euros .
mckinsey based its calculations , according to the article , on research into eleven industrial sectors which make up more than 50 percent of the german economy . the last time germany experienced growth rates of three percent was in the middle of the 1980s , but mckinsey researchers have said reaching those levels again is not unrealistic . " we are proceeding on the assumption that we can reach a growth rate of three percent and well before 2020 , " mattern said .
" the world economy is growing at four percent . " the ends are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rich are getting richer the numbers correspond to a report put out the diw economics institute at the beginning of march that found the group of middle-income earners was shrinking while substantial growth was occurring at the two ends of the income spectrum : the rich and the poor . while the number of middle-income earners remained stable from 1992 to 2000 at 62 percent of the population , it had fallen to 54 percent by 2006 , researchers found .
that corresponds to a decrease from 49 to 44 million people in the middle-income range . in the period from 1996 to 2006 , the number of wealthy people earning more than 200 percent of the average income level went from 6.4 to 9.2 percent and the number of poor earning less than 50 percent of the average increased from 7.3 to 11.4 percent . old-age poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty among the elderly is a big concern for women according to a survey by the emnid research institute published in the bild am sonntag newspaper , almost three-quarters of germans think that in a few years , poverty among the elderly will be the biggest problem the country faces . the poll found that 73 percent thought the days of expecting a comfortable retirement with a state-provided pension were soon to be a thing of the past .
the concern is especially acute among women and those between 50 and 64 years of age , the paper said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the two months since the end of february , when there was a change in the law , 137 businesses were caught employing illegal immigrants .
this is 10 times the number caught in 2007 , and more than double the number prosecuted in the previous decade .
employers face fines of up to £ 10,000 for each illegal immigrant they employ .
in the last two months fines of about £ 500,000 have been handed out .
persistent offenders also face a jail sentence .
" there are dodgy employers out there who are trying to undercut their competitors and drive down british wages by employing people illegally , so we 've come up with this new way of taking much faster on-the-spot action , " immigration minister liam byrne told the bbc . "
it 's quite clear that this new regime , which is part of a big shake-up of britain 's border security , is already beginning to work " liam byrne immigration minister " it 's quite clear that this new regime , which is part of a big shake-up of britain 's border security , is already beginning to work . "
to see the policy in action the bbc was invited out on an enforcement operation with officers from the uk border agency .
about 60 officers , backed up by the police , walked into a chicken processing factory in derbyshire .
police intelligence had suggested that illegal immigrants were working there .
in a large processing room 56 workers , all of them from overseas , were preparing chicken pieces for the retail trade .
uk ba officers burst into the room , shouting loudly and telling the workers to put their knives down .
the shocked workers were lined up against a wall and told they would be questioned to see if they were in the country legally .
after several hours of questioning it was determined that 22 of the workers were illegal immigrants .
fingerprints were taken and paperwork examined .
the illegal immigrants , from a variety of countries including afghanistan , pakistan and india , were led out of the building in handcuffs and taken to police stations .
the rest of the workers were sent home .
investigations into the owners of the company are ongoing and so far no fines have been levied .
employers are given an opportunity to respond or explain why illegal immigrants were working for them .
if no satisfactory excuse is forthcoming sizeable fines can follow .
it is not always easy for employers to tell whether someone is in the country legally .
the bbc spoke to one man , a restaurant owner in the home counties , who was recently fined £ 6,000 after four illegal immigrants were found working in his kitchen during a raid .
faisal ahmed told us that two of the men had only started working the day before and had provided p45 payment documents from their previous employer and had national insurance numbers .
he said he assumed they were here legally .
forgeries the uk ba now provides a phone number which employers can use to check the status of potential employees .
" if anyone comes here with a british passport how do i know if this is a fake passport ? " he asked .
" i have n't got any kind of machine to check it .
now the court has given me some documents showing me how to check if i think there 's anything dodgy . "
since february there has been a 40 % increase in the numbers of uk ba enforcement operations .
indian restaurant owners have started complaining that they are being targeted in the crackdown .
raids often take place in the evening when restaurants are busy with customers .
they have to be closed down while the operations are under way and diners are sent home . "
we 've got to sustain this over time and employers have got to realise that this is not a short cut to cutting costs " chris huhne liberal democrat restaurant owners say it is giving them a bad reputation at a time when they are finding it hard to recruit chefs from overseas because of much tighter immigration restrictions .
the government is facing a major problem in dealing with the illegal immigrants rounded up in enforcement operations .
only two of the 22 arrested on the raid on the chicken processing plant were deported immediately .
deportation costs it can take months to locate the necessary paperwork for deportations and some can not be deported at all if they come from countries where it is unsafe to return them .
according to the national audit office , it costs £ 11,000 per person to deport them .
with an estimated total of more than 500,000 illegal immigrants in britain , the government is facing a bill of more than £ 5bn to deport them all - if they can catch them .

a swoop on illegal workers at a chicken processing plant there has been a dramatic increase in the number of employers being prosecuted for hiring illegal immigrants , the bbc has learned .
in the two months since the end of february , when there was a change in the law , 137 businesses were caught employing illegal immigrants .
this is 10 times the number caught in 2007 , and more than double the number prosecuted in the previous decade .
employers face fines of up to £ 10,000 for each illegal immigrant they employ .
in the last two months fines of about £ 500,000 have been handed out .
persistent offenders also face a jail sentence .
" there are dodgy employers out there who are trying to undercut their competitors and drive down british wages by employing people illegally , so we 've come up with this new way of taking much faster on-the-spot action , " immigration minister liam byrne told the bbc .

"
to see the policy in action the bbc was invited out on an enforcement operation with officers from the uk border agency .
about 60 officers , backed up by the police , walked into a chicken processing factory in derbyshire .
police intelligence had suggested that illegal immigrants were working there .
in a large processing room 56 workers , all of them from overseas , were preparing chicken pieces for the retail trade .
uk ba officers burst into the room , shouting loudly and telling the workers to put their knives down .
the shocked workers were lined up against a wall and told they would be questioned to see if they were in the country legally .
immigration minister liam byrne praised the successes after several hours of questioning it was determined that 22 of the workers were illegal immigrants .
fingerprints were taken and paperwork examined .
the illegal immigrants , from a variety of countries including afghanistan , pakistan and india , were led out of the building in handcuffs and taken to police stations .
the rest of the workers were sent home .
investigations into the owners of the company are ongoing and so far no fines have been levied .
employers are given an opportunity to respond or explain why illegal immigrants were working for them .
if no satisfactory excuse is forthcoming sizeable fines can follow .
it is not always easy for employers to tell whether someone is in the country legally .
the bbc spoke to one man , a restaurant owner in the home counties , who was recently fined £ 6,000 after four illegal immigrants were found working in his kitchen during a raid .
faisal ahmed told us that two of the men had only started working the day before and had provided p45 payment documents from their previous employer and had national insurance numbers .
he said he assumed they were here legally .
forgeries the uk ba now provides a phone number which employers can use to check the status of potential employees .
" if anyone comes here with a british passport how do i know if this is a fake passport ? " he asked .
" i have n't got any kind of machine to check it .
now the court has given me some documents showing me how to check if i think there 's anything dodgy . "
since february there has been a 40 % increase in the numbers of uk ba enforcement operations .
indian restaurant owners have started complaining that they are being targeted in the crackdown .
raids often take place in the evening when restaurants are busy with customers .
they have to be closed down while the operations are under way and diners are sent home .

the government is facing a major problem in dealing with the illegal immigrants rounded up in enforcement operations .
only two of the 22 arrested on the raid on the chicken processing plant were deported immediately .
deportation costs it can take months to locate the necessary paperwork for deportations and some can not be deported at all if they come from countries where it is unsafe to return them .
employers claim it is hard to spot faked passports according to the national audit office , it costs £ 11,000 per person to deport them .
with an estimated total of more than 500,000 illegal immigrants in britain , the government is facing a bill of more than £ 5bn to deport them all - if they can catch them .

a swoop on illegal workers at a chicken processing plant there has been a dramatic increase in the number of employers being prosecuted for hiring illegal immigrants , the bbc has learned .
in the two months since the end of february , when there was a change in the law , 137 businesses were caught employing illegal immigrants .
this is 10 times the number caught in 2007 , and more than double the number prosecuted in the previous decade .
employers face fines of up to £ 10,000 for each illegal immigrant they employ .
in the last two months fines of about £ 500,000 have been handed out .
persistent offenders also face a jail sentence .
" there are dodgy employers out there who are trying to undercut their competitors and drive down british wages by employing people illegally , so we 've come up with this new way of taking much faster on-the-spot action , " immigration minister liam byrne told the bbc .
it 's quite clear that this new regime , which is part of a big shake-up of britain 's border security , is already beginning to work liam byrne immigration minister " it 's quite clear that this new regime , which is part of a big shake-up of britain 's border security , is already beginning to work . "
to see the policy in action the bbc was invited out on an enforcement operation with officers from the uk border agency .
about 60 officers , backed up by the police , walked into a chicken processing factory in derbyshire .
police intelligence had suggested that illegal immigrants were working there .
in a large processing room 56 workers , all of them from overseas , were preparing chicken pieces for the retail trade .
uk ba officers burst into the room , shouting loudly and telling the workers to put their knives down .
the shocked workers were lined up against a wall and told they would be questioned to see if they were in the country legally .
immigration minister liam byrne praised the successes after several hours of questioning it was determined that 22 of the workers were illegal immigrants .
fingerprints were taken and paperwork examined .
the illegal immigrants , from a variety of countries including afghanistan , pakistan and india , were led out of the building in handcuffs and taken to police stations .
the rest of the workers were sent home .
investigations into the owners of the company are ongoing and so far no fines have been levied .
employers are given an opportunity to respond or explain why illegal immigrants were working for them .
if no satisfactory excuse is forthcoming sizeable fines can follow .
it is not always easy for employers to tell whether someone is in the country legally .
the bbc spoke to one man , a restaurant owner in the home counties , who was recently fined £ 6,000 after four illegal immigrants were found working in his kitchen during a raid .
faisal ahmed told us that two of the men had only started working the day before and had provided p45 payment documents from their previous employer and had national insurance numbers .
he said he assumed they were here legally .
forgeries the uk ba now provides a phone number which employers can use to check the status of potential employees .
" if anyone comes here with a british passport how do i know if this is a fake passport ? " he asked .
" i have n't got any kind of machine to check it .
now the court has given me some documents showing me how to check if i think there 's anything dodgy . "
since february there has been a 40 % increase in the numbers of uk ba enforcement operations .
indian restaurant owners have started complaining that they are being targeted in the crackdown .
raids often take place in the evening when restaurants are busy with customers .
they have to be closed down while the operations are under way and diners are sent home .
we 've got to sustain this over time and employers have got to realise that this is not a short cut to cutting costs chris huhne liberal democrat restaurant owners say it is giving them a bad reputation at a time when they are finding it hard to recruit chefs from overseas because of much tighter immigration restrictions .
the government is facing a major problem in dealing with the illegal immigrants rounded up in enforcement operations .
only two of the 22 arrested on the raid on the chicken processing plant were deported immediately .
deportation costs it can take months to locate the necessary paperwork for deportations and some can not be deported at all if they come from countries where it is unsafe to return them .
employers claim it is hard to spot faked passports according to the national audit office , it costs £ 11,000 per person to deport them .
with an estimated total of more than 500,000 illegal immigrants in britain , the government is facing a bill of more than £ 5bn to deport them all - if they can catch them .
last year 63,140 people were removed from the country .
the conservatives said the government was " painfully slow " in dealing with the issue .
shadow immigration minister damian green said : " ten times a minuscule number is still a small number . "
the liberal democrats welcomed the government 's new crackdown on employers , but said it was long overdue .
" if we are going to be effective in reducing the pull factor of employers employing illegal immigrants then it 's not good enough just to have a little blitz with a few prosecutions in one year , " said chris huhne , the party 's home affairs spokesman .

a swoop on illegal workers at a chicken processing plant there has been a dramatic increase in the number of employers being prosecuted for hiring illegal immigrants , the bbc has learned .
in the two months since the end of february , when there was a change in the law , 137 businesses were caught employing illegal immigrants .
this is 10 times the number caught in 2007 , and more than double the number prosecuted in the previous decade .
employers face fines of up to £ 10,000 for each illegal immigrant they employ .
in the last two months fines of about £ 500,000 have been handed out .
persistent offenders also face a jail sentence .
" there are dodgy employers out there who are trying to undercut their competitors and drive down british wages by employing people illegally , so we 've come up with this new way of taking much faster on-the-spot action , " immigration minister liam byrne told the bbc .
it 's quite clear that this new regime , which is part of a big shake-up of britain 's border security , is already beginning to work liam byrne immigration minister " it 's quite clear that this new regime , which is part of a big shake-up of britain 's border security , is already beginning to work . "
to see the policy in action the bbc was invited out on an enforcement operation with officers from the uk border agency .
about 60 officers , backed up by the police , walked into a chicken processing factory in derbyshire .
police intelligence had suggested that illegal immigrants were working there .
in a large processing room 56 workers , all of them from overseas , were preparing chicken pieces for the retail trade .
uk ba officers burst into the room , shouting loudly and telling the workers to put their knives down .
the shocked workers were lined up against a wall and told they would be questioned to see if they were in the country legally .
immigration minister liam byrne praised the successes after several hours of questioning it was determined that 22 of the workers were illegal immigrants .
fingerprints were taken and paperwork examined .
the illegal immigrants , from a variety of countries including afghanistan , pakistan and india , were led out of the building in handcuffs and taken to police stations .
the rest of the workers were sent home .
investigations into the owners of the company are ongoing and so far no fines have been levied .
employers are given an opportunity to respond or explain why illegal immigrants were working for them .
if no satisfactory excuse is forthcoming sizeable fines can follow .
it is not always easy for employers to tell whether someone is in the country legally .
the bbc spoke to one man , a restaurant owner in the home counties , who was recently fined £ 6,000 after four illegal immigrants were found working in his kitchen during a raid .
faisal ahmed told us that two of the men had only started working the day before and had provided p45 payment documents from their previous employer and had national insurance numbers .
he said he assumed they were here legally .
forgeries the uk ba now provides a phone number which employers can use to check the status of potential employees .
" if anyone comes here with a british passport how do i know if this is a fake passport ? " he asked .
" i have n't got any kind of machine to check it .
now the court has given me some documents showing me how to check if i think there 's anything dodgy . "
since february there has been a 40 % increase in the numbers of uk ba enforcement operations .
indian restaurant owners have started complaining that they are being targeted in the crackdown .
raids often take place in the evening when restaurants are busy with customers .
they have to be closed down while the operations are under way and diners are sent home .
we 've got to sustain this over time and employers have got to realise that this is not a short cut to cutting costs chris huhne liberal democrat restaurant owners say it is giving them a bad reputation at a time when they are finding it hard to recruit chefs from overseas because of much tighter immigration restrictions .
the government is facing a major problem in dealing with the illegal immigrants rounded up in enforcement operations .
only two of the 22 arrested on the raid on the chicken processing plant were deported immediately .
deportation costs it can take months to locate the necessary paperwork for deportations and some can not be deported at all if they come from countries where it is unsafe to return them .
employers claim it is hard to spot faked passports according to the national audit office , it costs £ 11,000 per person to deport them .
with an estimated total of more than 500,000 illegal immigrants in britain , the government is facing a bill of more than £ 5bn to deport them all - if they can catch them .
last year 63,140 people were removed from the country .
the conservatives said the government was " painfully slow " in dealing with the issue .

" if we are going to be effective in reducing the pull factor of employers employing illegal immigrants then it 's not good enough just to have a little blitz with a few prosecutions in one year , " said chris huhne , the party 's home affairs spokesman .
" we 've got to sustain this over time and employers have got to realise that this is not a short cut to cutting costs . "
