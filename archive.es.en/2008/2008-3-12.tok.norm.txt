program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the royals are using their art collection to take revenge . if germany will work with stolen bank secrets , we 're not so sure our art is safe there .
that 's what members of liechtenstein 's royal household must have been thinking when they decided to cancel a planned exhibition in munich . " the princely collections will abstain from making loans available to germany as long as the application of fundamental principles of the rule of law by the federal republic seems questionable as far as liechtenstein is concerned , " reads a statement from the prince 's office .
all other art loans have also been put on hold for the time being . tit for tax scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein officials feel the data theft violated their sovereignty the move comes after a massive scandal involving rich germans who have set up foundations in liechtenstein to avoid paying taxes at home .
german officials apparently paid more than four million euros -lrb- $ 6.14 million -rrb- for data on the tax culprits that had been stolen from a liechtenstein bank . the subsequent investigation has led to the downfall of one of germany 's most prominent business leaders , klaus zumwinkel , who resigned from his position as ceo of deutsche post . some 600 other germans also appear on the list of tax evaders , and many more countries , including the united states , britain and australia , have begun checking the data for the names of their own citizens . bye-bye , biedermeier at munich 's neue pinakothek museum , where some 60 paintings and 120 drawings from liechtenstein had been scheduled to go on display in an exhibition of viennese biedermeier art on may 25 , curator herbert rott was clearly disappointed by liechtenstein 's loan boycott . " needless to say it 's bitter that we 've been hit like that , " he said , according to ap news service .
rott added that he hoped the show could be restaged at a later date . according to information on the official web site of liechtenstein 's art collections , the princely treasures include major european works of art spanning five centuries . " they are among the world 's most important private collections of art today , " according to a statement on the web site . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " quaero " search engine project involves 23 companies led by french technology giant thomson .
quaero , which is latin for " i search , " has n't yet got off the ground due to a lack of funding .
its estimated costs for the first five years are projected at 199 million euros , half of which france - which has championed the idea - has agreed to fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's chirac stood behind the idea for quaero the quaero project made headlines in 2005 , when france and germany proposed a search engine to take on the all-powerful , english-language based , google , which opponents felt was developing a dangerous de-facto monopoly on internet information .
following an " in-depth examination , " the european commission decided that the quaero project " brings positive externalities for the community as a whole . "
eu allows " limited " competition distortion however quaero " is not spontaneously underpinned by the market owing to divergent interests within the consortium and to uncertainties regarding the project 's chances of success , " the eu 's executive arm said in a statement .
any resultant distortions in competition " should be limited , " it added .
" we are confident that the positive contribution the program will make to european research will outweigh any distortion of competition caused by the aid , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
thomson 's targeted clients for quaero are internet network operators , content distributors and film production studios .
when developed , it will be available for personal computers , mobile phones , televisions and other platforms .
initial plan gone awry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia is also trying to compete against google the project met with criticism after it was unveiled by then-french president jacques chirac .
search engine experts cited by the financial times called the plan " a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism , " with the main critique being that by the time of quaero 's launch , the search engine market will be a generation ahead of quaero in media and device capabilities .
finally , in late 2006 some of the german developers left the project , deciding to work on a scaled-down version of their search engine , called " theseus , " named after the greek mythological figure who found his way out of the minotaur 's maze . ultimately , the french and german sides diverged over the basic concept of what a new search engine should focus on , news reports said .
the germans wanted to emphasize word-based searches , whereas the french side focused on multimedia .
china , japan also aim to compete speaking in 2006 when the split occurred , francois bourdoncle , ceo of french company exalead , said : " germany 's withdrawal reflects mainly one fact : the orientation that germany wanted for the project was not along the same lines as the one that france favored .

the " quaero " search engine project involves 23 companies led by french technology giant thomson .
quaero , which is latin for " i search , " has n't yet got off the ground due to a lack of funding .
its estimated costs for the first five years are projected at 199 million euros , half of which france - which has championed the idea - has agreed to fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's chirac stood behind the idea for quaero the quaero project made headlines in 2005 , when france and germany proposed a search engine to take on the all-powerful , english-language based , google , which opponents felt was developing a dangerous de-facto monopoly on internet information .
following an " in-depth examination , " the european commission decided that the quaero project " brings positive externalities for the community as a whole . "
eu allows " limited " competition distortion however quaero " is not spontaneously underpinned by the market owing to divergent interests within the consortium and to uncertainties regarding the project 's chances of success , " the eu 's executive arm said in a statement .
any resultant distortions in competition " should be limited , " it added .
" we are confident that the positive contribution the program will make to european research will outweigh any distortion of competition caused by the aid , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
thomson 's targeted clients for quaero are internet network operators , content distributors and film production studios .
when developed , it will be available for personal computers , mobile phones , televisions and other platforms .
initial plan gone awry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia is also trying to compete against google the project met with criticism after it was unveiled by then-french president jacques chirac .
search engine experts cited by the financial times called the plan " a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism , " with the main critique being that by the time of quaero 's launch , the search engine market will be a generation ahead of quaero in media and device capabilities .
finally , in late 2006 some of the german developers left the project , deciding to work on a scaled-down version of their search engine , called " theseus , " named after the greek mythological figure who found his way out of the minotaur 's maze . ultimately , the french and german sides diverged over the basic concept of what a new search engine should focus on , news reports said .
the germans wanted to emphasize word-based searches , whereas the french side focused on multimedia .
china , japan also aim to compete speaking in 2006 when the split occurred , francois bourdoncle , ceo of french company exalead , said : " germany 's withdrawal reflects mainly one fact : the orientation that germany wanted for the project was not along the same lines as the one that france favored . "
the european commission last year approved a german aid scheme for theseus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's been a basic principle since the bundeswehr 's inception that supervisors can not touch their soldiers , let alone give them electric shocks , infuse water or do other things , " gertz said , according to ap news service . victims remain silent gertz added that this was the case even if some recruits had described simulated hostage takings as " highlights " of their military training . apparently , recruits had also been given a code word to stop the exercise at any time , but none made use of it as they feared that they would be seen as weak by their comrades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recruits should stand up for their basic rights , robbe said reinhold robbe , the german parliament 's bundeswehr commissioner , meanwhile said he had been shocked by the behavior of recruits following the abuse . in an interview with german public radio , robbe said none of the victims had filed a complaint and that the abuse only became known by coincidence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 12.03.2008 eu allows france to bankroll google rival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking on google is a big job - and now france is trying to do it plans to build competition for search-engine google got a boost when the eu said it would help france fund competitor quaero . the eu 's competition watchdog approved 99 million euros -lrb- $ 152 million -rrb- in french state aid aimed at building a european rival to us internet search engine google .
the " quaero " search engine project involves 23 companies led by french technology giant thomson .
quaero , which is latin for " i search , " has n't yet got off the ground due to a lack of funding .
its estimated costs for the first five years are projected at 199 million euros , half of which france - which has championed the idea - has agreed to fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's chirac stood behind the idea for quaero the quaero project made headlines in 2005 , when france and germany proposed a search engine to take on the all-powerful , english-language based , google , which opponents felt was developing a dangerous de-facto monopoly on internet information .
following an " in-depth examination , " the european commission decided that the quaero project " brings positive externalities for the community as a whole . "
eu allows " limited " competition distortion however quaero " is not spontaneously underpinned by the market owing to divergent interests within the consortium and to uncertainties regarding the project 's chances of success , " the eu 's executive arm said in a statement .
any resultant distortions in competition " should be limited , " it added .
" we are confident that the positive contribution the program will make to european research will outweigh any distortion of competition caused by the aid , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
thomson 's targeted clients for quaero are internet network operators , content distributors and film production studios .
when developed , it will be available for personal computers , mobile phones , televisions and other platforms .
initial plan gone awry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia is also trying to compete against google the project met with criticism after it was unveiled by then-french president jacques chirac .
search engine experts cited by the financial times called the plan " a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism , " with the main critique being that by the time of quaero 's launch , the search engine market will be a generation ahead of quaero in media and device capabilities .
finally , in late 2006 some of the german developers left the project , deciding to work on a scaled-down version of their search engine , called " theseus , " named after the greek mythological figure who found his way out of the minotaur 's maze . ultimately , the french and german sides diverged over the basic concept of what a new search engine should focus on , news reports said .
the germans wanted to emphasize word-based searches , whereas the french side focused on multimedia .
china , japan also aim to compete speaking in 2006 when the split occurred , francois bourdoncle , ceo of french company exalead , said : " germany 's withdrawal reflects mainly one fact : the orientation that germany wanted for the project was not along the same lines as the one that france favored . "
the european commission last year approved a german aid scheme for theseus .

according to documents , he had already died 11 years earlier in sao paolo . while the bavarian officials were understandably surprised about the mode of transport , they did allow the women to continue their journey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 12.03.2008 europe struggles to end us visa restrictions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us are having difficulty getting the winds of travel blowing in the same direction visa-free travel to the united states remains one area in which not all eu countries are treated equally .
a growing number of side deals are undercutting the bloc 's efforts to negotiate a collective policy . estonia and latvia want their citizens to be able to travel to the united states without having to apply for a visa first .
the " visa waiver " program is a comfort citizens from 15 european countries , including germany , have enjoyed for years .
but as the eu has grown , the us has been reluctant to extend the same welcome to new members , forcing many eu citizens to apply for visas even for short business trips or holidays to the us . the pair of baltic countries signed separate bilateral agreements with the us on wednesday , march 12 , which start both countries down the road to easy trans-atlantic travel .
the czech republic already has a similar agreement with the us , and lithuania , slovakia and hungary hoped to sign deals " as soon as possible , " a lithuanian diplomat said wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not always easy to get a visa but the deals could erode the eu 's attempt to negotiate easier travel for all of its 27 member states .
the european commission warned member states against separate negotiations , saying that this would undercut the eu 's collective bargaining power .
the eu is also worried that countries will agree to give the us too much personal data about airline passengers , which us authorities say is needed for security reasons . estonia , latvia not willing to wait but estonia and latvia said they decided to sign bilateral deals rather than wait out lengthy negotiations between brussels and washington . " why should our citizens wait for some unique agreement involving all member states ?
the free movement of our citizens is one of the interests of our country , " latvian foreign minister maris riekstins said . the visa regulations have been a sore point for those not in the " visa waiver " program , most of them ex-communist countries which have become vocal us supporters since breaking away from moscow 's sphere of influence at the end of the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu countries do n't want to wait estonia and latvia left the soviet union in 1991 and joined the eu and nato in 2004 .
they have supplied troops for the us-led military campaigns in iraq and afghanistan . us entry rules are linked to american concerns that citizens from poor countries will use tourist visas to immigrate illegally to the us .
but estonia and latvia have shown they 're worthy of a waiver , us homeland security secretary michael chertoff told reporters . " this is a milestone occasion , a major step forward , " he added . eu wants to take the lead the european commission began its own visa-free travel negotiations with the us on wednesday .
european commission vice president franco frattini urged member states to stop separate visa negotiations with the us , which he called an area " of european responsibility . " " i would expect on the basis of a common approach that european union member states stop negotiating with the united states in eu fields " of jurisdiction , he told reporters . speaking on the sidelines of an eu ministerial conference in slovenia , frattini said the eu ambassadors of the 27 member states had unanimously agreed on a common approach to the exploratory talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german passport like this will get you into the us the issue is expected to top the agenda of thursday 's eu-us justice meeting with michael chertoff in slovenia , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
us officials said they would continue making bilateral deals with eu members . " we have arrangements that we are working out with individual member states , and i would expect that that is going to continue absent some sort of agreement within the eu to the contrary , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack said .
" if the eu has some dispute internal to the eu , then the eu needs to work that out . " speaking at the end of the ministerial conference at brdo castle , frattini said wednesday that the travel memorandums signed latvia and estonia " should not be considered as operational documents , rather as political ones . " " no member state will be implementing political memorandums -lsb- bilaterally signed with the us -rsb- on areas that are under eu responsibility , " frattini told reporters , before admitting he could do little to stop them from doing so . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austrian newsstands this year are selling papers published during the time of nazi rule .
the project shows how local and foreign press saw the era . a grainy image of a procession of uniformed nazis marching somberly through the center of austria 's capital covers the front page of the daily neuigkeits-welt-blatt above the headline " the ' day of the legion ' in vienna . " " everywhere heart-felt rallies were given for the legionnaires , the self-sacrificing pioneers of the national socialist movement in german-austria , " the caption reads . the legionnaires had indeed had their day , as they could finally admit publicly to their allegiance to the previously banned nazi party without fear of reprisals .
the national socialists were fully in control and gleichschaltung , the forced coordination of austrian society , was well underway , just three weeks after nazi germany 's annexation of its neighbor , on march 12 , 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspapers are accompanied by explanatory texts the neuigkeits-welt-blatt may no longer exist , but it 's received tens of thousands of new readers due to a newspaper project running throughout 2008 , the 70th anniversary of the nazi power grab in austria .
in 52 weekly editions , " nachrichten " aims to show how the domestic and international media portrayed austria under the national socialists . eyewitness insights each edition of " nachrichten " is made up of two facsimiles of original newspapers , which are folded into an oversized cover printed with explanatory texts that provide background and context to understand the papers ' articles . the name " nachrichten " is a play on the word for " news , " nachrichten .
taken separately , nach means " after " and richten means " to judge . " but the idea is n't that people should pass judgment , said fritz hausjell , the project 's head of research and a professor of communications history at the university of vienna .
it 's meant to give people a sense of how the contemporaneous press interpreted nazi austria from both inside and outside the country . " we want to show how the media was used to facilitate this system , how the construction of reality was facilitated by the media , " hausjell said . the initiative stems from british publisher albertas ltd , which has done similar projects in denmark , finland , greece and spain , and puts out " nachrichten " in cooperation with austria 's national library and the documentation center of austrian resistance . little need for coercion one of the nazis ' first steps in consolidating power was to take control of the media , which happened overnight , as they occupied editorial offices throughout the country .
by june 1939 , journalists could only work if they were certified " aryans . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hausjell and his team choose a different topic for each issue austrians had largely welcomed hitler 's wehrmacht when it marched into the country in 1938 .
and the press could already look back on a well-developed anti-semitic tradition , hausjell pointed out . " it was striking that the austrian journalists were especially ruthless even to the point of being counterproductive , " hausjell said .
" the readiness to comply -lsb- among the press -rsb- was amazingly high . " around 125,000 austrian jews fled the country to escape the nazis .
many ended up in mauthausen , the country 's biggest concentration camp , where nearly 200,000 people were held prisoner between 1938 and 1945 , around half of whom were killed there .
about 65,000 of the 6 million jews killed in the holocaust were austrian . foolhardy allies but after the war , the country was slow to acknowledge its embrace of nazi germany and its complicity in nazi crimes . " the austrians were given a convenient let-out as the ' first victims of hitler , " ' explained historian robert knight , a specialist in austria as a " post-nazi " society at loughborough university in england . the allies had , in 1943 , declared austria " the first victim of hitlerite aggression . "
their aim had been to encourage austrian resistance .
instead they provided the country with an excuse to live in denial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only half of the almost 200,000 people held in mauthausen survived it took decades , and both international and domestic pressure , for austria to own up to its past .
nowadays , though , the notion that austria was an accessory to nazi germany has become generally accepted . " there are still pockets of reluctance , " knight said .
" but the consensus has moved in a critical direction .
the mainstream has changed .
in some ways it is a catching-up process with west germany . " unexpected demand the interest in " nachrichten " so far indicates that austrians do want to know more about their dark past . initially published in an edition of 50,000 , albertas had to print an additional 8,000 copies of the first issue to satisfy demand .
although after six weeks it 's still too early to say whether the project is a success , the fact that austria 's two largest supermarket chains ordered it to complement their sales mix , suggests it is . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the royals are using their art collection to take revenge . if germany will work with stolen bank secrets , we 're not so sure our art is safe there .
that 's what members of liechtenstein 's royal household must have been thinking when they decided to cancel a planned exhibition in munich . " the princely collections will abstain from making loans available to germany as long as the application of fundamental principles of the rule of law by the federal republic seems questionable as far as liechtenstein is concerned , " reads a statement from the prince 's office .
all other art loans have also been put on hold for the time being . tit for tax scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein officials feel the data theft violated their sovereignty the move comes after a massive scandal involving rich germans who have set up foundations in liechtenstein to avoid paying taxes at home .
german officials apparently paid more than four million euros -lrb- $ 6.14 million -rrb- for data on the tax culprits that had been stolen from a liechtenstein bank . the subsequent investigation has led to the downfall of one of germany 's most prominent business leaders , klaus zumwinkel , who resigned from his position as ceo of deutsche post . some 600 other germans also appear on the list of tax evaders , and many more countries , including the united states , britain and australia , have begun checking the data for the names of their own citizens . bye-bye , biedermeier at munich 's neue pinakothek museum , where some 60 paintings and 120 drawings from liechtenstein had been scheduled to go on display in an exhibition of viennese biedermeier art on may 25 , curator herbert rott was clearly disappointed by liechtenstein 's loan boycott .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 12.03.2008 eu allows france to bankroll google rival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking on google is a big job - and now france is trying to do it plans to build competition for search-engine google got a boost when the eu said it would help france fund competitor quaero . the eu 's competition watchdog approved 99 million euros -lrb- $ 152 million -rrb- in french state aid aimed at building a european rival to us internet search engine google .
the " quaero " search engine project involves 23 companies led by french technology giant thomson .
quaero , which is latin for " i search , " has n't yet got off the ground due to a lack of funding .
its estimated costs for the first five years are projected at 199 million euros , half of which france - which has championed the idea - has agreed to fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's chirac stood behind the idea for quaero the quaero project made headlines in 2005 , when france and germany proposed a search engine to take on the all-powerful , english-language based , google , which opponents felt was developing a dangerous de-facto monopoly on internet information .
following an " in-depth examination , " the european commission decided that the quaero project " brings positive externalities for the community as a whole . "
eu allows " limited " competition distortion however quaero " is not spontaneously underpinned by the market owing to divergent interests within the consortium and to uncertainties regarding the project 's chances of success , " the eu 's executive arm said in a statement .
any resultant distortions in competition " should be limited , " it added .
" we are confident that the positive contribution the program will make to european research will outweigh any distortion of competition caused by the aid , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
thomson 's targeted clients for quaero are internet network operators , content distributors and film production studios .
when developed , it will be available for personal computers , mobile phones , televisions and other platforms .
initial plan gone awry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia is also trying to compete against google the project met with criticism after it was unveiled by then-french president jacques chirac .
search engine experts cited by the financial times called the plan " a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism , " with the main critique being that by the time of quaero 's launch , the search engine market will be a generation ahead of quaero in media and device capabilities .
finally , in late 2006 some of the german developers left the project , deciding to work on a scaled-down version of their search engine , called " theseus , " named after the greek mythological figure who found his way out of the minotaur 's maze . ultimately , the french and german sides diverged over the basic concept of what a new search engine should focus on , news reports said .
the germans wanted to emphasize word-based searches , whereas the french side focused on multimedia .
china , japan also aim to compete speaking in 2006 when the split occurred , francois bourdoncle , ceo of french company exalead , said : " germany 's withdrawal reflects mainly one fact : the orientation that germany wanted for the project was not along the same lines as the one that france favored . "
the european commission last year approved a german aid scheme for theseus .

oh , just a couple of old bones it 's not unusual for customs officers to have to deal with the occasional body .
usually , the deceased turn up in coffins .
two ladies , who recently stopped at munich airport , chose another container for a dead relative . when munich officers asked the two women to open their sealed suitcase , they discovered that the travelers , both in their 60s , had placed the skull and several bones of a man inside . flying to italy via munich from brazil , the women had brought along the man 's remains to fulfill his wish of finding his final resting place in italy .
according to documents , he had already died 11 years earlier in sao paolo . while the bavarian officials were understandably surprised about the mode of transport , they did allow the women to continue their journey .
after all , they had all the necessary documents to bring the bones to naples . and who 's to say that a koffer , or suitcase in german , ca n't work just as well as a coffin ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " quaero " search engine project involves 23 companies led by french technology giant thomson .
quaero , which is latin for " i search , " has n't yet got off the ground due to a lack of funding .
its estimated costs for the first five years are projected at 199 million euros , half of which france - which has championed the idea - has agreed to fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's chirac stood behind the idea for quaero the quaero project made headlines in 2005 , when france and germany proposed a search engine to take on the all-powerful , english-language based , google , which opponents felt was developing a dangerous de-facto monopoly on internet information .
following an " in-depth examination , " the european commission decided that the quaero project " brings positive externalities for the community as a whole . "
eu allows " limited " competition distortion however quaero " is not spontaneously underpinned by the market owing to divergent interests within the consortium and to uncertainties regarding the project 's chances of success , " the eu 's executive arm said in a statement .
any resultant distortions in competition " should be limited , " it added .
" we are confident that the positive contribution the program will make to european research will outweigh any distortion of competition caused by the aid , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
thomson 's targeted clients for quaero are internet network operators , content distributors and film production studios .
when developed , it will be available for personal computers , mobile phones , televisions and other platforms .

search engine experts cited by the financial times called the plan " a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism , " with the main critique being that by the time of quaero 's launch , the search engine market will be a generation ahead of quaero in media and device capabilities .
finally , in late 2006 some of the german developers left the project , deciding to work on a scaled-down version of their search engine , called " theseus , " named after the greek mythological figure who found his way out of the minotaur 's maze . ultimately , the french and german sides diverged over the basic concept of what a new search engine should focus on , news reports said .
the germans wanted to emphasize word-based searches , whereas the french side focused on multimedia .

the " quaero " search engine project involves 23 companies led by french technology giant thomson .
quaero , which is latin for " i search , " has n't yet got off the ground due to a lack of funding .
its estimated costs for the first five years are projected at 199 million euros , half of which france - which has championed the idea - has agreed to fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's chirac stood behind the idea for quaero the quaero project made headlines in 2005 , when france and germany proposed a search engine to take on the all-powerful , english-language based , google , which opponents felt was developing a dangerous de-facto monopoly on internet information .
following an " in-depth examination , " the european commission decided that the quaero project " brings positive externalities for the community as a whole . "
eu allows " limited " competition distortion however quaero " is not spontaneously underpinned by the market owing to divergent interests within the consortium and to uncertainties regarding the project 's chances of success , " the eu 's executive arm said in a statement .
any resultant distortions in competition " should be limited , " it added .
" we are confident that the positive contribution the program will make to european research will outweigh any distortion of competition caused by the aid , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
thomson 's targeted clients for quaero are internet network operators , content distributors and film production studios .
when developed , it will be available for personal computers , mobile phones , televisions and other platforms .
initial plan gone awry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia is also trying to compete against google the project met with criticism after it was unveiled by then-french president jacques chirac .
search engine experts cited by the financial times called the plan " a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism , " with the main critique being that by the time of quaero 's launch , the search engine market will be a generation ahead of quaero in media and device capabilities .
finally , in late 2006 some of the german developers left the project , deciding to work on a scaled-down version of their search engine , called " theseus , " named after the greek mythological figure who found his way out of the minotaur 's maze . ultimately , the french and german sides diverged over the basic concept of what a new search engine should focus on , news reports said .
the germans wanted to emphasize word-based searches , whereas the french side focused on multimedia .
china , japan also aim to compete speaking in 2006 when the split occurred , francois bourdoncle , ceo of french company exalead , said : " germany 's withdrawal reflects mainly one fact : the orientation that germany wanted for the project was not along the same lines as the one that france favored . "
the european commission last year approved a german aid scheme for theseus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a growing number of side deals are undercutting the bloc 's efforts to negotiate a collective policy . estonia and latvia want their citizens to be able to travel to the united states without having to apply for a visa first .
the " visa waiver " program is a comfort citizens from 15 european countries , including germany , have enjoyed for years .
but as the eu has grown , the us has been reluctant to extend the same welcome to new members , forcing many eu citizens to apply for visas even for short business trips or holidays to the us . the pair of baltic countries signed separate bilateral agreements with the us on wednesday , march 12 , which start both countries down the road to easy trans-atlantic travel .
the czech republic already has a similar agreement with the us , and lithuania , slovakia and hungary hoped to sign deals " as soon as possible , " a lithuanian diplomat said wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not always easy to get a visa but the deals could erode the eu 's attempt to negotiate easier travel for all of its 27 member states .
the european commission warned member states against separate negotiations , saying that this would undercut the eu 's collective bargaining power .
the eu is also worried that countries will agree to give the us too much personal data about airline passengers , which us authorities say is needed for security reasons . estonia , latvia not willing to wait but estonia and latvia said they decided to sign bilateral deals rather than wait out lengthy negotiations between brussels and washington . " why should our citizens wait for some unique agreement involving all member states ?
the free movement of our citizens is one of the interests of our country , " latvian foreign minister maris riekstins said . the visa regulations have been a sore point for those not in the " visa waiver " program , most of them ex-communist countries which have become vocal us supporters since breaking away from moscow 's sphere of influence at the end of the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu countries do n't want to wait estonia and latvia left the soviet union in 1991 and joined the eu and nato in 2004 .
they have supplied troops for the us-led military campaigns in iraq and afghanistan . us entry rules are linked to american concerns that citizens from poor countries will use tourist visas to immigrate illegally to the us .

" this is a milestone occasion , a major step forward , " he added . eu wants to take the lead the european commission began its own visa-free travel negotiations with the us on wednesday .
european commission vice president franco frattini urged member states to stop separate visa negotiations with the us , which he called an area " of european responsibility . " " i would expect on the basis of a common approach that european union member states stop negotiating with the united states in eu fields " of jurisdiction , he told reporters . speaking on the sidelines of an eu ministerial conference in slovenia , frattini said the eu ambassadors of the 27 member states had unanimously agreed on a common approach to the exploratory talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german passport like this will get you into the us the issue is expected to top the agenda of thursday 's eu-us justice meeting with michael chertoff in slovenia , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
us officials said they would continue making bilateral deals with eu members . " we have arrangements that we are working out with individual member states , and i would expect that that is going to continue absent some sort of agreement within the eu to the contrary , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack said .
" if the eu has some dispute internal to the eu , then the eu needs to work that out . " speaking at the end of the ministerial conference at brdo castle , frattini said wednesday that the travel memorandums signed latvia and estonia " should not be considered as operational documents , rather as political ones .

oh , just a couple of old bones it 's not unusual for customs officers to have to deal with the occasional body .
usually , the deceased turn up in coffins .
two ladies , who recently stopped at munich airport , chose another container for a dead relative . when munich officers asked the two women to open their sealed suitcase , they discovered that the travelers , both in their 60s , had placed the skull and several bones of a man inside . flying to italy via munich from brazil , the women had brought along the man 's remains to fulfill his wish of finding his final resting place in italy .
according to documents , he had already died 11 years earlier in sao paolo . while the bavarian officials were understandably surprised about the mode of transport , they did allow the women to continue their journey .
after all , they had all the necessary documents to bring the bones to naples . and who 's to say that a koffer , or suitcase in german , ca n't work just as well as a coffin ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" needless to say it 's bitter that we 've been hit like that , " he said , according to ap news service .
rott added that he hoped the show could be restaged at a later date . according to information on the official web site of liechtenstein 's art collections , the princely treasures include major european works of art spanning five centuries .

but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the verdict , experts said they were mostly concerned about the victim 's behavior after the incident . a court in the western german town of muenster ruled wednesday , march 12 , that the six men had abused 163 recruits during training sessions in the summer of 2004 . five men were sentenced to suspended prison sentences of up to 22 months .
the sixth defendant was ordered to pay a fine of 7,500 euros -lrb- $ 11,500 -rrb- .
they had been charged with several crimes , including causing bodily harm , abuse and demeaning treatment . the verdict concluded the lengthy trial , which had originally begun with 18 defendants .
three other men had already been given suspended prison sentence and fines at an earlier date .
the charges against the other defendants were dropped . a need for soul-searching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials will have to rethink training practices across the armed forces military experts meanwhile cautioned that while the trial had ended , germany 's bundeswehr still had work to do . bernhard gertz , the head of the federal armed forces association , which represents soldiers , said that disciplinary investigations into the case now had to find out if supervisors had violated their duties by not respecting the dignity of other human beings . " it 's been a basic principle since the bundeswehr 's inception that supervisors can not touch their soldiers , let alone give them electric shocks , infuse water or do other things , " gertz said , according to ap news service . victims remain silent gertz added that this was the case even if some recruits had described simulated hostage takings as " highlights " of their military training . apparently , recruits had also been given a code word to stop the exercise at any time , but none made use of it as they feared that they would be seen as weak by their comrades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recruits should stand up for their basic rights , robbe said reinhold robbe , the german parliament 's bundeswehr commissioner , meanwhile said he had been shocked by the behavior of recruits following the abuse . in an interview with german public radio , robbe said none of the victims had filed a complaint and that the abuse only became known by coincidence . " that 's what really made me think , " robbe said , adding that young recruits should remember that they did n't renounce their basic rights as citizens when they entered the army . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 12.03.2008 europe struggles to end us visa restrictions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us are having difficulty getting the winds of travel blowing in the same direction visa-free travel to the united states remains one area in which not all eu countries are treated equally .
a growing number of side deals are undercutting the bloc 's efforts to negotiate a collective policy . estonia and latvia want their citizens to be able to travel to the united states without having to apply for a visa first .
the " visa waiver " program is a comfort citizens from 15 european countries , including germany , have enjoyed for years .
but as the eu has grown , the us has been reluctant to extend the same welcome to new members , forcing many eu citizens to apply for visas even for short business trips or holidays to the us . the pair of baltic countries signed separate bilateral agreements with the us on wednesday , march 12 , which start both countries down the road to easy trans-atlantic travel .
the czech republic already has a similar agreement with the us , and lithuania , slovakia and hungary hoped to sign deals " as soon as possible , " a lithuanian diplomat said wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not always easy to get a visa but the deals could erode the eu 's attempt to negotiate easier travel for all of its 27 member states .
the european commission warned member states against separate negotiations , saying that this would undercut the eu 's collective bargaining power .
the eu is also worried that countries will agree to give the us too much personal data about airline passengers , which us authorities say is needed for security reasons . estonia , latvia not willing to wait but estonia and latvia said they decided to sign bilateral deals rather than wait out lengthy negotiations between brussels and washington . " why should our citizens wait for some unique agreement involving all member states ?
the free movement of our citizens is one of the interests of our country , " latvian foreign minister maris riekstins said . the visa regulations have been a sore point for those not in the " visa waiver " program , most of them ex-communist countries which have become vocal us supporters since breaking away from moscow 's sphere of influence at the end of the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu countries do n't want to wait estonia and latvia left the soviet union in 1991 and joined the eu and nato in 2004 .
they have supplied troops for the us-led military campaigns in iraq and afghanistan . us entry rules are linked to american concerns that citizens from poor countries will use tourist visas to immigrate illegally to the us .
but estonia and latvia have shown they 're worthy of a waiver , us homeland security secretary michael chertoff told reporters . " this is a milestone occasion , a major step forward , " he added . eu wants to take the lead the european commission began its own visa-free travel negotiations with the us on wednesday .
european commission vice president franco frattini urged member states to stop separate visa negotiations with the us , which he called an area " of european responsibility . " " i would expect on the basis of a common approach that european union member states stop negotiating with the united states in eu fields " of jurisdiction , he told reporters . speaking on the sidelines of an eu ministerial conference in slovenia , frattini said the eu ambassadors of the 27 member states had unanimously agreed on a common approach to the exploratory talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german passport like this will get you into the us the issue is expected to top the agenda of thursday 's eu-us justice meeting with michael chertoff in slovenia , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
us officials said they would continue making bilateral deals with eu members . " we have arrangements that we are working out with individual member states , and i would expect that that is going to continue absent some sort of agreement within the eu to the contrary , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack said .
" if the eu has some dispute internal to the eu , then the eu needs to work that out . " speaking at the end of the ministerial conference at brdo castle , frattini said wednesday that the travel memorandums signed latvia and estonia " should not be considered as operational documents , rather as political ones . " " no member state will be implementing political memorandums -lsb- bilaterally signed with the us -rsb- on areas that are under eu responsibility , " frattini told reporters , before admitting he could do little to stop them from doing so . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " quaero " search engine project involves 23 companies led by french technology giant thomson .
quaero , which is latin for " i search , " has n't yet got off the ground due to a lack of funding .
its estimated costs for the first five years are projected at 199 million euros , half of which france - which has championed the idea - has agreed to fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's chirac stood behind the idea for quaero the quaero project made headlines in 2005 , when france and germany proposed a search engine to take on the all-powerful , english-language based , google , which opponents felt was developing a dangerous de-facto monopoly on internet information .
following an " in-depth examination , " the european commission decided that the quaero project " brings positive externalities for the community as a whole . "
eu allows " limited " competition distortion however quaero " is not spontaneously underpinned by the market owing to divergent interests within the consortium and to uncertainties regarding the project 's chances of success , " the eu 's executive arm said in a statement .
any resultant distortions in competition " should be limited , " it added .
" we are confident that the positive contribution the program will make to european research will outweigh any distortion of competition caused by the aid , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
thomson 's targeted clients for quaero are internet network operators , content distributors and film production studios .
when developed , it will be available for personal computers , mobile phones , televisions and other platforms .
initial plan gone awry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia is also trying to compete against google the project met with criticism after it was unveiled by then-french president jacques chirac .
search engine experts cited by the financial times called the plan " a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism , " with the main critique being that by the time of quaero 's launch , the search engine market will be a generation ahead of quaero in media and device capabilities .
finally , in late 2006 some of the german developers left the project , deciding to work on a scaled-down version of their search engine , called " theseus , " named after the greek mythological figure who found his way out of the minotaur 's maze . ultimately , the french and german sides diverged over the basic concept of what a new search engine should focus on , news reports said .
the germans wanted to emphasize word-based searches , whereas the french side focused on multimedia .
china , japan also aim to compete speaking in 2006 when the split occurred , francois bourdoncle , ceo of french company exalead , said : " germany 's withdrawal reflects mainly one fact : the orientation that germany wanted for the project was not along the same lines as the one that france favored .

after the verdict , experts said they were mostly concerned about the victim 's behavior after the incident . a court in the western german town of muenster ruled wednesday , march 12 , that the six men had abused 163 recruits during training sessions in the summer of 2004 . five men were sentenced to suspended prison sentences of up to 22 months .
the sixth defendant was ordered to pay a fine of 7,500 euros -lrb- $ 11,500 -rrb- .
they had been charged with several crimes , including causing bodily harm , abuse and demeaning treatment . the verdict concluded the lengthy trial , which had originally begun with 18 defendants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the verdict , experts said they were mostly concerned about the victim 's behavior after the incident . a court in the western german town of muenster ruled wednesday , march 12 , that the six men had abused 163 recruits during training sessions in the summer of 2004 . five men were sentenced to suspended prison sentences of up to 22 months .

german officials apparently paid more than four million euros -lrb- $ 6.14 million -rrb- for data on the tax culprits that had been stolen from a liechtenstein bank . the subsequent investigation has led to the downfall of one of germany 's most prominent business leaders , klaus zumwinkel , who resigned from his position as ceo of deutsche post . some 600 other germans also appear on the list of tax evaders , and many more countries , including the united states , britain and australia , have begun checking the data for the names of their own citizens . bye-bye , biedermeier at munich 's neue pinakothek museum , where some 60 paintings and 120 drawings from liechtenstein had been scheduled to go on display in an exhibition of viennese biedermeier art on may 25 , curator herbert rott was clearly disappointed by liechtenstein 's loan boycott .

two ladies , who recently stopped at munich airport , chose another container for a dead relative . when munich officers asked the two women to open their sealed suitcase , they discovered that the travelers , both in their 60s , had placed the skull and several bones of a man inside . flying to italy via munich from brazil , the women had brought along the man 's remains to fulfill his wish of finding his final resting place in italy .
according to documents , he had already died 11 years earlier in sao paolo . while the bavarian officials were understandably surprised about the mode of transport , they did allow the women to continue their journey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austrian newsstands this year are selling papers published during the time of nazi rule .
the project shows how local and foreign press saw the era . a grainy image of a procession of uniformed nazis marching somberly through the center of austria 's capital covers the front page of the daily neuigkeits-welt-blatt above the headline " the ' day of the legion ' in vienna . " " everywhere heart-felt rallies were given for the legionnaires , the self-sacrificing pioneers of the national socialist movement in german-austria , " the caption reads . the legionnaires had indeed had their day , as they could finally admit publicly to their allegiance to the previously banned nazi party without fear of reprisals .
the national socialists were fully in control and gleichschaltung , the forced coordination of austrian society , was well underway , just three weeks after nazi germany 's annexation of its neighbor , on march 12 , 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspapers are accompanied by explanatory texts the neuigkeits-welt-blatt may no longer exist , but it 's received tens of thousands of new readers due to a newspaper project running throughout 2008 , the 70th anniversary of the nazi power grab in austria .
in 52 weekly editions , " nachrichten " aims to show how the domestic and international media portrayed austria under the national socialists . eyewitness insights each edition of " nachrichten " is made up of two facsimiles of original newspapers , which are folded into an oversized cover printed with explanatory texts that provide background and context to understand the papers ' articles . the name " nachrichten " is a play on the word for " news , " nachrichten .
taken separately , nach means " after " and richten means " to judge . " but the idea is n't that people should pass judgment , said fritz hausjell , the project 's head of research and a professor of communications history at the university of vienna .
it 's meant to give people a sense of how the contemporaneous press interpreted nazi austria from both inside and outside the country . " we want to show how the media was used to facilitate this system , how the construction of reality was facilitated by the media , " hausjell said . the initiative stems from british publisher albertas ltd , which has done similar projects in denmark , finland , greece and spain , and puts out " nachrichten " in cooperation with austria 's national library and the documentation center of austrian resistance . little need for coercion one of the nazis ' first steps in consolidating power was to take control of the media , which happened overnight , as they occupied editorial offices throughout the country .
by june 1939 , journalists could only work if they were certified " aryans . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hausjell and his team choose a different topic for each issue austrians had largely welcomed hitler 's wehrmacht when it marched into the country in 1938 .
and the press could already look back on a well-developed anti-semitic tradition , hausjell pointed out . " it was striking that the austrian journalists were especially ruthless even to the point of being counterproductive , " hausjell said .
" the readiness to comply -lsb- among the press -rsb- was amazingly high . " around 125,000 austrian jews fled the country to escape the nazis .
many ended up in mauthausen , the country 's biggest concentration camp , where nearly 200,000 people were held prisoner between 1938 and 1945 , around half of whom were killed there .
about 65,000 of the 6 million jews killed in the holocaust were austrian . foolhardy allies but after the war , the country was slow to acknowledge its embrace of nazi germany and its complicity in nazi crimes . " the austrians were given a convenient let-out as the ' first victims of hitler , " ' explained historian robert knight , a specialist in austria as a " post-nazi " society at loughborough university in england . the allies had , in 1943 , declared austria " the first victim of hitlerite aggression . "
their aim had been to encourage austrian resistance .
instead they provided the country with an excuse to live in denial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only half of the almost 200,000 people held in mauthausen survived it took decades , and both international and domestic pressure , for austria to own up to its past .
nowadays , though , the notion that austria was an accessory to nazi germany has become generally accepted . " there are still pockets of reluctance , " knight said .
" but the consensus has moved in a critical direction .
the mainstream has changed .
in some ways it is a catching-up process with west germany . " unexpected demand the interest in " nachrichten " so far indicates that austrians do want to know more about their dark past . initially published in an edition of 50,000 , albertas had to print an additional 8,000 copies of the first issue to satisfy demand .
although after six weeks it 's still too early to say whether the project is a success , the fact that austria 's two largest supermarket chains ordered it to complement their sales mix , suggests it is . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austrian newsstands this year are selling papers published during the time of nazi rule .
the project shows how local and foreign press saw the era . a grainy image of a procession of uniformed nazis marching somberly through the center of austria 's capital covers the front page of the daily neuigkeits-welt-blatt above the headline " the ' day of the legion ' in vienna . " " everywhere heart-felt rallies were given for the legionnaires , the self-sacrificing pioneers of the national socialist movement in german-austria , " the caption reads . the legionnaires had indeed had their day , as they could finally admit publicly to their allegiance to the previously banned nazi party without fear of reprisals .
the national socialists were fully in control and gleichschaltung , the forced coordination of austrian society , was well underway , just three weeks after nazi germany 's annexation of its neighbor , on march 12 , 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspapers are accompanied by explanatory texts the neuigkeits-welt-blatt may no longer exist , but it 's received tens of thousands of new readers due to a newspaper project running throughout 2008 , the 70th anniversary of the nazi power grab in austria .
in 52 weekly editions , " nachrichten " aims to show how the domestic and international media portrayed austria under the national socialists . eyewitness insights each edition of " nachrichten " is made up of two facsimiles of original newspapers , which are folded into an oversized cover printed with explanatory texts that provide background and context to understand the papers ' articles . the name " nachrichten " is a play on the word for " news , " nachrichten .
taken separately , nach means " after " and richten means " to judge . " but the idea is n't that people should pass judgment , said fritz hausjell , the project 's head of research and a professor of communications history at the university of vienna .
it 's meant to give people a sense of how the contemporaneous press interpreted nazi austria from both inside and outside the country . " we want to show how the media was used to facilitate this system , how the construction of reality was facilitated by the media , " hausjell said . the initiative stems from british publisher albertas ltd , which has done similar projects in denmark , finland , greece and spain , and puts out " nachrichten " in cooperation with austria 's national library and the documentation center of austrian resistance . little need for coercion one of the nazis ' first steps in consolidating power was to take control of the media , which happened overnight , as they occupied editorial offices throughout the country .
by june 1939 , journalists could only work if they were certified " aryans . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hausjell and his team choose a different topic for each issue austrians had largely welcomed hitler 's wehrmacht when it marched into the country in 1938 .
and the press could already look back on a well-developed anti-semitic tradition , hausjell pointed out . " it was striking that the austrian journalists were especially ruthless even to the point of being counterproductive , " hausjell said .
" the readiness to comply -lsb- among the press -rsb- was amazingly high . " around 125,000 austrian jews fled the country to escape the nazis .
many ended up in mauthausen , the country 's biggest concentration camp , where nearly 200,000 people were held prisoner between 1938 and 1945 , around half of whom were killed there .
about 65,000 of the 6 million jews killed in the holocaust were austrian . foolhardy allies but after the war , the country was slow to acknowledge its embrace of nazi germany and its complicity in nazi crimes . " the austrians were given a convenient let-out as the ' first victims of hitler , " ' explained historian robert knight , a specialist in austria as a " post-nazi " society at loughborough university in england . the allies had , in 1943 , declared austria " the first victim of hitlerite aggression . "
their aim had been to encourage austrian resistance .
instead they provided the country with an excuse to live in denial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only half of the almost 200,000 people held in mauthausen survived it took decades , and both international and domestic pressure , for austria to own up to its past .
nowadays , though , the notion that austria was an accessory to nazi germany has become generally accepted . " there are still pockets of reluctance , " knight said .
" but the consensus has moved in a critical direction .
the mainstream has changed .
in some ways it is a catching-up process with west germany . " unexpected demand the interest in " nachrichten " so far indicates that austrians do want to know more about their dark past . initially published in an edition of 50,000 , albertas had to print an additional 8,000 copies of the first issue to satisfy demand .
although after six weeks it 's still too early to say whether the project is a success , the fact that austria 's two largest supermarket chains ordered it to complement their sales mix , suggests it is . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

oh , just a couple of old bones it 's not unusual for customs officers to have to deal with the occasional body .
usually , the deceased turn up in coffins .
two ladies , who recently stopped at munich airport , chose another container for a dead relative . when munich officers asked the two women to open their sealed suitcase , they discovered that the travelers , both in their 60s , had placed the skull and several bones of a man inside . flying to italy via munich from brazil , the women had brought along the man 's remains to fulfill his wish of finding his final resting place in italy .
according to documents , he had already died 11 years earlier in sao paolo . while the bavarian officials were understandably surprised about the mode of transport , they did allow the women to continue their journey .
after all , they had all the necessary documents to bring the bones to naples . and who 's to say that a koffer , or suitcase in german , ca n't work just as well as a coffin ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 12.03.2008 eu allows france to bankroll google rival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking on google is a big job - and now france is trying to do it plans to build competition for search-engine google got a boost when the eu said it would help france fund competitor quaero . the eu 's competition watchdog approved 99 million euros -lrb- $ 152 million -rrb- in french state aid aimed at building a european rival to us internet search engine google .
the " quaero " search engine project involves 23 companies led by french technology giant thomson .
quaero , which is latin for " i search , " has n't yet got off the ground due to a lack of funding .
its estimated costs for the first five years are projected at 199 million euros , half of which france - which has championed the idea - has agreed to fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's chirac stood behind the idea for quaero the quaero project made headlines in 2005 , when france and germany proposed a search engine to take on the all-powerful , english-language based , google , which opponents felt was developing a dangerous de-facto monopoly on internet information .
following an " in-depth examination , " the european commission decided that the quaero project " brings positive externalities for the community as a whole . "
eu allows " limited " competition distortion however quaero " is not spontaneously underpinned by the market owing to divergent interests within the consortium and to uncertainties regarding the project 's chances of success , " the eu 's executive arm said in a statement .
any resultant distortions in competition " should be limited , " it added .
" we are confident that the positive contribution the program will make to european research will outweigh any distortion of competition caused by the aid , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
thomson 's targeted clients for quaero are internet network operators , content distributors and film production studios .
when developed , it will be available for personal computers , mobile phones , televisions and other platforms .
initial plan gone awry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia is also trying to compete against google the project met with criticism after it was unveiled by then-french president jacques chirac .
search engine experts cited by the financial times called the plan " a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism , " with the main critique being that by the time of quaero 's launch , the search engine market will be a generation ahead of quaero in media and device capabilities .
finally , in late 2006 some of the german developers left the project , deciding to work on a scaled-down version of their search engine , called " theseus , " named after the greek mythological figure who found his way out of the minotaur 's maze . ultimately , the french and german sides diverged over the basic concept of what a new search engine should focus on , news reports said .
the germans wanted to emphasize word-based searches , whereas the french side focused on multimedia .
china , japan also aim to compete speaking in 2006 when the split occurred , francois bourdoncle , ceo of french company exalead , said : " germany 's withdrawal reflects mainly one fact : the orientation that germany wanted for the project was not along the same lines as the one that france favored . "
the european commission last year approved a german aid scheme for theseus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austrian newsstands this year are selling papers published during the time of nazi rule .
the project shows how local and foreign press saw the era . a grainy image of a procession of uniformed nazis marching somberly through the center of austria 's capital covers the front page of the daily neuigkeits-welt-blatt above the headline " the ' day of the legion ' in vienna . " " everywhere heart-felt rallies were given for the legionnaires , the self-sacrificing pioneers of the national socialist movement in german-austria , " the caption reads . the legionnaires had indeed had their day , as they could finally admit publicly to their allegiance to the previously banned nazi party without fear of reprisals .
the national socialists were fully in control and gleichschaltung , the forced coordination of austrian society , was well underway , just three weeks after nazi germany 's annexation of its neighbor , on march 12 , 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspapers are accompanied by explanatory texts the neuigkeits-welt-blatt may no longer exist , but it 's received tens of thousands of new readers due to a newspaper project running throughout 2008 , the 70th anniversary of the nazi power grab in austria .
in 52 weekly editions , " nachrichten " aims to show how the domestic and international media portrayed austria under the national socialists . eyewitness insights each edition of " nachrichten " is made up of two facsimiles of original newspapers , which are folded into an oversized cover printed with explanatory texts that provide background and context to understand the papers ' articles . the name " nachrichten " is a play on the word for " news , " nachrichten .
taken separately , nach means " after " and richten means " to judge . " but the idea is n't that people should pass judgment , said fritz hausjell , the project 's head of research and a professor of communications history at the university of vienna .
it 's meant to give people a sense of how the contemporaneous press interpreted nazi austria from both inside and outside the country . " we want to show how the media was used to facilitate this system , how the construction of reality was facilitated by the media , " hausjell said . the initiative stems from british publisher albertas ltd , which has done similar projects in denmark , finland , greece and spain , and puts out " nachrichten " in cooperation with austria 's national library and the documentation center of austrian resistance . little need for coercion one of the nazis ' first steps in consolidating power was to take control of the media , which happened overnight , as they occupied editorial offices throughout the country .
by june 1939 , journalists could only work if they were certified " aryans . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hausjell and his team choose a different topic for each issue austrians had largely welcomed hitler 's wehrmacht when it marched into the country in 1938 .
and the press could already look back on a well-developed anti-semitic tradition , hausjell pointed out . " it was striking that the austrian journalists were especially ruthless even to the point of being counterproductive , " hausjell said .
" the readiness to comply -lsb- among the press -rsb- was amazingly high . " around 125,000 austrian jews fled the country to escape the nazis .
many ended up in mauthausen , the country 's biggest concentration camp , where nearly 200,000 people were held prisoner between 1938 and 1945 , around half of whom were killed there .
about 65,000 of the 6 million jews killed in the holocaust were austrian . foolhardy allies but after the war , the country was slow to acknowledge its embrace of nazi germany and its complicity in nazi crimes . " the austrians were given a convenient let-out as the ' first victims of hitler , " ' explained historian robert knight , a specialist in austria as a " post-nazi " society at loughborough university in england . the allies had , in 1943 , declared austria " the first victim of hitlerite aggression . "
their aim had been to encourage austrian resistance .
instead they provided the country with an excuse to live in denial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only half of the almost 200,000 people held in mauthausen survived it took decades , and both international and domestic pressure , for austria to own up to its past .
nowadays , though , the notion that austria was an accessory to nazi germany has become generally accepted . " there are still pockets of reluctance , " knight said .
" but the consensus has moved in a critical direction .
the mainstream has changed .
in some ways it is a catching-up process with west germany . " unexpected demand the interest in " nachrichten " so far indicates that austrians do want to know more about their dark past . initially published in an edition of 50,000 , albertas had to print an additional 8,000 copies of the first issue to satisfy demand .
although after six weeks it 's still too early to say whether the project is a success , the fact that austria 's two largest supermarket chains ordered it to complement their sales mix , suggests it is . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " quaero " search engine project involves 23 companies led by french technology giant thomson .
quaero , which is latin for " i search , " has n't yet got off the ground due to a lack of funding .
its estimated costs for the first five years are projected at 199 million euros , half of which france - which has championed the idea - has agreed to fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's chirac stood behind the idea for quaero the quaero project made headlines in 2005 , when france and germany proposed a search engine to take on the all-powerful , english-language based , google , which opponents felt was developing a dangerous de-facto monopoly on internet information .
following an " in-depth examination , " the european commission decided that the quaero project " brings positive externalities for the community as a whole . "
eu allows " limited " competition distortion however quaero " is not spontaneously underpinned by the market owing to divergent interests within the consortium and to uncertainties regarding the project 's chances of success , " the eu 's executive arm said in a statement .
any resultant distortions in competition " should be limited , " it added .
" we are confident that the positive contribution the program will make to european research will outweigh any distortion of competition caused by the aid , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
thomson 's targeted clients for quaero are internet network operators , content distributors and film production studios .
when developed , it will be available for personal computers , mobile phones , televisions and other platforms .
initial plan gone awry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia is also trying to compete against google the project met with criticism after it was unveiled by then-french president jacques chirac .
search engine experts cited by the financial times called the plan " a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism , " with the main critique being that by the time of quaero 's launch , the search engine market will be a generation ahead of quaero in media and device capabilities .
finally , in late 2006 some of the german developers left the project , deciding to work on a scaled-down version of their search engine , called " theseus , " named after the greek mythological figure who found his way out of the minotaur 's maze . ultimately , the french and german sides diverged over the basic concept of what a new search engine should focus on , news reports said .
the germans wanted to emphasize word-based searches , whereas the french side focused on multimedia .
china , japan also aim to compete speaking in 2006 when the split occurred , francois bourdoncle , ceo of french company exalead , said : " germany 's withdrawal reflects mainly one fact : the orientation that germany wanted for the project was not along the same lines as the one that france favored . "
the european commission last year approved a german aid scheme for theseus .

not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .

now the royals are using their art collection to take revenge . if germany will work with stolen bank secrets , we 're not so sure our art is safe there .
that 's what members of liechtenstein 's royal household must have been thinking when they decided to cancel a planned exhibition in munich . " the princely collections will abstain from making loans available to germany as long as the application of fundamental principles of the rule of law by the federal republic seems questionable as far as liechtenstein is concerned , " reads a statement from the prince 's office .
all other art loans have also been put on hold for the time being . tit for tax scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein officials feel the data theft violated their sovereignty the move comes after a massive scandal involving rich germans who have set up foundations in liechtenstein to avoid paying taxes at home .
german officials apparently paid more than four million euros -lrb- $ 6.14 million -rrb- for data on the tax culprits that had been stolen from a liechtenstein bank . the subsequent investigation has led to the downfall of one of germany 's most prominent business leaders , klaus zumwinkel , who resigned from his position as ceo of deutsche post . some 600 other germans also appear on the list of tax evaders , and many more countries , including the united states , britain and australia , have begun checking the data for the names of their own citizens . bye-bye , biedermeier at munich 's neue pinakothek museum , where some 60 paintings and 120 drawings from liechtenstein had been scheduled to go on display in an exhibition of viennese biedermeier art on may 25 , curator herbert rott was clearly disappointed by liechtenstein 's loan boycott . " needless to say it 's bitter that we 've been hit like that , " he said , according to ap news service .
rott added that he hoped the show could be restaged at a later date . according to information on the official web site of liechtenstein 's art collections , the princely treasures include major european works of art spanning five centuries . " they are among the world 's most important private collections of art today , " according to a statement on the web site . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 12.03.2008 eu allows france to bankroll google rival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking on google is a big job - and now france is trying to do it plans to build competition for search-engine google got a boost when the eu said it would help france fund competitor quaero . the eu 's competition watchdog approved 99 million euros -lrb- $ 152 million -rrb- in french state aid aimed at building a european rival to us internet search engine google .
the " quaero " search engine project involves 23 companies led by french technology giant thomson .
quaero , which is latin for " i search , " has n't yet got off the ground due to a lack of funding .
its estimated costs for the first five years are projected at 199 million euros , half of which france - which has championed the idea - has agreed to fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's chirac stood behind the idea for quaero the quaero project made headlines in 2005 , when france and germany proposed a search engine to take on the all-powerful , english-language based , google , which opponents felt was developing a dangerous de-facto monopoly on internet information .
following an " in-depth examination , " the european commission decided that the quaero project " brings positive externalities for the community as a whole . "
eu allows " limited " competition distortion however quaero " is not spontaneously underpinned by the market owing to divergent interests within the consortium and to uncertainties regarding the project 's chances of success , " the eu 's executive arm said in a statement .
any resultant distortions in competition " should be limited , " it added .
" we are confident that the positive contribution the program will make to european research will outweigh any distortion of competition caused by the aid , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
thomson 's targeted clients for quaero are internet network operators , content distributors and film production studios .
when developed , it will be available for personal computers , mobile phones , televisions and other platforms .
initial plan gone awry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia is also trying to compete against google the project met with criticism after it was unveiled by then-french president jacques chirac .
search engine experts cited by the financial times called the plan " a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism , " with the main critique being that by the time of quaero 's launch , the search engine market will be a generation ahead of quaero in media and device capabilities .
finally , in late 2006 some of the german developers left the project , deciding to work on a scaled-down version of their search engine , called " theseus , " named after the greek mythological figure who found his way out of the minotaur 's maze . ultimately , the french and german sides diverged over the basic concept of what a new search engine should focus on , news reports said .
the germans wanted to emphasize word-based searches , whereas the french side focused on multimedia .
china , japan also aim to compete speaking in 2006 when the split occurred , francois bourdoncle , ceo of french company exalead , said : " germany 's withdrawal reflects mainly one fact : the orientation that germany wanted for the project was not along the same lines as the one that france favored . "
the european commission last year approved a german aid scheme for theseus .

austrian newsstands this year are selling papers published during the time of nazi rule .
the project shows how local and foreign press saw the era . a grainy image of a procession of uniformed nazis marching somberly through the center of austria 's capital covers the front page of the daily neuigkeits-welt-blatt above the headline " the ' day of the legion ' in vienna . " " everywhere heart-felt rallies were given for the legionnaires , the self-sacrificing pioneers of the national socialist movement in german-austria , " the caption reads . the legionnaires had indeed had their day , as they could finally admit publicly to their allegiance to the previously banned nazi party without fear of reprisals .
the national socialists were fully in control and gleichschaltung , the forced coordination of austrian society , was well underway , just three weeks after nazi germany 's annexation of its neighbor , on march 12 , 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspapers are accompanied by explanatory texts the neuigkeits-welt-blatt may no longer exist , but it 's received tens of thousands of new readers due to a newspaper project running throughout 2008 , the 70th anniversary of the nazi power grab in austria .
in 52 weekly editions , " nachrichten " aims to show how the domestic and international media portrayed austria under the national socialists . eyewitness insights each edition of " nachrichten " is made up of two facsimiles of original newspapers , which are folded into an oversized cover printed with explanatory texts that provide background and context to understand the papers ' articles . the name " nachrichten " is a play on the word for " news , " nachrichten .
taken separately , nach means " after " and richten means " to judge . " but the idea is n't that people should pass judgment , said fritz hausjell , the project 's head of research and a professor of communications history at the university of vienna .
it 's meant to give people a sense of how the contemporaneous press interpreted nazi austria from both inside and outside the country . " we want to show how the media was used to facilitate this system , how the construction of reality was facilitated by the media , " hausjell said . the initiative stems from british publisher albertas ltd , which has done similar projects in denmark , finland , greece and spain , and puts out " nachrichten " in cooperation with austria 's national library and the documentation center of austrian resistance . little need for coercion one of the nazis ' first steps in consolidating power was to take control of the media , which happened overnight , as they occupied editorial offices throughout the country .
by june 1939 , journalists could only work if they were certified " aryans . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hausjell and his team choose a different topic for each issue austrians had largely welcomed hitler 's wehrmacht when it marched into the country in 1938 .
and the press could already look back on a well-developed anti-semitic tradition , hausjell pointed out . " it was striking that the austrian journalists were especially ruthless even to the point of being counterproductive , " hausjell said .
" the readiness to comply -lsb- among the press -rsb- was amazingly high . " around 125,000 austrian jews fled the country to escape the nazis .
many ended up in mauthausen , the country 's biggest concentration camp , where nearly 200,000 people were held prisoner between 1938 and 1945 , around half of whom were killed there .
about 65,000 of the 6 million jews killed in the holocaust were austrian . foolhardy allies but after the war , the country was slow to acknowledge its embrace of nazi germany and its complicity in nazi crimes . " the austrians were given a convenient let-out as the ' first victims of hitler , " ' explained historian robert knight , a specialist in austria as a " post-nazi " society at loughborough university in england . the allies had , in 1943 , declared austria " the first victim of hitlerite aggression . "
their aim had been to encourage austrian resistance .
instead they provided the country with an excuse to live in denial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only half of the almost 200,000 people held in mauthausen survived it took decades , and both international and domestic pressure , for austria to own up to its past .
nowadays , though , the notion that austria was an accessory to nazi germany has become generally accepted . " there are still pockets of reluctance , " knight said .
" but the consensus has moved in a critical direction .
the mainstream has changed .
in some ways it is a catching-up process with west germany . " unexpected demand the interest in " nachrichten " so far indicates that austrians do want to know more about their dark past . initially published in an edition of 50,000 , albertas had to print an additional 8,000 copies of the first issue to satisfy demand .
although after six weeks it 's still too early to say whether the project is a success , the fact that austria 's two largest supermarket chains ordered it to complement their sales mix , suggests it is . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

oh , just a couple of old bones it 's not unusual for customs officers to have to deal with the occasional body .
usually , the deceased turn up in coffins .
two ladies , who recently stopped at munich airport , chose another container for a dead relative . when munich officers asked the two women to open their sealed suitcase , they discovered that the travelers , both in their 60s , had placed the skull and several bones of a man inside . flying to italy via munich from brazil , the women had brought along the man 's remains to fulfill his wish of finding his final resting place in italy .
according to documents , he had already died 11 years earlier in sao paolo . while the bavarian officials were understandably surprised about the mode of transport , they did allow the women to continue their journey .
after all , they had all the necessary documents to bring the bones to naples . and who 's to say that a koffer , or suitcase in german , ca n't work just as well as a coffin ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the verdict , experts said they were mostly concerned about the victim 's behavior after the incident . a court in the western german town of muenster ruled wednesday , march 12 , that the six men had abused 163 recruits during training sessions in the summer of 2004 . five men were sentenced to suspended prison sentences of up to 22 months .
the sixth defendant was ordered to pay a fine of 7,500 euros -lrb- $ 11,500 -rrb- .
they had been charged with several crimes , including causing bodily harm , abuse and demeaning treatment . the verdict concluded the lengthy trial , which had originally begun with 18 defendants .

" it 's been a basic principle since the bundeswehr 's inception that supervisors can not touch their soldiers , let alone give them electric shocks , infuse water or do other things , " gertz said , according to ap news service . victims remain silent gertz added that this was the case even if some recruits had described simulated hostage takings as " highlights " of their military training . apparently , recruits had also been given a code word to stop the exercise at any time , but none made use of it as they feared that they would be seen as weak by their comrades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recruits should stand up for their basic rights , robbe said reinhold robbe , the german parliament 's bundeswehr commissioner , meanwhile said he had been shocked by the behavior of recruits following the abuse . in an interview with german public radio , robbe said none of the victims had filed a complaint and that the abuse only became known by coincidence . " that 's what really made me think , " robbe said , adding that young recruits should remember that they did n't renounce their basic rights as citizens when they entered the army . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

oh , just a couple of old bones it 's not unusual for customs officers to have to deal with the occasional body .
usually , the deceased turn up in coffins .
two ladies , who recently stopped at munich airport , chose another container for a dead relative . when munich officers asked the two women to open their sealed suitcase , they discovered that the travelers , both in their 60s , had placed the skull and several bones of a man inside . flying to italy via munich from brazil , the women had brought along the man 's remains to fulfill his wish of finding his final resting place in italy .
according to documents , he had already died 11 years earlier in sao paolo . while the bavarian officials were understandably surprised about the mode of transport , they did allow the women to continue their journey .
after all , they had all the necessary documents to bring the bones to naples . and who 's to say that a koffer , or suitcase in german , ca n't work just as well as a coffin ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

oh , just a couple of old bones it 's not unusual for customs officers to have to deal with the occasional body .
usually , the deceased turn up in coffins .
two ladies , who recently stopped at munich airport , chose another container for a dead relative . when munich officers asked the two women to open their sealed suitcase , they discovered that the travelers , both in their 60s , had placed the skull and several bones of a man inside . flying to italy via munich from brazil , the women had brought along the man 's remains to fulfill his wish of finding his final resting place in italy .
according to documents , he had already died 11 years earlier in sao paolo . while the bavarian officials were understandably surprised about the mode of transport , they did allow the women to continue their journey .
after all , they had all the necessary documents to bring the bones to naples . and who 's to say that a koffer , or suitcase in german , ca n't work just as well as a coffin ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the verdict , experts said they were mostly concerned about the victim 's behavior after the incident . a court in the western german town of muenster ruled wednesday , march 12 , that the six men had abused 163 recruits during training sessions in the summer of 2004 . five men were sentenced to suspended prison sentences of up to 22 months .
the sixth defendant was ordered to pay a fine of 7,500 euros -lrb- $ 11,500 -rrb- .
they had been charged with several crimes , including causing bodily harm , abuse and demeaning treatment . the verdict concluded the lengthy trial , which had originally begun with 18 defendants .
three other men had already been given suspended prison sentence and fines at an earlier date .
the charges against the other defendants were dropped . a need for soul-searching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials will have to rethink training practices across the armed forces military experts meanwhile cautioned that while the trial had ended , germany 's bundeswehr still had work to do . bernhard gertz , the head of the federal armed forces association , which represents soldiers , said that disciplinary investigations into the case now had to find out if supervisors had violated their duties by not respecting the dignity of other human beings . " it 's been a basic principle since the bundeswehr 's inception that supervisors can not touch their soldiers , let alone give them electric shocks , infuse water or do other things , " gertz said , according to ap news service . victims remain silent gertz added that this was the case even if some recruits had described simulated hostage takings as " highlights " of their military training . apparently , recruits had also been given a code word to stop the exercise at any time , but none made use of it as they feared that they would be seen as weak by their comrades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recruits should stand up for their basic rights , robbe said reinhold robbe , the german parliament 's bundeswehr commissioner , meanwhile said he had been shocked by the behavior of recruits following the abuse . in an interview with german public radio , robbe said none of the victims had filed a complaint and that the abuse only became known by coincidence . " that 's what really made me think , " robbe said , adding that young recruits should remember that they did n't renounce their basic rights as citizens when they entered the army . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" needless to say it 's bitter that we 've been hit like that , " he said , according to ap news service .
rott added that he hoped the show could be restaged at a later date . according to information on the official web site of liechtenstein 's art collections , the princely treasures include major european works of art spanning five centuries .

a growing number of side deals are undercutting the bloc 's efforts to negotiate a collective policy . estonia and latvia want their citizens to be able to travel to the united states without having to apply for a visa first .
the " visa waiver " program is a comfort citizens from 15 european countries , including germany , have enjoyed for years .
but as the eu has grown , the us has been reluctant to extend the same welcome to new members , forcing many eu citizens to apply for visas even for short business trips or holidays to the us . the pair of baltic countries signed separate bilateral agreements with the us on wednesday , march 12 , which start both countries down the road to easy trans-atlantic travel .
the czech republic already has a similar agreement with the us , and lithuania , slovakia and hungary hoped to sign deals " as soon as possible , " a lithuanian diplomat said wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not always easy to get a visa but the deals could erode the eu 's attempt to negotiate easier travel for all of its 27 member states .
the european commission warned member states against separate negotiations , saying that this would undercut the eu 's collective bargaining power .
the eu is also worried that countries will agree to give the us too much personal data about airline passengers , which us authorities say is needed for security reasons . estonia , latvia not willing to wait but estonia and latvia said they decided to sign bilateral deals rather than wait out lengthy negotiations between brussels and washington . " why should our citizens wait for some unique agreement involving all member states ?
the free movement of our citizens is one of the interests of our country , " latvian foreign minister maris riekstins said . the visa regulations have been a sore point for those not in the " visa waiver " program , most of them ex-communist countries which have become vocal us supporters since breaking away from moscow 's sphere of influence at the end of the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu countries do n't want to wait estonia and latvia left the soviet union in 1991 and joined the eu and nato in 2004 .
they have supplied troops for the us-led military campaigns in iraq and afghanistan . us entry rules are linked to american concerns that citizens from poor countries will use tourist visas to immigrate illegally to the us .
but estonia and latvia have shown they 're worthy of a waiver , us homeland security secretary michael chertoff told reporters . " this is a milestone occasion , a major step forward , " he added . eu wants to take the lead the european commission began its own visa-free travel negotiations with the us on wednesday .
european commission vice president franco frattini urged member states to stop separate visa negotiations with the us , which he called an area " of european responsibility . " " i would expect on the basis of a common approach that european union member states stop negotiating with the united states in eu fields " of jurisdiction , he told reporters . speaking on the sidelines of an eu ministerial conference in slovenia , frattini said the eu ambassadors of the 27 member states had unanimously agreed on a common approach to the exploratory talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german passport like this will get you into the us the issue is expected to top the agenda of thursday 's eu-us justice meeting with michael chertoff in slovenia , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
us officials said they would continue making bilateral deals with eu members . " we have arrangements that we are working out with individual member states , and i would expect that that is going to continue absent some sort of agreement within the eu to the contrary , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack said .
" if the eu has some dispute internal to the eu , then the eu needs to work that out .

now the royals are using their art collection to take revenge . if germany will work with stolen bank secrets , we 're not so sure our art is safe there .
that 's what members of liechtenstein 's royal household must have been thinking when they decided to cancel a planned exhibition in munich . " the princely collections will abstain from making loans available to germany as long as the application of fundamental principles of the rule of law by the federal republic seems questionable as far as liechtenstein is concerned , " reads a statement from the prince 's office .
all other art loans have also been put on hold for the time being . tit for tax scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein officials feel the data theft violated their sovereignty the move comes after a massive scandal involving rich germans who have set up foundations in liechtenstein to avoid paying taxes at home .
german officials apparently paid more than four million euros -lrb- $ 6.14 million -rrb- for data on the tax culprits that had been stolen from a liechtenstein bank . the subsequent investigation has led to the downfall of one of germany 's most prominent business leaders , klaus zumwinkel , who resigned from his position as ceo of deutsche post . some 600 other germans also appear on the list of tax evaders , and many more countries , including the united states , britain and australia , have begun checking the data for the names of their own citizens . bye-bye , biedermeier at munich 's neue pinakothek museum , where some 60 paintings and 120 drawings from liechtenstein had been scheduled to go on display in an exhibition of viennese biedermeier art on may 25 , curator herbert rott was clearly disappointed by liechtenstein 's loan boycott . " needless to say it 's bitter that we 've been hit like that , " he said , according to ap news service .
rott added that he hoped the show could be restaged at a later date . according to information on the official web site of liechtenstein 's art collections , the princely treasures include major european works of art spanning five centuries . " they are among the world 's most important private collections of art today , " according to a statement on the web site . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " quaero " search engine project involves 23 companies led by french technology giant thomson .
quaero , which is latin for " i search , " has n't yet got off the ground due to a lack of funding .
its estimated costs for the first five years are projected at 199 million euros , half of which france - which has championed the idea - has agreed to fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's chirac stood behind the idea for quaero the quaero project made headlines in 2005 , when france and germany proposed a search engine to take on the all-powerful , english-language based , google , which opponents felt was developing a dangerous de-facto monopoly on internet information .
following an " in-depth examination , " the european commission decided that the quaero project " brings positive externalities for the community as a whole . "
eu allows " limited " competition distortion however quaero " is not spontaneously underpinned by the market owing to divergent interests within the consortium and to uncertainties regarding the project 's chances of success , " the eu 's executive arm said in a statement .
any resultant distortions in competition " should be limited , " it added .
" we are confident that the positive contribution the program will make to european research will outweigh any distortion of competition caused by the aid , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
thomson 's targeted clients for quaero are internet network operators , content distributors and film production studios .
when developed , it will be available for personal computers , mobile phones , televisions and other platforms .
initial plan gone awry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia is also trying to compete against google the project met with criticism after it was unveiled by then-french president jacques chirac .
search engine experts cited by the financial times called the plan " a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism , " with the main critique being that by the time of quaero 's launch , the search engine market will be a generation ahead of quaero in media and device capabilities .
finally , in late 2006 some of the german developers left the project , deciding to work on a scaled-down version of their search engine , called " theseus , " named after the greek mythological figure who found his way out of the minotaur 's maze . ultimately , the french and german sides diverged over the basic concept of what a new search engine should focus on , news reports said .
the germans wanted to emphasize word-based searches , whereas the french side focused on multimedia .
china , japan also aim to compete speaking in 2006 when the split occurred , francois bourdoncle , ceo of french company exalead , said : " germany 's withdrawal reflects mainly one fact : the orientation that germany wanted for the project was not along the same lines as the one that france favored .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 12.03.2008 europe struggles to end us visa restrictions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us are having difficulty getting the winds of travel blowing in the same direction visa-free travel to the united states remains one area in which not all eu countries are treated equally .
a growing number of side deals are undercutting the bloc 's efforts to negotiate a collective policy . estonia and latvia want their citizens to be able to travel to the united states without having to apply for a visa first .
the " visa waiver " program is a comfort citizens from 15 european countries , including germany , have enjoyed for years .
but as the eu has grown , the us has been reluctant to extend the same welcome to new members , forcing many eu citizens to apply for visas even for short business trips or holidays to the us . the pair of baltic countries signed separate bilateral agreements with the us on wednesday , march 12 , which start both countries down the road to easy trans-atlantic travel .
the czech republic already has a similar agreement with the us , and lithuania , slovakia and hungary hoped to sign deals " as soon as possible , " a lithuanian diplomat said wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not always easy to get a visa but the deals could erode the eu 's attempt to negotiate easier travel for all of its 27 member states .
the european commission warned member states against separate negotiations , saying that this would undercut the eu 's collective bargaining power .
the eu is also worried that countries will agree to give the us too much personal data about airline passengers , which us authorities say is needed for security reasons . estonia , latvia not willing to wait but estonia and latvia said they decided to sign bilateral deals rather than wait out lengthy negotiations between brussels and washington . " why should our citizens wait for some unique agreement involving all member states ?
the free movement of our citizens is one of the interests of our country , " latvian foreign minister maris riekstins said . the visa regulations have been a sore point for those not in the " visa waiver " program , most of them ex-communist countries which have become vocal us supporters since breaking away from moscow 's sphere of influence at the end of the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu countries do n't want to wait estonia and latvia left the soviet union in 1991 and joined the eu and nato in 2004 .
they have supplied troops for the us-led military campaigns in iraq and afghanistan . us entry rules are linked to american concerns that citizens from poor countries will use tourist visas to immigrate illegally to the us .
but estonia and latvia have shown they 're worthy of a waiver , us homeland security secretary michael chertoff told reporters . " this is a milestone occasion , a major step forward , " he added . eu wants to take the lead the european commission began its own visa-free travel negotiations with the us on wednesday .
european commission vice president franco frattini urged member states to stop separate visa negotiations with the us , which he called an area " of european responsibility . " " i would expect on the basis of a common approach that european union member states stop negotiating with the united states in eu fields " of jurisdiction , he told reporters . speaking on the sidelines of an eu ministerial conference in slovenia , frattini said the eu ambassadors of the 27 member states had unanimously agreed on a common approach to the exploratory talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german passport like this will get you into the us the issue is expected to top the agenda of thursday 's eu-us justice meeting with michael chertoff in slovenia , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
us officials said they would continue making bilateral deals with eu members . " we have arrangements that we are working out with individual member states , and i would expect that that is going to continue absent some sort of agreement within the eu to the contrary , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack said .
" if the eu has some dispute internal to the eu , then the eu needs to work that out . " speaking at the end of the ministerial conference at brdo castle , frattini said wednesday that the travel memorandums signed latvia and estonia " should not be considered as operational documents , rather as political ones . " " no member state will be implementing political memorandums -lsb- bilaterally signed with the us -rsb- on areas that are under eu responsibility , " frattini told reporters , before admitting he could do little to stop them from doing so . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

oh , just a couple of old bones it 's not unusual for customs officers to have to deal with the occasional body .
usually , the deceased turn up in coffins .
two ladies , who recently stopped at munich airport , chose another container for a dead relative . when munich officers asked the two women to open their sealed suitcase , they discovered that the travelers , both in their 60s , had placed the skull and several bones of a man inside . flying to italy via munich from brazil , the women had brought along the man 's remains to fulfill his wish of finding his final resting place in italy .
according to documents , he had already died 11 years earlier in sao paolo . while the bavarian officials were understandably surprised about the mode of transport , they did allow the women to continue their journey .

the " quaero " search engine project involves 23 companies led by french technology giant thomson .
quaero , which is latin for " i search , " has n't yet got off the ground due to a lack of funding .
its estimated costs for the first five years are projected at 199 million euros , half of which france - which has championed the idea - has agreed to fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's chirac stood behind the idea for quaero the quaero project made headlines in 2005 , when france and germany proposed a search engine to take on the all-powerful , english-language based , google , which opponents felt was developing a dangerous de-facto monopoly on internet information .
following an " in-depth examination , " the european commission decided that the quaero project " brings positive externalities for the community as a whole . "
eu allows " limited " competition distortion however quaero " is not spontaneously underpinned by the market owing to divergent interests within the consortium and to uncertainties regarding the project 's chances of success , " the eu 's executive arm said in a statement .
any resultant distortions in competition " should be limited , " it added .
" we are confident that the positive contribution the program will make to european research will outweigh any distortion of competition caused by the aid , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
thomson 's targeted clients for quaero are internet network operators , content distributors and film production studios .
when developed , it will be available for personal computers , mobile phones , televisions and other platforms .
initial plan gone awry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia is also trying to compete against google the project met with criticism after it was unveiled by then-french president jacques chirac .
search engine experts cited by the financial times called the plan " a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism , " with the main critique being that by the time of quaero 's launch , the search engine market will be a generation ahead of quaero in media and device capabilities .
finally , in late 2006 some of the german developers left the project , deciding to work on a scaled-down version of their search engine , called " theseus , " named after the greek mythological figure who found his way out of the minotaur 's maze . ultimately , the french and german sides diverged over the basic concept of what a new search engine should focus on , news reports said .
the germans wanted to emphasize word-based searches , whereas the french side focused on multimedia .
china , japan also aim to compete speaking in 2006 when the split occurred , francois bourdoncle , ceo of french company exalead , said : " germany 's withdrawal reflects mainly one fact : the orientation that germany wanted for the project was not along the same lines as the one that france favored .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .

oh , just a couple of old bones it 's not unusual for customs officers to have to deal with the occasional body .
usually , the deceased turn up in coffins .
two ladies , who recently stopped at munich airport , chose another container for a dead relative . when munich officers asked the two women to open their sealed suitcase , they discovered that the travelers , both in their 60s , had placed the skull and several bones of a man inside . flying to italy via munich from brazil , the women had brought along the man 's remains to fulfill his wish of finding his final resting place in italy .
according to documents , he had already died 11 years earlier in sao paolo . while the bavarian officials were understandably surprised about the mode of transport , they did allow the women to continue their journey .
after all , they had all the necessary documents to bring the bones to naples . and who 's to say that a koffer , or suitcase in german , ca n't work just as well as a coffin ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austrian newsstands this year are selling papers published during the time of nazi rule .
the project shows how local and foreign press saw the era . a grainy image of a procession of uniformed nazis marching somberly through the center of austria 's capital covers the front page of the daily neuigkeits-welt-blatt above the headline " the ' day of the legion ' in vienna . " " everywhere heart-felt rallies were given for the legionnaires , the self-sacrificing pioneers of the national socialist movement in german-austria , " the caption reads . the legionnaires had indeed had their day , as they could finally admit publicly to their allegiance to the previously banned nazi party without fear of reprisals .
the national socialists were fully in control and gleichschaltung , the forced coordination of austrian society , was well underway , just three weeks after nazi germany 's annexation of its neighbor , on march 12 , 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspapers are accompanied by explanatory texts the neuigkeits-welt-blatt may no longer exist , but it 's received tens of thousands of new readers due to a newspaper project running throughout 2008 , the 70th anniversary of the nazi power grab in austria .
in 52 weekly editions , " nachrichten " aims to show how the domestic and international media portrayed austria under the national socialists . eyewitness insights each edition of " nachrichten " is made up of two facsimiles of original newspapers , which are folded into an oversized cover printed with explanatory texts that provide background and context to understand the papers ' articles . the name " nachrichten " is a play on the word for " news , " nachrichten .
taken separately , nach means " after " and richten means " to judge . " but the idea is n't that people should pass judgment , said fritz hausjell , the project 's head of research and a professor of communications history at the university of vienna .
it 's meant to give people a sense of how the contemporaneous press interpreted nazi austria from both inside and outside the country . " we want to show how the media was used to facilitate this system , how the construction of reality was facilitated by the media , " hausjell said . the initiative stems from british publisher albertas ltd , which has done similar projects in denmark , finland , greece and spain , and puts out " nachrichten " in cooperation with austria 's national library and the documentation center of austrian resistance . little need for coercion one of the nazis ' first steps in consolidating power was to take control of the media , which happened overnight , as they occupied editorial offices throughout the country .
by june 1939 , journalists could only work if they were certified " aryans . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hausjell and his team choose a different topic for each issue austrians had largely welcomed hitler 's wehrmacht when it marched into the country in 1938 .
and the press could already look back on a well-developed anti-semitic tradition , hausjell pointed out . " it was striking that the austrian journalists were especially ruthless even to the point of being counterproductive , " hausjell said .
" the readiness to comply -lsb- among the press -rsb- was amazingly high . " around 125,000 austrian jews fled the country to escape the nazis .
many ended up in mauthausen , the country 's biggest concentration camp , where nearly 200,000 people were held prisoner between 1938 and 1945 , around half of whom were killed there .
about 65,000 of the 6 million jews killed in the holocaust were austrian . foolhardy allies but after the war , the country was slow to acknowledge its embrace of nazi germany and its complicity in nazi crimes . " the austrians were given a convenient let-out as the ' first victims of hitler , " ' explained historian robert knight , a specialist in austria as a " post-nazi " society at loughborough university in england . the allies had , in 1943 , declared austria " the first victim of hitlerite aggression . "
their aim had been to encourage austrian resistance .
instead they provided the country with an excuse to live in denial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only half of the almost 200,000 people held in mauthausen survived it took decades , and both international and domestic pressure , for austria to own up to its past .
nowadays , though , the notion that austria was an accessory to nazi germany has become generally accepted . " there are still pockets of reluctance , " knight said .
" but the consensus has moved in a critical direction .
the mainstream has changed .
in some ways it is a catching-up process with west germany . " unexpected demand the interest in " nachrichten " so far indicates that austrians do want to know more about their dark past . initially published in an edition of 50,000 , albertas had to print an additional 8,000 copies of the first issue to satisfy demand .
although after six weeks it 's still too early to say whether the project is a success , the fact that austria 's two largest supermarket chains ordered it to complement their sales mix , suggests it is . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 hitler 's austria through the eyes of the press großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrians , here in vienna , welcomed hitler 's assumption of power on march 12 , 1938 , hitler 's native austria was annexed by germany .
austrian newsstands this year are selling papers published during the time of nazi rule .
the project shows how local and foreign press saw the era . a grainy image of a procession of uniformed nazis marching somberly through the center of austria 's capital covers the front page of the daily neuigkeits-welt-blatt above the headline " the ' day of the legion ' in vienna . " " everywhere heart-felt rallies were given for the legionnaires , the self-sacrificing pioneers of the national socialist movement in german-austria , " the caption reads . the legionnaires had indeed had their day , as they could finally admit publicly to their allegiance to the previously banned nazi party without fear of reprisals .
the national socialists were fully in control and gleichschaltung , the forced coordination of austrian society , was well underway , just three weeks after nazi germany 's annexation of its neighbor , on march 12 , 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspapers are accompanied by explanatory texts the neuigkeits-welt-blatt may no longer exist , but it 's received tens of thousands of new readers due to a newspaper project running throughout 2008 , the 70th anniversary of the nazi power grab in austria .
in 52 weekly editions , " nachrichten " aims to show how the domestic and international media portrayed austria under the national socialists . eyewitness insights each edition of " nachrichten " is made up of two facsimiles of original newspapers , which are folded into an oversized cover printed with explanatory texts that provide background and context to understand the papers ' articles . the name " nachrichten " is a play on the word for " news , " nachrichten .
taken separately , nach means " after " and richten means " to judge . " but the idea is n't that people should pass judgment , said fritz hausjell , the project 's head of research and a professor of communications history at the university of vienna .
it 's meant to give people a sense of how the contemporaneous press interpreted nazi austria from both inside and outside the country . " we want to show how the media was used to facilitate this system , how the construction of reality was facilitated by the media , " hausjell said . the initiative stems from british publisher albertas ltd , which has done similar projects in denmark , finland , greece and spain , and puts out " nachrichten " in cooperation with austria 's national library and the documentation center of austrian resistance . little need for coercion one of the nazis ' first steps in consolidating power was to take control of the media , which happened overnight , as they occupied editorial offices throughout the country .
by june 1939 , journalists could only work if they were certified " aryans . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hausjell and his team choose a different topic for each issue austrians had largely welcomed hitler 's wehrmacht when it marched into the country in 1938 .
and the press could already look back on a well-developed anti-semitic tradition , hausjell pointed out . " it was striking that the austrian journalists were especially ruthless even to the point of being counterproductive , " hausjell said .
" the readiness to comply -lsb- among the press -rsb- was amazingly high . " around 125,000 austrian jews fled the country to escape the nazis .
many ended up in mauthausen , the country 's biggest concentration camp , where nearly 200,000 people were held prisoner between 1938 and 1945 , around half of whom were killed there .
about 65,000 of the 6 million jews killed in the holocaust were austrian . foolhardy allies but after the war , the country was slow to acknowledge its embrace of nazi germany and its complicity in nazi crimes . " the austrians were given a convenient let-out as the ' first victims of hitler , " ' explained historian robert knight , a specialist in austria as a " post-nazi " society at loughborough university in england . the allies had , in 1943 , declared austria " the first victim of hitlerite aggression . "
their aim had been to encourage austrian resistance .
instead they provided the country with an excuse to live in denial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only half of the almost 200,000 people held in mauthausen survived it took decades , and both international and domestic pressure , for austria to own up to its past .

that 's what members of liechtenstein 's royal household must have been thinking when they decided to cancel a planned exhibition in munich .

" needless to say it 's bitter that we 've been hit like that , " he said , according to ap news service .
rott added that he hoped the show could be restaged at a later date . according to information on the official web site of liechtenstein 's art collections , the princely treasures include major european works of art spanning five centuries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

oh , just a couple of old bones it 's not unusual for customs officers to have to deal with the occasional body .
usually , the deceased turn up in coffins .
two ladies , who recently stopped at munich airport , chose another container for a dead relative . when munich officers asked the two women to open their sealed suitcase , they discovered that the travelers , both in their 60s , had placed the skull and several bones of a man inside . flying to italy via munich from brazil , the women had brought along the man 's remains to fulfill his wish of finding his final resting place in italy .
according to documents , he had already died 11 years earlier in sao paolo . while the bavarian officials were understandably surprised about the mode of transport , they did allow the women to continue their journey .
after all , they had all the necessary documents to bring the bones to naples . and who 's to say that a koffer , or suitcase in german , ca n't work just as well as a coffin ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austrian newsstands this year are selling papers published during the time of nazi rule .
the project shows how local and foreign press saw the era . a grainy image of a procession of uniformed nazis marching somberly through the center of austria 's capital covers the front page of the daily neuigkeits-welt-blatt above the headline " the ' day of the legion ' in vienna . " " everywhere heart-felt rallies were given for the legionnaires , the self-sacrificing pioneers of the national socialist movement in german-austria , " the caption reads . the legionnaires had indeed had their day , as they could finally admit publicly to their allegiance to the previously banned nazi party without fear of reprisals .
the national socialists were fully in control and gleichschaltung , the forced coordination of austrian society , was well underway , just three weeks after nazi germany 's annexation of its neighbor , on march 12 , 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspapers are accompanied by explanatory texts the neuigkeits-welt-blatt may no longer exist , but it 's received tens of thousands of new readers due to a newspaper project running throughout 2008 , the 70th anniversary of the nazi power grab in austria .
in 52 weekly editions , " nachrichten " aims to show how the domestic and international media portrayed austria under the national socialists . eyewitness insights each edition of " nachrichten " is made up of two facsimiles of original newspapers , which are folded into an oversized cover printed with explanatory texts that provide background and context to understand the papers ' articles . the name " nachrichten " is a play on the word for " news , " nachrichten .

" we want to show how the media was used to facilitate this system , how the construction of reality was facilitated by the media , " hausjell said . the initiative stems from british publisher albertas ltd , which has done similar projects in denmark , finland , greece and spain , and puts out " nachrichten " in cooperation with austria 's national library and the documentation center of austrian resistance . little need for coercion one of the nazis ' first steps in consolidating power was to take control of the media , which happened overnight , as they occupied editorial offices throughout the country .

about 65,000 of the 6 million jews killed in the holocaust were austrian . foolhardy allies but after the war , the country was slow to acknowledge its embrace of nazi germany and its complicity in nazi crimes . " the austrians were given a convenient let-out as the ' first victims of hitler , " ' explained historian robert knight , a specialist in austria as a " post-nazi " society at loughborough university in england . the allies had , in 1943 , declared austria " the first victim of hitlerite aggression .

oh , just a couple of old bones it 's not unusual for customs officers to have to deal with the occasional body .
usually , the deceased turn up in coffins .
two ladies , who recently stopped at munich airport , chose another container for a dead relative . when munich officers asked the two women to open their sealed suitcase , they discovered that the travelers , both in their 60s , had placed the skull and several bones of a man inside . flying to italy via munich from brazil , the women had brought along the man 's remains to fulfill his wish of finding his final resting place in italy .
according to documents , he had already died 11 years earlier in sao paolo . while the bavarian officials were understandably surprised about the mode of transport , they did allow the women to continue their journey .
after all , they had all the necessary documents to bring the bones to naples . and who 's to say that a koffer , or suitcase in german , ca n't work just as well as a coffin ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a growing number of side deals are undercutting the bloc 's efforts to negotiate a collective policy . estonia and latvia want their citizens to be able to travel to the united states without having to apply for a visa first .
the " visa waiver " program is a comfort citizens from 15 european countries , including germany , have enjoyed for years .
but as the eu has grown , the us has been reluctant to extend the same welcome to new members , forcing many eu citizens to apply for visas even for short business trips or holidays to the us . the pair of baltic countries signed separate bilateral agreements with the us on wednesday , march 12 , which start both countries down the road to easy trans-atlantic travel .

a growing number of side deals are undercutting the bloc 's efforts to negotiate a collective policy . estonia and latvia want their citizens to be able to travel to the united states without having to apply for a visa first .
the " visa waiver " program is a comfort citizens from 15 european countries , including germany , have enjoyed for years .
but as the eu has grown , the us has been reluctant to extend the same welcome to new members , forcing many eu citizens to apply for visas even for short business trips or holidays to the us . the pair of baltic countries signed separate bilateral agreements with the us on wednesday , march 12 , which start both countries down the road to easy trans-atlantic travel .
the czech republic already has a similar agreement with the us , and lithuania , slovakia and hungary hoped to sign deals " as soon as possible , " a lithuanian diplomat said wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not always easy to get a visa but the deals could erode the eu 's attempt to negotiate easier travel for all of its 27 member states .
the european commission warned member states against separate negotiations , saying that this would undercut the eu 's collective bargaining power .
the eu is also worried that countries will agree to give the us too much personal data about airline passengers , which us authorities say is needed for security reasons . estonia , latvia not willing to wait but estonia and latvia said they decided to sign bilateral deals rather than wait out lengthy negotiations between brussels and washington . " why should our citizens wait for some unique agreement involving all member states ?
the free movement of our citizens is one of the interests of our country , " latvian foreign minister maris riekstins said . the visa regulations have been a sore point for those not in the " visa waiver " program , most of them ex-communist countries which have become vocal us supporters since breaking away from moscow 's sphere of influence at the end of the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu countries do n't want to wait estonia and latvia left the soviet union in 1991 and joined the eu and nato in 2004 .
they have supplied troops for the us-led military campaigns in iraq and afghanistan . us entry rules are linked to american concerns that citizens from poor countries will use tourist visas to immigrate illegally to the us .
but estonia and latvia have shown they 're worthy of a waiver , us homeland security secretary michael chertoff told reporters . " this is a milestone occasion , a major step forward , " he added . eu wants to take the lead the european commission began its own visa-free travel negotiations with the us on wednesday .
european commission vice president franco frattini urged member states to stop separate visa negotiations with the us , which he called an area " of european responsibility . " " i would expect on the basis of a common approach that european union member states stop negotiating with the united states in eu fields " of jurisdiction , he told reporters . speaking on the sidelines of an eu ministerial conference in slovenia , frattini said the eu ambassadors of the 27 member states had unanimously agreed on a common approach to the exploratory talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german passport like this will get you into the us the issue is expected to top the agenda of thursday 's eu-us justice meeting with michael chertoff in slovenia , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
us officials said they would continue making bilateral deals with eu members . " we have arrangements that we are working out with individual member states , and i would expect that that is going to continue absent some sort of agreement within the eu to the contrary , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack said .
" if the eu has some dispute internal to the eu , then the eu needs to work that out . " speaking at the end of the ministerial conference at brdo castle , frattini said wednesday that the travel memorandums signed latvia and estonia " should not be considered as operational documents , rather as political ones . " " no member state will be implementing political memorandums -lsb- bilaterally signed with the us -rsb- on areas that are under eu responsibility , " frattini told reporters , before admitting he could do little to stop them from doing so . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the royals are using their art collection to take revenge . if germany will work with stolen bank secrets , we 're not so sure our art is safe there .
that 's what members of liechtenstein 's royal household must have been thinking when they decided to cancel a planned exhibition in munich . " the princely collections will abstain from making loans available to germany as long as the application of fundamental principles of the rule of law by the federal republic seems questionable as far as liechtenstein is concerned , " reads a statement from the prince 's office .
all other art loans have also been put on hold for the time being . tit for tax scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein officials feel the data theft violated their sovereignty the move comes after a massive scandal involving rich germans who have set up foundations in liechtenstein to avoid paying taxes at home .
german officials apparently paid more than four million euros -lrb- $ 6.14 million -rrb- for data on the tax culprits that had been stolen from a liechtenstein bank . the subsequent investigation has led to the downfall of one of germany 's most prominent business leaders , klaus zumwinkel , who resigned from his position as ceo of deutsche post . some 600 other germans also appear on the list of tax evaders , and many more countries , including the united states , britain and australia , have begun checking the data for the names of their own citizens . bye-bye , biedermeier at munich 's neue pinakothek museum , where some 60 paintings and 120 drawings from liechtenstein had been scheduled to go on display in an exhibition of viennese biedermeier art on may 25 , curator herbert rott was clearly disappointed by liechtenstein 's loan boycott . " needless to say it 's bitter that we 've been hit like that , " he said , according to ap news service .
rott added that he hoped the show could be restaged at a later date . according to information on the official web site of liechtenstein 's art collections , the princely treasures include major european works of art spanning five centuries .

the " quaero " search engine project involves 23 companies led by french technology giant thomson .
quaero , which is latin for " i search , " has n't yet got off the ground due to a lack of funding .
its estimated costs for the first five years are projected at 199 million euros , half of which france - which has championed the idea - has agreed to fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's chirac stood behind the idea for quaero the quaero project made headlines in 2005 , when france and germany proposed a search engine to take on the all-powerful , english-language based , google , which opponents felt was developing a dangerous de-facto monopoly on internet information .
following an " in-depth examination , " the european commission decided that the quaero project " brings positive externalities for the community as a whole . "
eu allows " limited " competition distortion however quaero " is not spontaneously underpinned by the market owing to divergent interests within the consortium and to uncertainties regarding the project 's chances of success , " the eu 's executive arm said in a statement .
any resultant distortions in competition " should be limited , " it added .
" we are confident that the positive contribution the program will make to european research will outweigh any distortion of competition caused by the aid , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
thomson 's targeted clients for quaero are internet network operators , content distributors and film production studios .
when developed , it will be available for personal computers , mobile phones , televisions and other platforms .

search engine experts cited by the financial times called the plan " a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism , " with the main critique being that by the time of quaero 's launch , the search engine market will be a generation ahead of quaero in media and device capabilities .
finally , in late 2006 some of the german developers left the project , deciding to work on a scaled-down version of their search engine , called " theseus , " named after the greek mythological figure who found his way out of the minotaur 's maze . ultimately , the french and german sides diverged over the basic concept of what a new search engine should focus on , news reports said .
the germans wanted to emphasize word-based searches , whereas the french side focused on multimedia .
china , japan also aim to compete speaking in 2006 when the split occurred , francois bourdoncle , ceo of french company exalead , said : " germany 's withdrawal reflects mainly one fact : the orientation that germany wanted for the project was not along the same lines as the one that france favored .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 12.03.2008 court ruling stretches the limits of independent media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political parties can have a share in private broadcasters , but no influence , the court said germany 's highest court has ruled a law banning political parties from own shares in private broadcasting companies unconstitutional .
the decision is atypical but no reason for alarm , said media expert jo groebel . the ruling , which germany 's federal constitutional court announced on wednesday , march 12 , allows for minimal involvement by political parties in private radio broadcasters , as long as the party has no control over programming . at the same time , the court forbade " any political instrumentalization of broadcasters . " the decision applies to a 2000 hesse state law that banned political party ownership in private media .
premier roland koch , a member of the christian democratic union , said the law was intended to prevent a single party from gaining the political upper hand by influencing the media . germany 's social democratic party , whose party-run publishing company ddvg had owned a 2.3 percent share in the private radio broadcaster ffh , appealed the law , taking the case to the constitutional court . the spd is the only political party in germany to maintain ownership in media organizations and has done so since the early 1970s .
companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

companies sponsored by the parties have between a 0.5 percent and 11 percent share in 12 private broadcasters in six german states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groebel said germany should be wary of any more political involvement in media baden-wuerttemberg , schleswig-holstein and thuringia , which have banned the involvement of political parties in private media , will have to review their laws .
bavaria , the largest state , in 2005 allowed for minimal participation only if the party was restricted from voting as a shareholder . dw-world.de spoke with media expert jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute in berlin , about the court decision and the influence of politics on germany 's media landscape . dw-world.de : are you surprised at the constitutional court 's decision to allow political parties in hesse to maintain minimal ownership in private broadcasters ? jo groebel : i 'm slightly surprised because , in germany in particular , there 's always been the tendency to make a very strict distinction between political interests and parties on the one hand and public media in general .
germany has a past of very tricky interference by politics - whether by government or parties - in media and that has always steered and determined germany 's -lsb- media -rsb- policies . germany has public broadcasters that are funded by the government and its highest court has just decided political parties could have ownership in private broadcasters .
in this context , how does germany define freedom of the press ? there has always been a distinction between public broadcasting on the one hand and private media on the other .
with public broadcasting , there is most definitely a certain influence not by the government but by political parties , even if it 's only indirect .
this mirrors , to a certain extent , the german system of representative democracy . public broadcasting commissions have influence on the election of chair people and even programming decisions .
these commissions are also characterized by a large portion of party participation - directly and indirectly via churches , unions , and other groups -lsb- which also have representation in the commissions -rsb- .
but this can be perceived as mirroring democracy as it is represented by the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are political parties deciding who is behind the microphone ?
with private media , it is a completely different issue .
we 've got a dual system , which means that private media is basically free of political influence and only impacted by market developments . in the past there have been major discussions about this , more related to the press than to broadcasting .
the social democrats , for example , have a -lsb- 40 percent -rsb- share in the frankfurter rundschau , which is a mid-leftwing newspaper , and there has been some concern that there could be an influence on editorial policy . the spd 's ownership in the hessian broadcaster ffh was very small at 2.3 percent .
with such a minimal stake , did they have any influence at all ? the social democrats , or any other party , are not a commercial entity .
one could ask why they 're interested in having any share .
my assumption - and that 's why i was slightly surprised by the court 's decision - is that there must be some kind of indirect influence .
though with such a small share , they mostly likely can not influence decisions .
ffh is not a station that focuses on political topics .
still , it 's a very successful , large radio station and one could assume that influence is still possible , even with such a minority share . however , i do n't think it 's a dramatic situation . what 's the situation in other european countries as far as political involvement in media goes ? it 's very different .
let 's look at one dramatic situation , in italy when berlusconi was prime minister - and he may be back in office again very soon .
not only was he the biggest private media owner in italy , but , through his office , he had a very strong influence on public broadcasting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling only applies to private radio broadcasters the dangers that this situation poses to democracy are clearly represented by what we saw in italy in the past couple of years and may face again if berlusconi returns to office . do you think that the court decision will impact the media laws in other german states ? i do n't think it will have a major impact .
in this case , i 'd like to believe in the good in people and not assume that this is a signal for political parties in other german states to try something similar . when -lsb- oskar -rsb- lafontaine - who is now one of the leaders of the new left party , which is creating hell for the social democrats - belonged to the spd and was state premier in saarland , he immediately tried to influence the saarbruecker zeitung .
the paper did n't report the way he wanted , and he tried to introduce media laws that would have allowed him to prohibit critical reporting . there very often seems to be a temptation for politicians , political parties and governments - even in democratic states - to influence the press or at least have some impact on it .
i think that , due to its past , the germans are particularly sensitive to any interference between media on the one hand and parties and politics on the other .
for example , the hugenberg media company is said to have prepared the nazi regime via a monopoly of the press . i suppose that this court decision is not a dramatic situation , but we should always be alert to prevent any tendencies that go beyond today 's decision . disclaimer : deutsche welle is a publically funded media organization . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the royals are using their art collection to take revenge . if germany will work with stolen bank secrets , we 're not so sure our art is safe there .
that 's what members of liechtenstein 's royal household must have been thinking when they decided to cancel a planned exhibition in munich . " the princely collections will abstain from making loans available to germany as long as the application of fundamental principles of the rule of law by the federal republic seems questionable as far as liechtenstein is concerned , " reads a statement from the prince 's office .
all other art loans have also been put on hold for the time being . tit for tax scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein officials feel the data theft violated their sovereignty the move comes after a massive scandal involving rich germans who have set up foundations in liechtenstein to avoid paying taxes at home .
german officials apparently paid more than four million euros -lrb- $ 6.14 million -rrb- for data on the tax culprits that had been stolen from a liechtenstein bank . the subsequent investigation has led to the downfall of one of germany 's most prominent business leaders , klaus zumwinkel , who resigned from his position as ceo of deutsche post . some 600 other germans also appear on the list of tax evaders , and many more countries , including the united states , britain and australia , have begun checking the data for the names of their own citizens . bye-bye , biedermeier at munich 's neue pinakothek museum , where some 60 paintings and 120 drawings from liechtenstein had been scheduled to go on display in an exhibition of viennese biedermeier art on may 25 , curator herbert rott was clearly disappointed by liechtenstein 's loan boycott . " needless to say it 's bitter that we 've been hit like that , " he said , according to ap news service .
rott added that he hoped the show could be restaged at a later date . according to information on the official web site of liechtenstein 's art collections , the princely treasures include major european works of art spanning five centuries .

austrian newsstands this year are selling papers published during the time of nazi rule .
the project shows how local and foreign press saw the era . a grainy image of a procession of uniformed nazis marching somberly through the center of austria 's capital covers the front page of the daily neuigkeits-welt-blatt above the headline " the ' day of the legion ' in vienna . " " everywhere heart-felt rallies were given for the legionnaires , the self-sacrificing pioneers of the national socialist movement in german-austria , " the caption reads . the legionnaires had indeed had their day , as they could finally admit publicly to their allegiance to the previously banned nazi party without fear of reprisals .
the national socialists were fully in control and gleichschaltung , the forced coordination of austrian society , was well underway , just three weeks after nazi germany 's annexation of its neighbor , on march 12 , 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspapers are accompanied by explanatory texts the neuigkeits-welt-blatt may no longer exist , but it 's received tens of thousands of new readers due to a newspaper project running throughout 2008 , the 70th anniversary of the nazi power grab in austria .
in 52 weekly editions , " nachrichten " aims to show how the domestic and international media portrayed austria under the national socialists . eyewitness insights each edition of " nachrichten " is made up of two facsimiles of original newspapers , which are folded into an oversized cover printed with explanatory texts that provide background and context to understand the papers ' articles . the name " nachrichten " is a play on the word for " news , " nachrichten .

it 's meant to give people a sense of how the contemporaneous press interpreted nazi austria from both inside and outside the country . " we want to show how the media was used to facilitate this system , how the construction of reality was facilitated by the media , " hausjell said . the initiative stems from british publisher albertas ltd , which has done similar projects in denmark , finland , greece and spain , and puts out " nachrichten " in cooperation with austria 's national library and the documentation center of austrian resistance . little need for coercion one of the nazis ' first steps in consolidating power was to take control of the media , which happened overnight , as they occupied editorial offices throughout the country .

about 65,000 of the 6 million jews killed in the holocaust were austrian . foolhardy allies but after the war , the country was slow to acknowledge its embrace of nazi germany and its complicity in nazi crimes .

the " quaero " search engine project involves 23 companies led by french technology giant thomson .
quaero , which is latin for " i search , " has n't yet got off the ground due to a lack of funding .
its estimated costs for the first five years are projected at 199 million euros , half of which france - which has championed the idea - has agreed to fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's chirac stood behind the idea for quaero the quaero project made headlines in 2005 , when france and germany proposed a search engine to take on the all-powerful , english-language based , google , which opponents felt was developing a dangerous de-facto monopoly on internet information .
following an " in-depth examination , " the european commission decided that the quaero project " brings positive externalities for the community as a whole . "
eu allows " limited " competition distortion however quaero " is not spontaneously underpinned by the market owing to divergent interests within the consortium and to uncertainties regarding the project 's chances of success , " the eu 's executive arm said in a statement .
any resultant distortions in competition " should be limited , " it added .
" we are confident that the positive contribution the program will make to european research will outweigh any distortion of competition caused by the aid , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
thomson 's targeted clients for quaero are internet network operators , content distributors and film production studios .
when developed , it will be available for personal computers , mobile phones , televisions and other platforms .
initial plan gone awry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia is also trying to compete against google the project met with criticism after it was unveiled by then-french president jacques chirac .
search engine experts cited by the financial times called the plan " a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism , " with the main critique being that by the time of quaero 's launch , the search engine market will be a generation ahead of quaero in media and device capabilities .
finally , in late 2006 some of the german developers left the project , deciding to work on a scaled-down version of their search engine , called " theseus , " named after the greek mythological figure who found his way out of the minotaur 's maze . ultimately , the french and german sides diverged over the basic concept of what a new search engine should focus on , news reports said .
the germans wanted to emphasize word-based searches , whereas the french side focused on multimedia .
china , japan also aim to compete speaking in 2006 when the split occurred , francois bourdoncle , ceo of french company exalead , said : " germany 's withdrawal reflects mainly one fact : the orientation that germany wanted for the project was not along the same lines as the one that france favored . "
the european commission last year approved a german aid scheme for theseus .

oh , just a couple of old bones it 's not unusual for customs officers to have to deal with the occasional body .
usually , the deceased turn up in coffins .
two ladies , who recently stopped at munich airport , chose another container for a dead relative . when munich officers asked the two women to open their sealed suitcase , they discovered that the travelers , both in their 60s , had placed the skull and several bones of a man inside . flying to italy via munich from brazil , the women had brought along the man 's remains to fulfill his wish of finding his final resting place in italy .
according to documents , he had already died 11 years earlier in sao paolo . while the bavarian officials were understandably surprised about the mode of transport , they did allow the women to continue their journey .
after all , they had all the necessary documents to bring the bones to naples . and who 's to say that a koffer , or suitcase in german , ca n't work just as well as a coffin ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the obama and clinton camps passed through mississippi on their own inevitable journey to what now seems an unavoidable showdown at their party 's convention in denver in august .
rallies were held , speeches were given and town hall style meetings were conducted but there was never a sense that proceedings here in the magnolia state would be decisive .
that 's a pity , in a way - nominations for the presidency are normally sorted out long before we reach this point in the electoral calendar , and democratic political activists here threw themselves into the race with huge energy .
in part , of course , the lack of drama is simple enough to explain - mississippi is very small - there were only 33 pledged delegates up for grabs here out of the 2,025 overall that the successful candidate will need to win the nomination .
you can draw your own conclusions from the fact that neither of the two candidates was in mississippi when the results began to emerge soon after the polls closed .
nasty tone hillary clinton did her best to undermine mr obama 's latest win as she left the magnolia state for next month 's battleground of pennsylvania , implying that she 'd never expected to win anyway .
" some people , " she explained , " have said ' well mississippi is very much a state that will most likely be in favour of senator obama . '
i said ' well , that 's fine ' , but i want people in mississippi to know i 'm for you . "
mr obama was in his home base of chicago as election officials in jackson compiled the mississippi results , but he was quick to point out that this was another state which had supported what he portrays as a kind of crusade for change in the way politics is transacted in washington .
asked about the occasionally nasty tone of the contest these days , mr obama demonstrated that he too is getting better at getting in a little dig , as he gets his point across .
" we 've been very measured in terms of how we talk about senator clinton ...
i 've been careful to say that i think senator clinton is a capable person .
i 'm not sure we 've been getting that same approach from the clinton campaign . "
negative perceptions a careful sifting of the detailed evidence from mississippi , by the way , provides plenty of material to fuel the secret anxieties of both candidates . "
mr obama has to be a candidate who happens to be black , rather than a black candidate " mr obama , for example , won more than 90 % of black votes , but only about a quarter of white voters supported him .

it seems reasonable to assume that those negative perceptions among her own party 's voters are shared by the kind of independents she would need to attract if she were to end up fighting republican john mccain for the white house .
backroom horse-trading it is not surprising that there is an increasing edge to the race these days - the democratic system of sharing out the delegates in each state according to the proportion of primary votes won by each candidate means that decisive victories are frustratingly difficult to achieve .
democratic delegate race barack obama : 1,596 delegates won on 11 march : 17 total states won : 26 hillary clinton : 1,484 delegates won on 11 march : 11 total states won : 16 delegates needed to secure nomination : 2,025 .

we 've never had a race between two equally popular front-runners before , and it is for that reason that we can predict with growing confidence that the contest will go on beyond the last primary to the august convention in denver , and give us a taste of the old backroom horse-trading that the primary system was designed to replace .
so the two campaigns are roaming from state to state acquiring delegates , although it is not likely that either side will reach the magic 2,025 mark before the end of the race .
intriguingly , we can already see what form the debate between the two campaigns will take in august .
the obama camp will argue that he has won more states , more votes -lrb- at the moment -rrb- and has more delegates than hillary clinton .
she will argue that she has won the big states -lrb- california , texas , ohio , new york and new jersey -rrb- while he has won among democrats in lots of small states -lrb- hawaii -rrb- , many of which will vote republican in a general election anyway -lrb- wyoming -rrb- .
his camp will counter that he is good at winning new votes , while states like new york and california will vote for whoever ends up as the democratic nominee .
it will be for the so-called super-delegates to choose between them - they are the elected representatives and party officials who effectively have a kind of casting vote at the convention .
they will be busy , but i bet you they make a little time to consider changing party rules to make the primary system itself a little clearer , and a little more decisive too .

barack obama 's win in mississippi gives him a boost but not a victory the obama and clinton camps passed through mississippi on their own inevitable journey to what now seems an unavoidable showdown at their party 's convention in denver in august .
rallies were held , speeches were given and town hall style meetings were conducted but there was never a sense that proceedings here in the magnolia state would be decisive .
that 's a pity , in a way - nominations for the presidency are normally sorted out long before we reach this point in the electoral calendar , and democratic political activists here threw themselves into the race with huge energy .
in part , of course , the lack of drama is simple enough to explain - mississippi is very small - there were only 33 pledged delegates up for grabs here out of the 2,025 overall that the successful candidate will need to win the nomination .
you can draw your own conclusions from the fact that neither of the two candidates was in mississippi when the results began to emerge soon after the polls closed .
nasty tone hillary clinton did her best to undermine mr obama 's latest win as she left the magnolia state for next month 's battleground of pennsylvania , implying that she 'd never expected to win anyway .
hillary clinton implied she had never expected to win in mississippi " some people , " she explained , " have said ' well mississippi is very much a state that will most likely be in favour of senator obama . '
i said ' well , that 's fine ' , but i want people in mississippi to know i 'm for you . "
mr obama was in his home base of chicago as election officials in jackson compiled the mississippi results , but he was quick to point out that this was another state which had supported what he portrays as a kind of crusade for change in the way politics is transacted in washington .
asked about the occasionally nasty tone of the contest these days , mr obama demonstrated that he too is getting better at getting in a little dig , as he gets his point across .
" we 've been very measured in terms of how we talk about senator clinton ...
i 've been careful to say that i think senator clinton is a capable person .
i 'm not sure we 've been getting that same approach from the clinton campaign . "
negative perceptions a careful sifting of the detailed evidence from mississippi , by the way , provides plenty of material to fuel the secret anxieties of both candidates .
mr obama has to be a candidate who happens to be black , rather than a black candidate mr obama , for example , won more than 90 % of black votes , but only about a quarter of white voters supported him .
if he is to win nationwide , let alone eventually win the white house , he has got to keep proving that he is good at winning white votes too .

you can draw your own conclusions from the fact that neither of the two candidates was in mississippi when the results began to emerge soon after the polls closed .
nasty tone hillary clinton did her best to undermine mr obama 's latest win as she left the magnolia state for next month 's battleground of pennsylvania , implying that she 'd never expected to win anyway .
hillary clinton implied she had never expected to win in mississippi " some people , " she explained , " have said ' well mississippi is very much a state that will most likely be in favour of senator obama . '
i said ' well , that 's fine ' , but i want people in mississippi to know i 'm for you . "
mr obama was in his home base of chicago as election officials in jackson compiled the mississippi results , but he was quick to point out that this was another state which had supported what he portrays as a kind of crusade for change in the way politics is transacted in washington .
asked about the occasionally nasty tone of the contest these days , mr obama demonstrated that he too is getting better at getting in a little dig , as he gets his point across .
" we 've been very measured in terms of how we talk about senator clinton ...
i 've been careful to say that i think senator clinton is a capable person .
i 'm not sure we 've been getting that same approach from the clinton campaign . "
negative perceptions a careful sifting of the detailed evidence from mississippi , by the way , provides plenty of material to fuel the secret anxieties of both candidates .
mr obama has to be a candidate who happens to be black , rather than a black candidate mr obama , for example , won more than 90 % of black votes , but only about a quarter of white voters supported him .
if he is to win nationwide , let alone eventually win the white house , he has got to keep proving that he is good at winning white votes too .
mr obama has to be a candidate who happens to be black , rather than a black candidate .
for mrs clinton , there is the news in one exit poll that only slightly more than half of voters regard her as honest and trustworthy - an area in which she trails mr obama by miles .
it seems reasonable to assume that those negative perceptions among her own party 's voters are shared by the kind of independents she would need to attract if she were to end up fighting republican john mccain for the white house .
backroom horse-trading it is not surprising that there is an increasing edge to the race these days - the democratic system of sharing out the delegates in each state according to the proportion of primary votes won by each candidate means that decisive victories are frustratingly difficult to achieve .
democratic delegate race barack obama : 1,596 delegates won on 11 march : 17 total states won : 26 hillary clinton : 1,484 delegates won on 11 march : 11 total states won : 16 delegates needed to secure nomination : 2,025 .

we 've never had a race between two equally popular front-runners before , and it is for that reason that we can predict with growing confidence that the contest will go on beyond the last primary to the august convention in denver , and give us a taste of the old backroom horse-trading that the primary system was designed to replace .
so the two campaigns are roaming from state to state acquiring delegates , although it is not likely that either side will reach the magic 2,025 mark before the end of the race .
intriguingly , we can already see what form the debate between the two campaigns will take in august .
the obama camp will argue that he has won more states , more votes -lrb- at the moment -rrb- and has more delegates than hillary clinton .
mrs clinton can claim she has won the big states like texas she will argue that she has won the big states -lrb- california , texas , ohio , new york and new jersey -rrb- while he has won among democrats in lots of small states -lrb- hawaii -rrb- , many of which will vote republican in a general election anyway -lrb- wyoming -rrb- .
his camp will counter that he is good at winning new votes , while states like new york and california will vote for whoever ends up as the democratic nominee .
it will be for the so-called super-delegates to choose between them - they are the elected representatives and party officials who effectively have a kind of casting vote at the convention .
they will be busy , but i bet you they make a little time to consider changing party rules to make the primary system itself a little clearer , and a little more decisive too .

barack obama 's win in mississippi gives him a boost but not a victory the obama and clinton camps passed through mississippi on their own inevitable journey to what now seems an unavoidable showdown at their party 's convention in denver in august .
rallies were held , speeches were given and town hall style meetings were conducted but there was never a sense that proceedings here in the magnolia state would be decisive .
that 's a pity , in a way - nominations for the presidency are normally sorted out long before we reach this point in the electoral calendar , and democratic political activists here threw themselves into the race with huge energy .

mission controllers in toulouse sent up commands to the vehicle on tuesday that brought the thrusters and an electronic control box back online .
the truck has now begun the climb to the space station from the 260km-high orbit in which it was initially placed .
the atv is expected to dock with the platform on 3 april .
it is carrying just under five tonnes of food , water , air , fuel and equipment for the station 's astronauts .
the automated transfer vehicle - dubbed jules verne for this mission - is the biggest , most complex spacecraft ever flown by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
the truck has advanced systems that allow it to find its own way to the 340km-high station and dock with it .
the freighter is the way europe will pay for its membership of the international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- project .
four vehicles will follow this initial flight .
redundant systems the atv can not approach the station until after space shuttle endeavour , launched on tuesday , has completed its mission .
the vehicle will use the time to practise stop-go manoeuvres , including a demonstration of its collision avoidance capability .
this is an emergency stop and rapid reverse .
this would be used if something went wrong in the final approach and there was a danger of the freighter crashing into the platform .
jules verne was launched on sunday by an ariane 5 rocket from the kourou spaceport in french guiana .
shortly after it was deployed , engineers received data indicating a large difference in pressures between the oxidiser and the fuel going through one of the atv 's four " propulsion chains " .
these are complex networks of pipes and valves leading from the fuel tanks to the thrusters .
as a precaution , the anomalous chain - comprising seven of the atv 's 28 attitude control jets and one of its four main engines - was shut down .
spare propulsion capacity on the spacecraft meant the freighter 's operation was never compromised , but engineers said they wanted to resolve the glitch as soon as possible .
that fix was initiated on tuesday and involved first disabling all the propulsion chains before then progressively bringing them all back online .

mission controllers in toulouse sent up commands to the vehicle on tuesday that brought the thrusters and an electronic control box back online .
the truck has now begun the climb to the space station from the 260km-high orbit in which it was initially placed .
the atv is expected to dock with the platform on 3 april .
it is carrying just under five tonnes of food , water , air , fuel and equipment for the station 's astronauts .
the automated transfer vehicle - dubbed jules verne for this mission - is the biggest , most complex spacecraft ever flown by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
the truck has advanced systems that allow it to find its own way to the 340km-high station and dock with it .
the freighter is the way europe will pay for its membership of the international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- project .
four vehicles will follow this initial flight .
redundant systems the atv can not approach the station until after space shuttle endeavour , launched on tuesday , has completed its mission .
the vehicle will use the time to practise stop-go manoeuvres , including a demonstration of its collision avoidance capability .
this is an emergency stop and rapid reverse .
this would be used if something went wrong in the final approach and there was a danger of the freighter crashing into the platform .
jules verne was launched on sunday by an ariane 5 rocket from the kourou spaceport in french guiana .
shortly after it was deployed , engineers received data indicating a large difference in pressures between the oxidiser and the fuel going through one of the atv 's four " propulsion chains " .
these are complex networks of pipes and valves leading from the fuel tanks to the thrusters .
as a precaution , the anomalous chain - comprising seven of the atv 's 28 attitude control jets and one of its four main engines - was shut down .
spare propulsion capacity on the spacecraft meant the freighter 's operation was never compromised , but engineers said they wanted to resolve the glitch as soon as possible .
that fix was initiated on tuesday and involved first disabling all the propulsion chains before then progressively bringing them all back online .

but a six month delay in the completion of the building , the senedd , led to additional costs of £ 794,000 , according to the wales audit office -lrb- wao -rrb- report .
increased construction costs and a big rise in information and communication technology -lrb- ict -rrb- has been blamed .
the total final budget for the senedd increased from £ 66m to £ 70m . "
an excellent project which led to an iconic building of architectural significance that everyone in wales can be proud of " lord dafydd-elis thomas , assembly commission chair despite savings in a number of areas within the project , there was an extra £ 2.6m for security measures , an extra £ 2.8m for works at the rear of the building , and £ 1.8m on other external works .
the cost of ict and broadcasting equipment also increased from £ 6.7m to £ 8.2m.
auditor general jeremy colman said the project was a " success story " .
" the second phase of the project to build the senedd clearly benefited from lessons learned in the first , " he said .
" new processes , tighter financial forecasting and better project management resulted in the successful delivery of the national assembly 's cardiff headquarters .
" i hope my recommendations will ensure that these important lessons will influence future similar projects , " mr colman added .
dust damage the report also notes that an overlap between construction work and the installation of ict equipment meant that dust caused by construction works caused damage estimated to be between £ 10,000 and £ 12,000 .
the document states that problems such as a leaking roof and leaching of salt on the steps in front of the building did not result in extra costs .
this was because the building contract included a 12-month defects liability period , which has since been extended , and " appropriate levels of retention monies have been withheld until those defects are resolved " according to the report .
the senedd was specifically designed to be an " exemplar " of " sustainable construction " operating to the highest environmental standards .
but the wao report notes that electricity costs have exceeded original estimates by as much as 50 % due , in part at least , to the building being open to the public for seven rather than five days a week .
the report concludes that the project was handled well by the welsh assembly government and that around £ 16m of the total construction price was spent on welsh services , labour and materials .
the final cost of the project was £ 70m - £ 4m more than the previous revised estimate of £ 66m .
but the report recommended more detailed specifications be made for any future major projects and that the assembly government " formalise " any lessons learnt .
it also calls for the assembly commission , the body which manages the senedd , to produce regular reports on the building 's performance .
' iconic building ' commission chair and presiding officer lord dafydd elis-thomas said he was delighted with the report .
" this was an excellent project which led to an iconic building of architectural significance that everyone in wales can be proud of , " he said .
" we have a wonderful building designed to the very highest environmental standards , and it is essential that we ensure these high standards are met , " lord elis-thomas added .

an excellent project which led to an iconic building of architectural significance that everyone in wales can be proud of lord dafydd-elis thomas , assembly commission chair despite savings in a number of areas within the project , there was an extra £ 2.6m for security measures , an extra £ 2.8m for works at the rear of the building , and £ 1.8m on other external works .
the cost of ict and broadcasting equipment also increased from £ 6.7m to £ 8.2m.
auditor general jeremy colman said the project was a " success story " .
" the second phase of the project to build the senedd clearly benefited from lessons learned in the first , " he said .
" new processes , tighter financial forecasting and better project management resulted in the successful delivery of the national assembly 's cardiff headquarters .
" i hope my recommendations will ensure that these important lessons will influence future similar projects , " mr colman added .
dust damage the report also notes that an overlap between construction work and the installation of ict equipment meant that dust caused by construction works caused damage estimated to be between £ 10,000 and £ 12,000 .
the document states that problems such as a leaking roof and leaching of salt on the steps in front of the building did not result in extra costs .
this was because the building contract included a 12-month defects liability period , which has since been extended , and " appropriate levels of retention monies have been withheld until those defects are resolved " according to the report .
the senedd was specifically designed to be an " exemplar " of " sustainable construction " operating to the highest environmental standards .
it was designed to have high environmental operating standards but the wao report notes that electricity costs have exceeded original estimates by as much as 50 % due , in part at least , to the building being open to the public for seven rather than five days a week .
the report concludes that the project was handled well by the welsh assembly government and that around £ 16m of the total construction price was spent on welsh services , labour and materials .
the final cost of the project was £ 70m - £ 4m more than the previous revised estimate of £ 66m .
but the report recommended more detailed specifications be made for any future major projects and that the assembly government " formalise " any lessons learnt .
it also calls for the assembly commission , the body which manages the senedd , to produce regular reports on the building 's performance .
' iconic building ' commission chair and presiding officer lord dafydd elis-thomas said he was delighted with the report .
" this was an excellent project which led to an iconic building of architectural significance that everyone in wales can be proud of , " he said .
" we have a wonderful building designed to the very highest environmental standards , and it is essential that we ensure these high standards are met , " lord elis-thomas added .
