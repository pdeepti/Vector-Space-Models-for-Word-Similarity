program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.03.2008 germany , us to improve data exchange in terrorism fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement will make it easier to check fingerprints the united states and germany plan to speed up the exchange of information to help in anti-terror efforts .
washington said it hopes the groundbreaking deal will serve as a model for cooperation with other countries . under the new information sharing agreement , us and german law enforcement officials will have immediate , albeit partial , access to each other 's fingerprint and dna databases . the move will allow authorities to check within minutes if a database contains a suspected terrorist 's personal information .
should a match be found , authorities would then have to submit a request for more detailed information . the effort will speed up the exchange of information and help in the terrorist fight , said german and us officials who met in berlin to launch the bilateral agreement on tuesday , march 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal between berlin and washington could be a model for other bilateral agreements us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and us attorney general michael mukasey travelled to berlin to meet with german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries .
the deal will need german parliamentary ratification before becoming law , which schaeuble said he hopes will happen by the end of 2008 . " it is imperative as peace-loving nations we continue to work together to counter the threat of terrorism and to cooperate in this effort using every tool at our disposal , " chertoff said . a direct " hit " the cooperation includes a " hit / no-hit " procedure whereby a country can access another country 's national dna and fingerprint database and determine whether it contains a terror suspect 's data .
if a " hit " occurs , a formal application can be made for further information . " there is no automated exchange of information as such , but only an automated exchange of information on whether there is information available or not , " schaeuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much information should be shared ?
the exception is dna files , which are not allowed to be automatically shared under us law , schaeuble said . but the plan still raises privacy concerns , germany 's independent privacy commissioner peter schaar said on german public radio deutschlandfunk . schaar gave the example of a protestor who is fingerprinted by german police .
the information might be important to german officials , " but does that give the right to the united states , when i travel there and maybe have the wrong stamp in my passport , to get access to this data ?
i would say no , " schaar said . erosion of civil liberties ? zypries said she was not concerned that the agreement would erode civil liberties . " the data that is transferred can only be used in areas covered by the agreement and not for example as evidence in ongoing criminal cases , " zypries said at the joint news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians have called for greater cooperation " we have ensured that there is an obligation that automated requests for information and replies are recorded ... and , of course , there is an obligation for the data to be destroyed " if it is not used , she said . privacy has become a major issue in germany in recent years , with law enforcement agencies claiming they need more latitude to do their jobs .
while courts have granted partial victories to those who advocate for more electronic surveillance , there 's a sense that courts are sensitive to rights issues . on tuesday , germany 's highest court ruled that a police practice of automatically scanning license plates to check them against a list of suspects violates the country 's constitution .
the court said the surveillance technique was too broad and allowed authorities to do things such as profile an individual 's movements . following a european model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chertoff said the deal includes " robust privacy protection " the deal is modeled on the pruem treaty signed by seven european union countries including germany in 2005 .
the treaty was drawn up following train bombings in madrid by islamist radicals in 2004 which killed 191 people .
the treaty allows law enforcement in signatory countries to compare and exchange data more easily . the us is in preliminary talks with other countries on similar bilateral agreements . " this is a wonderful model , " mukasey said .
" i hope others will follow shortly . " chertoff added that europe and the us needed to cooperate in their efforts fighting international terrorism . " we are indeed fighting a networked , international enemy and , therefore , we have to respond with global networks of our own , " chertoff said .
" today 's agreement between the united states and germany reinforces our collective commitment to combat global terrorism while ensuring robust privacy protection . " germany has n't suffered a major attack the deal comes six months after german authorities made three arrests in an alleged plot to attack us interests and citizens in germany .
us intelligence had passed on information to berlin on the plan . two of the men arrested in september were german converts to islam and a third was turkish .
all had gone to pakistan for training and were stockpiling chemicals to make car bombs .
among the targets were us military installations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 11.03.2008 swiss coach gradually reviving hertha berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how long can the happiness at hertha last ?
at the start of 2008 , many german soccer experts picked hertha to be relegated .
but after a five-game undefeated streak , things are looking up in berlin .
that 's partly down to the work of their swiss coach , lucien favre . even hardcore hertha fans have trouble identifying all the players on the field these days - but that does n't mean they 're unhappy . after falling perilously close to the relegation zone , berlin has earned three wins and two draws in their last five matches , creating a comfortable cushion between themselves and the second division . what 's more , the team is playing arguably their most attacking , attractive soccer since 2000 , when berlin competed in the champions league . when hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness brought in swiss coach lucien favre in the off-season , he announced that 2007/08 would be a transitional year .
that was no exaggeration . gone are brazilian stars like gilberto and marcelinho , as well as problematic young talents such as kevin-prince boateng and ashkan dejagah .
taking their place are decidedly unfamiliar names like rudolf skacel and gojko kacar . so what are the reasons for hertha 's minor renaissance ? from cheese to clockwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre was hired in 2007 to re-route a team headed nowhere one major factor is that lucien favre has put his stamp on a squad often dismissed as uncoachable . favre - an extremely gifted soccer player whose own career was cut short by injury - favors what he calls " polyvalent " players .
what he means primarily are defensively solid midfielders who can advance the ball with one-touch passing . the formula definitely worked at favre 's previous club , fc zurich - they won two swiss league titles . the most obvious benefit of this philosophy for berlin has been defensive stability .
hertha conceded 55 goals in 34 bundesliga games in the 2007 calendar year - whereas after six games in 2008 , they 've let in a mere five . favre has also proven willing to improvise , scrapping his preferred back four for a 3-2-3-1-1 formation to better utilize hertha 's current personnel . berlin 's defense , which had been reminiscent of swiss cheese , is now working with some much-needed clockmaker 's precision . green but game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a revamped hertha squad beat defending champs stuttgart in february on the offensive end , hertha 's improvement under favre is n't as noticeable in the statistics . that 's partially due to the fact that hertha are fielding a young squad .
in their most recent match against dortmund , seven players out of the starting 11 were under the age of 25 . favre 's youngsters often lose their nerve when trying to make a precision last pass or convert opportunities .
in both of their draws this year , hertha were the stronger side and could have won with better finishing . on the plus side , the generational conflict that has plagued berlin in the last few seasons appears to have been laid to rest .
the youngsters respect the veterans ' authority , and experienced players have accepted a seat on the bench without much complaint . " if the players have an intelligence for the game , hierarchy is not a problem , " favre told dw-tv . berlin 's success rate with transfers has also improved since favre got involved .
in addition to skacel and kacar , striker raffael , midfielder fabian lustenberger and defender steve von bergen have all proved worthwhile additions to the squad . " you have to study a player very closely , " favre said .
" and if you make a mistake , you have a player under contract for two , three or even four years .
that 's expensive and creates a problem .
especially for the coach . " the pantelic situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marko pantelic - will he stay or will he go now ?
rarely has the mood been more harmonious at hertha .
indeed the only serious point of friction , for the moment , is between favre and hertha 's top performer , forward marko pantelic . the serbian striker has scored 11 goals this season , but berlin 's tabloids have repeatedly reported that favre considers pantelic too egotistic and would like to ship him off the coach is at pains to deny that . " if you want to get to the top , you have to emphasize the positive , " favre said .
" pantelic is trying hard to improve and play the sort of game i want . " nonetheless , should hertha , still burdened by millions in debt , be offered a hefty transfer fee for the serb , they might be tempted to take the money and extend favre 's rebuilding experiment . dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off , which airs thursday , march 13 , features an extensive interview with hertha coach lucien favre . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political ideology was their main motivation , both in east and west germany . around 189,000 people were informers the secret police of the gdr 's communist regime , when the berlin wall fell in 1989 - that 's according to thuringia 's state office for researching east germany 's stasi on monday , march 10 . previously , the number of stasi informers in 1989 had been estimated at 174,000 .

she stressed that germany would not lift restrictions on troops in the country . the trans-atlantic alliance is a pillar of germany 's foreign and security policy , but it has to move away from purely military thinking , she told a meeting of german armed forces commanders in berlin on monday , march 10 . the chancellor also affirmed germany 's opposition to extending its military role in afghanistan to the volatile south , a move requested by the united states and other nato members . she said her country 's nato-led troops were needed in the relatively peaceful north , where they were engaged mainly in civilian reconstruction projects . nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told the gathering that afghanistan should not be divided into spheres of responsibility for peacekeeping , combat operations and reconstruction . the country would be won or lost in its entirety , he said . everyone 's a target in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : focusing on reconstruction is n't a guarantee of safety for german troops those building schools in the north are just as much a target of the taliban as those fighting the country 's former fundamentalist rulers in the south , he said . germany has around 3,500 troops serving with the 40,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan as well as a squad of military-surveillance aircraft .
berlin is scheduled to increase the number of troops stationed in afghanistan this summer . merkel said that while nato spoke of a comprehensive approach combining demands to focus on fighting the taliban and the desire for reconstruction there was little to be seen of this strategy in practice . calling for structured and effective coordination , the chancellor said there could be civil reconstruction without security but no security without civil reconstruction . alliance 's internal differences non-governmental organizations should also be included in this comprehensive approach , she added . her remarks highlighted differences within nato on the issue , with the united states believing that fighting insurgency in afghanistan should have priority over reconstruction . us , british , dutch and canadian soldiers have borne the brunt of the fight against the taliban in the south amid reluctance from allies like germany , france and italy to send their troops there . nato expansion questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer has repeatedly asked nato members to lift national troop restrictions merkel also voiced skepticism about nato expansion plans , saying states involved in regional conflicts should not become members of the alliance , an apparent reference to ukraine and georgia . " a country should become a nato member not only when its temporary political leadership is in favor but when a significant percentage of the population supports membership , " merkel said . ukraine and georgia participate in nato 's intensified dialogue program and aspire to become full members one day .
kyiv and tbilisi are expected to use the nato military alliance 's april 2-4 summit in romania to confirm that they are candidates to join the alliance , but their chances of securing a formal invitation seem remote . ukraine 's leaders have asked to join nato 's membership action plan , but lack public support for the move .
in georgia , the public is largely in favor of nato membership , but the alliance was made uneasy by the state of emergency the government imposed in december to end opposition protests . outgoing russian president vladimir putin has criticized nato 's expansion plans , accusing the alliance of trying to replace the united nations . georgia has unresolved disputes with abkhazia and south ossetia , while ukraine has been locked in a clinch with moscow over payments for fuel supplies . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 11.03.2008 german investors confident despite soaring euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin said it 's not concerned the euro 's value will hurt germany 's export-heavy economy surprise results from a key investor confidence survey have helped the euro to another all-time high against the dollar .
though the imbalance could hurt the economy , some investors apparently see blue skies ahead . the euro 's rise on foreign exchange markets could endanger economic growth in the euro zone , the european union 's slovenian presidency said on tuesday , march 11 , as the euro hit a record high just shy of $ 1.55 . " of course this is a problem that we are witnessing on a daily basis , " slovenia 's finance minister andrej bajuk said in an internet broadcast .
" we have come to the conclusion that these movements may not have a positive effect when it comes to economic growth and development . " the value of the euro , the currency in 15 european countries , has continued to climb as experts say the us economy slips toward a recession . " we believe that exchange rates should ... reflect the realities of the economy , " bajuk said .
" we also believe the foundations of the european economy are solid and wholesome . " the european central bank chief jean-claude trichet had on monday said he was " concerned by the excessive exchange rate fluctuations . "
the eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia also said currency markets were among his key concerns . " the excessive volatility indeed is a matter of concern , " he told journalists on monday . german economy to survive turmoil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking up , some economists say tuesday 's jump followed the announcement of better-than-expected investor sentiment in germany . " experts are more optimistic for the growth of the us economy in the next six months , " the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said in a statement accompanying its monthly report .
" moreover , they expect the dollar to appreciate versus the euro .
this should benefit export-oriented sectors of the german economy . " zew 's economic indicator for germany rose 7.5 points in march to minus 32.0 points after plummeting to minus 39.5 in february , the lowest point since january 1993 .
economists had predicted it would drop to below minus 40 points . " the optimism of the financial analysts is presumably based on the hope that the peak of the financial market crisis will be overcome in half a year and that business dynamics will not weaken more strongly than expected to date , " zew president wolfgang franz said upon the report 's release . though the financial experts surveyed seem to feel good about the near future , they gave a more negative assessment of the current situation in germany .
that indicator dropped by 1.6 points to 32.1 points due to the country 's weak economic growth figures . interest rates to remain stable , exports rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro has continued to reach new highs against the dollar the euro 's leap to nearly $ 1.55 also followed statements tuesday by axel weber , head of germany 's central bank , and a member of the european central bank 's rate-setting council , who ruled out a drop in interest rates . a high euro serves as a double-edged sword for the euro-zone economies .
while essential imports like oil , which is typically priced in dollars , become cheaper , its exports become more expensive abroad , making them less competitive on the global market . since the euro has been on the rise , germany has continued running up large trade surpluses .
according to data released monday , german exports rose by a larger-than-predicted 3.8 percent in january . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she stressed that germany would not lift restrictions on troops in the country . the trans-atlantic alliance is a pillar of germany 's foreign and security policy , but it has to move away from purely military thinking , she told a meeting of german armed forces commanders in berlin on monday , march 10 . the chancellor also affirmed germany 's opposition to extending its military role in afghanistan to the volatile south , a move requested by the united states and other nato members . she said her country 's nato-led troops were needed in the relatively peaceful north , where they were engaged mainly in civilian reconstruction projects . nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told the gathering that afghanistan should not be divided into spheres of responsibility for peacekeeping , combat operations and reconstruction . the country would be won or lost in its entirety , he said . everyone 's a target in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : focusing on reconstruction is n't a guarantee of safety for german troops those building schools in the north are just as much a target of the taliban as those fighting the country 's former fundamentalist rulers in the south , he said . germany has around 3,500 troops serving with the 40,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan as well as a squad of military-surveillance aircraft .
berlin is scheduled to increase the number of troops stationed in afghanistan this summer . merkel said that while nato spoke of a comprehensive approach combining demands to focus on fighting the taliban and the desire for reconstruction there was little to be seen of this strategy in practice . calling for structured and effective coordination , the chancellor said there could be civil reconstruction without security but no security without civil reconstruction . alliance 's internal differences non-governmental organizations should also be included in this comprehensive approach , she added . her remarks highlighted differences within nato on the issue , with the united states believing that fighting insurgency in afghanistan should have priority over reconstruction . us , british , dutch and canadian soldiers have borne the brunt of the fight against the taliban in the south amid reluctance from allies like germany , france and italy to send their troops there . nato expansion questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer has repeatedly asked nato members to lift national troop restrictions merkel also voiced skepticism about nato expansion plans , saying states involved in regional conflicts should not become members of the alliance , an apparent reference to ukraine and georgia . " a country should become a nato member not only when its temporary political leadership is in favor but when a significant percentage of the population supports membership , " merkel said . ukraine and georgia participate in nato 's intensified dialogue program and aspire to become full members one day .
kyiv and tbilisi are expected to use the nato military alliance 's april 2-4 summit in romania to confirm that they are candidates to join the alliance , but their chances of securing a formal invitation seem remote . ukraine 's leaders have asked to join nato 's membership action plan , but lack public support for the move .
in georgia , the public is largely in favor of nato membership , but the alliance was made uneasy by the state of emergency the government imposed in december to end opposition protests . outgoing russian president vladimir putin has criticized nato 's expansion plans , accusing the alliance of trying to replace the united nations . georgia has unresolved disputes with abkhazia and south ossetia , while ukraine has been locked in a clinch with moscow over payments for fuel supplies . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin is scheduled to increase the number of troops stationed in afghanistan this summer . merkel said that while nato spoke of a comprehensive approach combining demands to focus on fighting the taliban and the desire for reconstruction there was little to be seen of this strategy in practice . calling for structured and effective coordination , the chancellor said there could be civil reconstruction without security but no security without civil reconstruction . alliance 's internal differences non-governmental organizations should also be included in this comprehensive approach , she added . her remarks highlighted differences within nato on the issue , with the united states believing that fighting insurgency in afghanistan should have priority over reconstruction . us , british , dutch and canadian soldiers have borne the brunt of the fight against the taliban in the south amid reluctance from allies like germany , france and italy to send their troops there . nato expansion questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer has repeatedly asked nato members to lift national troop restrictions merkel also voiced skepticism about nato expansion plans , saying states involved in regional conflicts should not become members of the alliance , an apparent reference to ukraine and georgia . " a country should become a nato member not only when its temporary political leadership is in favor but when a significant percentage of the population supports membership , " merkel said . ukraine and georgia participate in nato 's intensified dialogue program and aspire to become full members one day .
kyiv and tbilisi are expected to use the nato military alliance 's april 2-4 summit in romania to confirm that they are candidates to join the alliance , but their chances of securing a formal invitation seem remote . ukraine 's leaders have asked to join nato 's membership action plan , but lack public support for the move .
in georgia , the public is largely in favor of nato membership , but the alliance was made uneasy by the state of emergency the government imposed in december to end opposition protests . outgoing russian president vladimir putin has criticized nato 's expansion plans , accusing the alliance of trying to replace the united nations . georgia has unresolved disputes with abkhazia and south ossetia , while ukraine has been locked in a clinch with moscow over payments for fuel supplies . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 11.03.2008 swiss coach gradually reviving hertha berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how long can the happiness at hertha last ?
at the start of 2008 , many german soccer experts picked hertha to be relegated .
but after a five-game undefeated streak , things are looking up in berlin .
that 's partly down to the work of their swiss coach , lucien favre . even hardcore hertha fans have trouble identifying all the players on the field these days - but that does n't mean they 're unhappy . after falling perilously close to the relegation zone , berlin has earned three wins and two draws in their last five matches , creating a comfortable cushion between themselves and the second division . what 's more , the team is playing arguably their most attacking , attractive soccer since 2000 , when berlin competed in the champions league . when hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness brought in swiss coach lucien favre in the off-season , he announced that 2007/08 would be a transitional year .
that was no exaggeration . gone are brazilian stars like gilberto and marcelinho , as well as problematic young talents such as kevin-prince boateng and ashkan dejagah .
taking their place are decidedly unfamiliar names like rudolf skacel and gojko kacar . so what are the reasons for hertha 's minor renaissance ? from cheese to clockwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre was hired in 2007 to re-route a team headed nowhere one major factor is that lucien favre has put his stamp on a squad often dismissed as uncoachable . favre - an extremely gifted soccer player whose own career was cut short by injury - favors what he calls " polyvalent " players .
what he means primarily are defensively solid midfielders who can advance the ball with one-touch passing . the formula definitely worked at favre 's previous club , fc zurich - they won two swiss league titles . the most obvious benefit of this philosophy for berlin has been defensive stability .
hertha conceded 55 goals in 34 bundesliga games in the 2007 calendar year - whereas after six games in 2008 , they 've let in a mere five . favre has also proven willing to improvise , scrapping his preferred back four for a 3-2-3-1-1 formation to better utilize hertha 's current personnel . berlin 's defense , which had been reminiscent of swiss cheese , is now working with some much-needed clockmaker 's precision . green but game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a revamped hertha squad beat defending champs stuttgart in february on the offensive end , hertha 's improvement under favre is n't as noticeable in the statistics . that 's partially due to the fact that hertha are fielding a young squad .
in their most recent match against dortmund , seven players out of the starting 11 were under the age of 25 . favre 's youngsters often lose their nerve when trying to make a precision last pass or convert opportunities .
in both of their draws this year , hertha were the stronger side and could have won with better finishing . on the plus side , the generational conflict that has plagued berlin in the last few seasons appears to have been laid to rest .
the youngsters respect the veterans ' authority , and experienced players have accepted a seat on the bench without much complaint . " if the players have an intelligence for the game , hierarchy is not a problem , " favre told dw-tv . berlin 's success rate with transfers has also improved since favre got involved .
in addition to skacel and kacar , striker raffael , midfielder fabian lustenberger and defender steve von bergen have all proved worthwhile additions to the squad . " you have to study a player very closely , " favre said .
" and if you make a mistake , you have a player under contract for two , three or even four years .
that 's expensive and creates a problem .
especially for the coach . " the pantelic situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marko pantelic - will he stay or will he go now ?
rarely has the mood been more harmonious at hertha .
indeed the only serious point of friction , for the moment , is between favre and hertha 's top performer , forward marko pantelic . the serbian striker has scored 11 goals this season , but berlin 's tabloids have repeatedly reported that favre considers pantelic too egotistic and would like to ship him off the coach is at pains to deny that . " if you want to get to the top , you have to emphasize the positive , " favre said .
" pantelic is trying hard to improve and play the sort of game i want . " nonetheless , should hertha , still burdened by millions in debt , be offered a hefty transfer fee for the serb , they might be tempted to take the money and extend favre 's rebuilding experiment . dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off , which airs thursday , march 13 , features an extensive interview with hertha coach lucien favre . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

though the imbalance could hurt the economy , some investors apparently see blue skies ahead . the euro 's rise on foreign exchange markets could endanger economic growth in the euro zone , the european union 's slovenian presidency said on tuesday , march 11 , as the euro hit a record high just shy of $ 1.55 . " of course this is a problem that we are witnessing on a daily basis , " slovenia 's finance minister andrej bajuk said in an internet broadcast .
" we have come to the conclusion that these movements may not have a positive effect when it comes to economic growth and development . " the value of the euro , the currency in 15 european countries , has continued to climb as experts say the us economy slips toward a recession . " we believe that exchange rates should ... reflect the realities of the economy , " bajuk said .
" we also believe the foundations of the european economy are solid and wholesome . " the european central bank chief jean-claude trichet had on monday said he was " concerned by the excessive exchange rate fluctuations . "
the eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia also said currency markets were among his key concerns . " the excessive volatility indeed is a matter of concern , " he told journalists on monday . german economy to survive turmoil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking up , some economists say tuesday 's jump followed the announcement of better-than-expected investor sentiment in germany . " experts are more optimistic for the growth of the us economy in the next six months , " the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said in a statement accompanying its monthly report .
" moreover , they expect the dollar to appreciate versus the euro .
this should benefit export-oriented sectors of the german economy . " zew 's economic indicator for germany rose 7.5 points in march to minus 32.0 points after plummeting to minus 39.5 in february , the lowest point since january 1993 .
economists had predicted it would drop to below minus 40 points . " the optimism of the financial analysts is presumably based on the hope that the peak of the financial market crisis will be overcome in half a year and that business dynamics will not weaken more strongly than expected to date , " zew president wolfgang franz said upon the report 's release . though the financial experts surveyed seem to feel good about the near future , they gave a more negative assessment of the current situation in germany .
that indicator dropped by 1.6 points to 32.1 points due to the country 's weak economic growth figures . interest rates to remain stable , exports rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro has continued to reach new highs against the dollar the euro 's leap to nearly $ 1.55 also followed statements tuesday by axel weber , head of germany 's central bank , and a member of the european central bank 's rate-setting council , who ruled out a drop in interest rates . a high euro serves as a double-edged sword for the euro-zone economies .
while essential imports like oil , which is typically priced in dollars , become cheaper , its exports become more expensive abroad , making them less competitive on the global market . since the euro has been on the rise , germany has continued running up large trade surpluses .
according to data released monday , german exports rose by a larger-than-predicted 3.8 percent in january . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washington said it hopes the groundbreaking deal will serve as a model for cooperation with other countries . under the new information sharing agreement , us and german law enforcement officials will have immediate , albeit partial , access to each other 's fingerprint and dna databases . the move will allow authorities to check within minutes if a database contains a suspected terrorist 's personal information .
should a match be found , authorities would then have to submit a request for more detailed information . the effort will speed up the exchange of information and help in the terrorist fight , said german and us officials who met in berlin to launch the bilateral agreement on tuesday , march 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal between berlin and washington could be a model for other bilateral agreements us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and us attorney general michael mukasey travelled to berlin to meet with german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries .
the deal will need german parliamentary ratification before becoming law , which schaeuble said he hopes will happen by the end of 2008 . " it is imperative as peace-loving nations we continue to work together to counter the threat of terrorism and to cooperate in this effort using every tool at our disposal , " chertoff said . a direct " hit " the cooperation includes a " hit / no-hit " procedure whereby a country can access another country 's national dna and fingerprint database and determine whether it contains a terror suspect 's data .
if a " hit " occurs , a formal application can be made for further information . " there is no automated exchange of information as such , but only an automated exchange of information on whether there is information available or not , " schaeuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much information should be shared ?
the exception is dna files , which are not allowed to be automatically shared under us law , schaeuble said . but the plan still raises privacy concerns , germany 's independent privacy commissioner peter schaar said on german public radio deutschlandfunk . schaar gave the example of a protestor who is fingerprinted by german police .

while courts have granted partial victories to those who advocate for more electronic surveillance , there 's a sense that courts are sensitive to rights issues . on tuesday , germany 's highest court ruled that a police practice of automatically scanning license plates to check them against a list of suspects violates the country 's constitution .
the court said the surveillance technique was too broad and allowed authorities to do things such as profile an individual 's movements . following a european model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chertoff said the deal includes " robust privacy protection " the deal is modeled on the pruem treaty signed by seven european union countries including germany in 2005 .
the treaty was drawn up following train bombings in madrid by islamist radicals in 2004 which killed 191 people .
the treaty allows law enforcement in signatory countries to compare and exchange data more easily . the us is in preliminary talks with other countries on similar bilateral agreements . " this is a wonderful model , " mukasey said .
" i hope others will follow shortly . " chertoff added that europe and the us needed to cooperate in their efforts fighting international terrorism . " we are indeed fighting a networked , international enemy and , therefore , we have to respond with global networks of our own , " chertoff said .
" today 's agreement between the united states and germany reinforces our collective commitment to combat global terrorism while ensuring robust privacy protection . " germany has n't suffered a major attack the deal comes six months after german authorities made three arrests in an alleged plot to attack us interests and citizens in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 11.03.2008 berlin launches image campaign with new slogan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be partying - berlin is fun regardless of its slogan " be berlin " - that 's the message the german capital wants to project to the world .
the catchphrase is part of a major publicity drive , but some people are asking : what would it mean to be berlin ? be successful berlin mayor klaus wowereit officially launched the slogan on tuesday , march 11 , as part of a 10.6 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- marketing initiative to encourage tourism and enhance the city 's image .
" with the branding campaign , the berlin senate wants to project berlin 's image outside the city , " woworeit said at the launch , " so that more people come visit us , more companies create new jobs here , and scientific , cultural and social richness of the city becomes easier to experience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be mayorial - wowereit 's previous phrase for berlin was " poor but sexy " the catchphrase vaguely echoes john f. kennedy 's " ich bin ein berliner " speech during the cold war and follows in the trend of cities using advertising slogans to brand themselves .
probably the most famous example is the " i love new york " campaign of the late 1970s .
more recently , the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg landed a hit with the slogan " we can do everything but speak proper german . "
berlin is germany 's top destination for tourists , attracting more than 8 million visitors and earning between 8 and 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12-14.5 billion -rrb- from them annually .
that 's a business berlin wants to expand .
be stranded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be building - construction sites are still all over the capital but the catchphrase has left many people scratching their heads as to what precisely one would be , if one were to choose to " be berlin " - all the more so since the debt-ridden capital is known just as much for being chaotic as it is for being creative .
" all berlin residents should be warned … that the imperative is meant literally , " wrote berlin columnist harald martenstein ahead of the official launch .
" when the first ' be berlin ' billboards are erected and the entire city populace stops bathing , quits their jobs and throws all their money out the window , saying that the berlin senate told them to do so , we 'll see we 've shot ourselves in the foot . "
indeed , tourists currently visiting berlin are getting a taste for just how disorderly the german capital can be .
the city 's public-transport workers are currently on strike , closing down the vast majority of subways , streetcars and busses and leaving visitors and natives alike to get around the huge metropolis as best they can .
be sarcastic bildunterschrift : be fluffy - some say knut could have come up with a better idea and berliners themselves - at least to judge from the blogs - seem underwhelmed by the campaign , greeting it with their characteristic sarcasm .
some have scoffed that the slogan sounds like a stutter .
others have quipped that a better catchphrase would be " bi berlin , " playing on the city 's tradition of tolerance .
a few berliners have complained that the campaign is in english , not german .
and a great many have speculated about how much the perennially cash-strapped capital paid for the three syllables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be broke - berlin 's debts have meant cuts in services like education " what did those two words cost ? " asked one blogger on the online page of the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" i can only shake my head . "
black humor was another response .
" the money has to be gotten rid of , " wrote a blogger on a page devoted to the capital .
" if it 's left lying around , someone will trip over it .
it 's better to spend it immediately .
then it 's out of the way , and everything 's hunky-dory . "
and with berlin already well known internationally for its nightlife and culture , it 's debatable whether the city really needed help on this score from pr experts .
in the words of one foreign tourist to ap news agency : " i do n't want to be berlin .
i wanted to come here to see the galleries . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the catchphrase is part of a major publicity drive , but some people are asking : what would it mean to be berlin ? be successful berlin mayor klaus wowereit officially launched the slogan on tuesday , march 11 , as part of a 10.6 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- marketing initiative to encourage tourism and enhance the city 's image .
" with the branding campaign , the berlin senate wants to project berlin 's image outside the city , " woworeit said at the launch , " so that more people come visit us , more companies create new jobs here , and scientific , cultural and social richness of the city becomes easier to experience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be mayorial - wowereit 's previous phrase for berlin was " poor but sexy " the catchphrase vaguely echoes john f. kennedy 's " ich bin ein berliner " speech during the cold war and follows in the trend of cities using advertising slogans to brand themselves .
probably the most famous example is the " i love new york " campaign of the late 1970s .
more recently , the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg landed a hit with the slogan " we can do everything but speak proper german . "
berlin is germany 's top destination for tourists , attracting more than 8 million visitors and earning between 8 and 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12-14.5 billion -rrb- from them annually .
that 's a business berlin wants to expand .
be stranded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be building - construction sites are still all over the capital but the catchphrase has left many people scratching their heads as to what precisely one would be , if one were to choose to " be berlin " - all the more so since the debt-ridden capital is known just as much for being chaotic as it is for being creative .
" all berlin residents should be warned … that the imperative is meant literally , " wrote berlin columnist harald martenstein ahead of the official launch .
" when the first ' be berlin ' billboards are erected and the entire city populace stops bathing , quits their jobs and throws all their money out the window , saying that the berlin senate told them to do so , we 'll see we 've shot ourselves in the foot . "
indeed , tourists currently visiting berlin are getting a taste for just how disorderly the german capital can be .
the city 's public-transport workers are currently on strike , closing down the vast majority of subways , streetcars and busses and leaving visitors and natives alike to get around the huge metropolis as best they can .
be sarcastic bildunterschrift : be fluffy - some say knut could have come up with a better idea and berliners themselves - at least to judge from the blogs - seem underwhelmed by the campaign , greeting it with their characteristic sarcasm .
some have scoffed that the slogan sounds like a stutter .
others have quipped that a better catchphrase would be " bi berlin , " playing on the city 's tradition of tolerance .
a few berliners have complained that the campaign is in english , not german .
and a great many have speculated about how much the perennially cash-strapped capital paid for the three syllables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be broke - berlin 's debts have meant cuts in services like education " what did those two words cost ? " asked one blogger on the online page of the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" i can only shake my head . "
black humor was another response .
" the money has to be gotten rid of , " wrote a blogger on a page devoted to the capital .
" if it 's left lying around , someone will trip over it .
it 's better to spend it immediately .
then it 's out of the way , and everything 's hunky-dory . "
and with berlin already well known internationally for its nightlife and culture , it 's debatable whether the city really needed help on this score from pr experts .

washington said it hopes the groundbreaking deal will serve as a model for cooperation with other countries . under the new information sharing agreement , us and german law enforcement officials will have immediate , albeit partial , access to each other 's fingerprint and dna databases . the move will allow authorities to check within minutes if a database contains a suspected terrorist 's personal information .

the deal will need german parliamentary ratification before becoming law , which schaeuble said he hopes will happen by the end of 2008 . " it is imperative as peace-loving nations we continue to work together to counter the threat of terrorism and to cooperate in this effort using every tool at our disposal , " chertoff said . a direct " hit " the cooperation includes a " hit / no-hit " procedure whereby a country can access another country 's national dna and fingerprint database and determine whether it contains a terror suspect 's data .
if a " hit " occurs , a formal application can be made for further information . " there is no automated exchange of information as such , but only an automated exchange of information on whether there is information available or not , " schaeuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much information should be shared ?

while courts have granted partial victories to those who advocate for more electronic surveillance , there 's a sense that courts are sensitive to rights issues . on tuesday , germany 's highest court ruled that a police practice of automatically scanning license plates to check them against a list of suspects violates the country 's constitution .
the court said the surveillance technique was too broad and allowed authorities to do things such as profile an individual 's movements . following a european model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chertoff said the deal includes " robust privacy protection " the deal is modeled on the pruem treaty signed by seven european union countries including germany in 2005 .

the treaty allows law enforcement in signatory countries to compare and exchange data more easily . the us is in preliminary talks with other countries on similar bilateral agreements . " this is a wonderful model , " mukasey said .

except in the bloc 's relations with latin america , where he can take a lead role . it was deja-vu in spain on sunday , march 9 . socialist party leader jose luis zapatero , 47 , was reelected in an election with high voter turnout that was close to the record participation levels of 75 percent back in 2004 .
he had also scored a second victory over the same conservative opponent , mariano rajoy . there had even been a terrorist attack days before the election , when isaias carrasco , a municipal socialist legislator was shot dead , allegedly by basque separatists .
exactly four years ago , on march 11 , islamic terror attacks on madrid 's commuter trains had killed 191 people , and were followed by an election that had shocked spanish voters into ousting the incumbent right of center people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- in favor of the relatively unknown zapatero . virtually all spaniards agree that had 11-m , which is spanish shorthand for the madrid attacks , not occurred days before the 2004 elections , zapatero would not be serving two terms today . reversed us relationship in his first term , zapatero had taken spain in a radically different direction from his pp predecessor , jose maria aznar , especially in foreign policy .
aznar had been closely allied with us president george w. bush and had involved spain in the iraq war , which was opposed by 90 percent of spaniards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's aznar -lrb- center -rrb- and britain 's blair -lrb- left -rrb- had a privileged partnership with bush zapatero immediately reversed aznar 's policy and realigned spain with the france and germany in terms of the iraq war .
he fulfilled his campaign pledge of unilaterally withdrawing spanish troops from an international brigade - a move that angered the bush administration and sent us-spain relations on a downward spiral .

except in the bloc 's relations with latin america , where he can take a lead role . it was deja-vu in spain on sunday , march 9 . socialist party leader jose luis zapatero , 47 , was reelected in an election with high voter turnout that was close to the record participation levels of 75 percent back in 2004 .
he had also scored a second victory over the same conservative opponent , mariano rajoy . there had even been a terrorist attack days before the election , when isaias carrasco , a municipal socialist legislator was shot dead , allegedly by basque separatists .
exactly four years ago , on march 11 , islamic terror attacks on madrid 's commuter trains had killed 191 people , and were followed by an election that had shocked spanish voters into ousting the incumbent right of center people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- in favor of the relatively unknown zapatero . virtually all spaniards agree that had 11-m , which is spanish shorthand for the madrid attacks , not occurred days before the 2004 elections , zapatero would not be serving two terms today . reversed us relationship in his first term , zapatero had taken spain in a radically different direction from his pp predecessor , jose maria aznar , especially in foreign policy .
aznar had been closely allied with us president george w. bush and had involved spain in the iraq war , which was opposed by 90 percent of spaniards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's aznar -lrb- center -rrb- and britain 's blair -lrb- left -rrb- had a privileged partnership with bush zapatero immediately reversed aznar 's policy and realigned spain with the france and germany in terms of the iraq war .
he fulfilled his campaign pledge of unilaterally withdrawing spanish troops from an international brigade - a move that angered the bush administration and sent us-spain relations on a downward spiral . " bush had been a convenient cover for expressing an ideological antipathy towards the us , " said soeren kern , a german fellow for transatlantic relations at the strategic studies group -lrb- gees -rrb- in madrid .
" even many socialists believe that zapatero has taken spain too far to the left . " zapatero grew up with a hard-core leftist ideology , so it is not just a matter of being anti-bush , but anti-hypercapitalist america , " he added . no need to rsvp zapatero has never been invited to the white house and even when us secretary of state condoleezza rice paid a courtesy call to madrid last year , policy differences on cuba were a bone of contention . spain , which maintains business interests with havana , wants to engage the communist dictatorship in a dialogue , whereas rice had chided her counterpart , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , for not doing enough to support human rights on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and spain could work to end cuba 's isolation now that castro has stepped down " it will take a new us president in 2009 to restore bilateral relations , " said antonio garrigues walker , honorary president of the spain-us council in madrid .
he emphasized that commercial and cultural exchanges are thriving in spite of the personal animosity between zapatero and bush . common ground in latin america garrigues pointed out that spain has become the fourth-largest foreign investor in the us , after canada , the uk and the netherlands , with much of its financial resources going into hispanic-owned businesses .
the spanish-speaking community is the fastest growing ethnic group in the us . he added that both countries can also find common ground in latin america , where spain has always had strong historical and linguistic ties to its former colonies .
and now that fidel castro has stepped down after nearly 50 years in power , they could even work constructively together to end cuba 's isolation . spain leads eu in latin america , north africa latin america is where spain could lead the european union in foreign policy , according to guenther maihold , a specialist in iberian and latin american affairs at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
zapatero 's policy of engagement in cuba , in particular , could be beneficial for both europe and the us . " another region where spain is influential is north africa , " said maihold , who explained that zapatero has actively sought an eu-wide solution to stem the flow of african migration to europe , which has been particularly problematic for countries on the mediterranean rim . maihold added that zapatero 's consensual approach to foreign policy has worked well for the european union .
unlike aznar , who had tried to elevate spain 's international profile by regular meetings with bush and then british prime minister tony blair , zapatero has generally has been content to take a backseat in the 27-nation bloc , letting france , germany and britain lead the eu . multilateral approach in foreign affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is concerned kosovar secession will encourage militant basques to declare independence other than in kosovo , where spain has come out against recognizing the former serbian province 's independence , madrid is content to let brussels take the driver 's seat in foreign policy issues , according to tom burns maranon , a news commentator and corporate strategist at madrid-based eurocofin . " zapatero is not interested in creating a spanish agenda in foreign affairs , but is keen on working within a multinational framework , " he said . the premier is concerned that kosovo 's recent secession from serbia could encourage spain 's own militant basque movement to declare independence unilaterally , maranon explained . experts disagree , however , on whether domestic or foreign affairs will be the focus of zapatero 's second term .
although over the last ten years spain has experienced unprecedented growth rates that have been largely fuelled by a construction boom , the economy has been slowing down due to the international credit crunch , maranon said .

washington said it hopes the groundbreaking deal will serve as a model for cooperation with other countries . under the new information sharing agreement , us and german law enforcement officials will have immediate , albeit partial , access to each other 's fingerprint and dna databases . the move will allow authorities to check within minutes if a database contains a suspected terrorist 's personal information .
should a match be found , authorities would then have to submit a request for more detailed information . the effort will speed up the exchange of information and help in the terrorist fight , said german and us officials who met in berlin to launch the bilateral agreement on tuesday , march 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal between berlin and washington could be a model for other bilateral agreements us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and us attorney general michael mukasey travelled to berlin to meet with german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries .
the deal will need german parliamentary ratification before becoming law , which schaeuble said he hopes will happen by the end of 2008 . " it is imperative as peace-loving nations we continue to work together to counter the threat of terrorism and to cooperate in this effort using every tool at our disposal , " chertoff said . a direct " hit " the cooperation includes a " hit / no-hit " procedure whereby a country can access another country 's national dna and fingerprint database and determine whether it contains a terror suspect 's data .
if a " hit " occurs , a formal application can be made for further information . " there is no automated exchange of information as such , but only an automated exchange of information on whether there is information available or not , " schaeuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much information should be shared ?
the exception is dna files , which are not allowed to be automatically shared under us law , schaeuble said . but the plan still raises privacy concerns , germany 's independent privacy commissioner peter schaar said on german public radio deutschlandfunk . schaar gave the example of a protestor who is fingerprinted by german police .
the information might be important to german officials , " but does that give the right to the united states , when i travel there and maybe have the wrong stamp in my passport , to get access to this data ?
i would say no , " schaar said . erosion of civil liberties ? zypries said she was not concerned that the agreement would erode civil liberties . " the data that is transferred can only be used in areas covered by the agreement and not for example as evidence in ongoing criminal cases , " zypries said at the joint news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians have called for greater cooperation " we have ensured that there is an obligation that automated requests for information and replies are recorded ... and , of course , there is an obligation for the data to be destroyed " if it is not used , she said . privacy has become a major issue in germany in recent years , with law enforcement agencies claiming they need more latitude to do their jobs .
while courts have granted partial victories to those who advocate for more electronic surveillance , there 's a sense that courts are sensitive to rights issues . on tuesday , germany 's highest court ruled that a police practice of automatically scanning license plates to check them against a list of suspects violates the country 's constitution .
the court said the surveillance technique was too broad and allowed authorities to do things such as profile an individual 's movements . following a european model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chertoff said the deal includes " robust privacy protection " the deal is modeled on the pruem treaty signed by seven european union countries including germany in 2005 .
the treaty was drawn up following train bombings in madrid by islamist radicals in 2004 which killed 191 people .
the treaty allows law enforcement in signatory countries to compare and exchange data more easily . the us is in preliminary talks with other countries on similar bilateral agreements . " this is a wonderful model , " mukasey said .
" i hope others will follow shortly . " chertoff added that europe and the us needed to cooperate in their efforts fighting international terrorism . " we are indeed fighting a networked , international enemy and , therefore , we have to respond with global networks of our own , " chertoff said .
" today 's agreement between the united states and germany reinforces our collective commitment to combat global terrorism while ensuring robust privacy protection . " germany has n't suffered a major attack the deal comes six months after german authorities made three arrests in an alleged plot to attack us interests and citizens in germany .
us intelligence had passed on information to berlin on the plan . two of the men arrested in september were german converts to islam and a third was turkish .
all had gone to pakistan for training and were stockpiling chemicals to make car bombs .
among the targets were us military installations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the start of 2008 , many german soccer experts picked hertha to be relegated .
but after a five-game undefeated streak , things are looking up in berlin .
that 's partly down to the work of their swiss coach , lucien favre . even hardcore hertha fans have trouble identifying all the players on the field these days - but that does n't mean they 're unhappy . after falling perilously close to the relegation zone , berlin has earned three wins and two draws in their last five matches , creating a comfortable cushion between themselves and the second division . what 's more , the team is playing arguably their most attacking , attractive soccer since 2000 , when berlin competed in the champions league . when hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness brought in swiss coach lucien favre in the off-season , he announced that 2007/08 would be a transitional year .
that was no exaggeration . gone are brazilian stars like gilberto and marcelinho , as well as problematic young talents such as kevin-prince boateng and ashkan dejagah .
taking their place are decidedly unfamiliar names like rudolf skacel and gojko kacar . so what are the reasons for hertha 's minor renaissance ? from cheese to clockwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre was hired in 2007 to re-route a team headed nowhere one major factor is that lucien favre has put his stamp on a squad often dismissed as uncoachable . favre - an extremely gifted soccer player whose own career was cut short by injury - favors what he calls " polyvalent " players .
what he means primarily are defensively solid midfielders who can advance the ball with one-touch passing . the formula definitely worked at favre 's previous club , fc zurich - they won two swiss league titles . the most obvious benefit of this philosophy for berlin has been defensive stability .
hertha conceded 55 goals in 34 bundesliga games in the 2007 calendar year - whereas after six games in 2008 , they 've let in a mere five . favre has also proven willing to improvise , scrapping his preferred back four for a 3-2-3-1-1 formation to better utilize hertha 's current personnel . berlin 's defense , which had been reminiscent of swiss cheese , is now working with some much-needed clockmaker 's precision . green but game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a revamped hertha squad beat defending champs stuttgart in february on the offensive end , hertha 's improvement under favre is n't as noticeable in the statistics . that 's partially due to the fact that hertha are fielding a young squad .
in their most recent match against dortmund , seven players out of the starting 11 were under the age of 25 . favre 's youngsters often lose their nerve when trying to make a precision last pass or convert opportunities .
in both of their draws this year , hertha were the stronger side and could have won with better finishing . on the plus side , the generational conflict that has plagued berlin in the last few seasons appears to have been laid to rest .
the youngsters respect the veterans ' authority , and experienced players have accepted a seat on the bench without much complaint . " if the players have an intelligence for the game , hierarchy is not a problem , " favre told dw-tv . berlin 's success rate with transfers has also improved since favre got involved .
in addition to skacel and kacar , striker raffael , midfielder fabian lustenberger and defender steve von bergen have all proved worthwhile additions to the squad . " you have to study a player very closely , " favre said .
" and if you make a mistake , you have a player under contract for two , three or even four years .

political ideology was their main motivation , both in east and west germany . around 189,000 people were informers the secret police of the gdr 's communist regime , when the berlin wall fell in 1989 - that 's according to thuringia 's state office for researching east germany 's stasi on monday , march 10 . previously , the number of stasi informers in 1989 had been estimated at 174,000 .
the complete report , by historian helmut mueller-enberg , is to be published on thursday . the stasi relied heavily on ordinary people to report activity that deviated from the official political ideology in the country of 16 million .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 11.03.2008 swiss coach gradually reviving hertha berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how long can the happiness at hertha last ?
at the start of 2008 , many german soccer experts picked hertha to be relegated .
but after a five-game undefeated streak , things are looking up in berlin .
that 's partly down to the work of their swiss coach , lucien favre . even hardcore hertha fans have trouble identifying all the players on the field these days - but that does n't mean they 're unhappy . after falling perilously close to the relegation zone , berlin has earned three wins and two draws in their last five matches , creating a comfortable cushion between themselves and the second division . what 's more , the team is playing arguably their most attacking , attractive soccer since 2000 , when berlin competed in the champions league . when hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness brought in swiss coach lucien favre in the off-season , he announced that 2007/08 would be a transitional year .
that was no exaggeration . gone are brazilian stars like gilberto and marcelinho , as well as problematic young talents such as kevin-prince boateng and ashkan dejagah .
taking their place are decidedly unfamiliar names like rudolf skacel and gojko kacar . so what are the reasons for hertha 's minor renaissance ? from cheese to clockwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre was hired in 2007 to re-route a team headed nowhere one major factor is that lucien favre has put his stamp on a squad often dismissed as uncoachable . favre - an extremely gifted soccer player whose own career was cut short by injury - favors what he calls " polyvalent " players .
what he means primarily are defensively solid midfielders who can advance the ball with one-touch passing . the formula definitely worked at favre 's previous club , fc zurich - they won two swiss league titles . the most obvious benefit of this philosophy for berlin has been defensive stability .
hertha conceded 55 goals in 34 bundesliga games in the 2007 calendar year - whereas after six games in 2008 , they 've let in a mere five . favre has also proven willing to improvise , scrapping his preferred back four for a 3-2-3-1-1 formation to better utilize hertha 's current personnel . berlin 's defense , which had been reminiscent of swiss cheese , is now working with some much-needed clockmaker 's precision . green but game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a revamped hertha squad beat defending champs stuttgart in february on the offensive end , hertha 's improvement under favre is n't as noticeable in the statistics . that 's partially due to the fact that hertha are fielding a young squad .
in their most recent match against dortmund , seven players out of the starting 11 were under the age of 25 . favre 's youngsters often lose their nerve when trying to make a precision last pass or convert opportunities .
in both of their draws this year , hertha were the stronger side and could have won with better finishing . on the plus side , the generational conflict that has plagued berlin in the last few seasons appears to have been laid to rest .
the youngsters respect the veterans ' authority , and experienced players have accepted a seat on the bench without much complaint . " if the players have an intelligence for the game , hierarchy is not a problem , " favre told dw-tv . berlin 's success rate with transfers has also improved since favre got involved .
in addition to skacel and kacar , striker raffael , midfielder fabian lustenberger and defender steve von bergen have all proved worthwhile additions to the squad . " you have to study a player very closely , " favre said .
" and if you make a mistake , you have a player under contract for two , three or even four years .
that 's expensive and creates a problem .
especially for the coach . " the pantelic situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marko pantelic - will he stay or will he go now ?
rarely has the mood been more harmonious at hertha .
indeed the only serious point of friction , for the moment , is between favre and hertha 's top performer , forward marko pantelic . the serbian striker has scored 11 goals this season , but berlin 's tabloids have repeatedly reported that favre considers pantelic too egotistic and would like to ship him off the coach is at pains to deny that . " if you want to get to the top , you have to emphasize the positive , " favre said .
" pantelic is trying hard to improve and play the sort of game i want . " nonetheless , should hertha , still burdened by millions in debt , be offered a hefty transfer fee for the serb , they might be tempted to take the money and extend favre 's rebuilding experiment . dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off , which airs thursday , march 13 , features an extensive interview with hertha coach lucien favre . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the start of 2008 , many german soccer experts picked hertha to be relegated .
but after a five-game undefeated streak , things are looking up in berlin .
that 's partly down to the work of their swiss coach , lucien favre . even hardcore hertha fans have trouble identifying all the players on the field these days - but that does n't mean they 're unhappy . after falling perilously close to the relegation zone , berlin has earned three wins and two draws in their last five matches , creating a comfortable cushion between themselves and the second division . what 's more , the team is playing arguably their most attacking , attractive soccer since 2000 , when berlin competed in the champions league . when hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness brought in swiss coach lucien favre in the off-season , he announced that 2007/08 would be a transitional year .
that was no exaggeration . gone are brazilian stars like gilberto and marcelinho , as well as problematic young talents such as kevin-prince boateng and ashkan dejagah .
taking their place are decidedly unfamiliar names like rudolf skacel and gojko kacar . so what are the reasons for hertha 's minor renaissance ? from cheese to clockwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre was hired in 2007 to re-route a team headed nowhere one major factor is that lucien favre has put his stamp on a squad often dismissed as uncoachable . favre - an extremely gifted soccer player whose own career was cut short by injury - favors what he calls " polyvalent " players .
what he means primarily are defensively solid midfielders who can advance the ball with one-touch passing . the formula definitely worked at favre 's previous club , fc zurich - they won two swiss league titles . the most obvious benefit of this philosophy for berlin has been defensive stability .
hertha conceded 55 goals in 34 bundesliga games in the 2007 calendar year - whereas after six games in 2008 , they 've let in a mere five . favre has also proven willing to improvise , scrapping his preferred back four for a 3-2-3-1-1 formation to better utilize hertha 's current personnel . berlin 's defense , which had been reminiscent of swiss cheese , is now working with some much-needed clockmaker 's precision . green but game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a revamped hertha squad beat defending champs stuttgart in february on the offensive end , hertha 's improvement under favre is n't as noticeable in the statistics . that 's partially due to the fact that hertha are fielding a young squad .
in their most recent match against dortmund , seven players out of the starting 11 were under the age of 25 . favre 's youngsters often lose their nerve when trying to make a precision last pass or convert opportunities .
in both of their draws this year , hertha were the stronger side and could have won with better finishing . on the plus side , the generational conflict that has plagued berlin in the last few seasons appears to have been laid to rest .
the youngsters respect the veterans ' authority , and experienced players have accepted a seat on the bench without much complaint . " if the players have an intelligence for the game , hierarchy is not a problem , " favre told dw-tv . berlin 's success rate with transfers has also improved since favre got involved .
in addition to skacel and kacar , striker raffael , midfielder fabian lustenberger and defender steve von bergen have all proved worthwhile additions to the squad . " you have to study a player very closely , " favre said .
" and if you make a mistake , you have a player under contract for two , three or even four years .
that 's expensive and creates a problem .
especially for the coach . " the pantelic situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marko pantelic - will he stay or will he go now ?

indeed the only serious point of friction , for the moment , is between favre and hertha 's top performer , forward marko pantelic . the serbian striker has scored 11 goals this season , but berlin 's tabloids have repeatedly reported that favre considers pantelic too egotistic and would like to ship him off the coach is at pains to deny that . " if you want to get to the top , you have to emphasize the positive , " favre said .
" pantelic is trying hard to improve and play the sort of game i want .

at the start of 2008 , many german soccer experts picked hertha to be relegated .
but after a five-game undefeated streak , things are looking up in berlin .
that 's partly down to the work of their swiss coach , lucien favre . even hardcore hertha fans have trouble identifying all the players on the field these days - but that does n't mean they 're unhappy . after falling perilously close to the relegation zone , berlin has earned three wins and two draws in their last five matches , creating a comfortable cushion between themselves and the second division . what 's more , the team is playing arguably their most attacking , attractive soccer since 2000 , when berlin competed in the champions league . when hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness brought in swiss coach lucien favre in the off-season , he announced that 2007/08 would be a transitional year .
that was no exaggeration . gone are brazilian stars like gilberto and marcelinho , as well as problematic young talents such as kevin-prince boateng and ashkan dejagah .
taking their place are decidedly unfamiliar names like rudolf skacel and gojko kacar . so what are the reasons for hertha 's minor renaissance ? from cheese to clockwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre was hired in 2007 to re-route a team headed nowhere one major factor is that lucien favre has put his stamp on a squad often dismissed as uncoachable . favre - an extremely gifted soccer player whose own career was cut short by injury - favors what he calls " polyvalent " players .
what he means primarily are defensively solid midfielders who can advance the ball with one-touch passing . the formula definitely worked at favre 's previous club , fc zurich - they won two swiss league titles . the most obvious benefit of this philosophy for berlin has been defensive stability .
hertha conceded 55 goals in 34 bundesliga games in the 2007 calendar year - whereas after six games in 2008 , they 've let in a mere five . favre has also proven willing to improvise , scrapping his preferred back four for a 3-2-3-1-1 formation to better utilize hertha 's current personnel . berlin 's defense , which had been reminiscent of swiss cheese , is now working with some much-needed clockmaker 's precision . green but game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a revamped hertha squad beat defending champs stuttgart in february on the offensive end , hertha 's improvement under favre is n't as noticeable in the statistics . that 's partially due to the fact that hertha are fielding a young squad .
in their most recent match against dortmund , seven players out of the starting 11 were under the age of 25 . favre 's youngsters often lose their nerve when trying to make a precision last pass or convert opportunities .
in both of their draws this year , hertha were the stronger side and could have won with better finishing . on the plus side , the generational conflict that has plagued berlin in the last few seasons appears to have been laid to rest .
the youngsters respect the veterans ' authority , and experienced players have accepted a seat on the bench without much complaint . " if the players have an intelligence for the game , hierarchy is not a problem , " favre told dw-tv . berlin 's success rate with transfers has also improved since favre got involved .
in addition to skacel and kacar , striker raffael , midfielder fabian lustenberger and defender steve von bergen have all proved worthwhile additions to the squad . " you have to study a player very closely , " favre said .
" and if you make a mistake , you have a player under contract for two , three or even four years .
that 's expensive and creates a problem .
especially for the coach . " the pantelic situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marko pantelic - will he stay or will he go now ?
rarely has the mood been more harmonious at hertha .
indeed the only serious point of friction , for the moment , is between favre and hertha 's top performer , forward marko pantelic . the serbian striker has scored 11 goals this season , but berlin 's tabloids have repeatedly reported that favre considers pantelic too egotistic and would like to ship him off the coach is at pains to deny that . " if you want to get to the top , you have to emphasize the positive , " favre said .
" pantelic is trying hard to improve and play the sort of game i want . " nonetheless , should hertha , still burdened by millions in debt , be offered a hefty transfer fee for the serb , they might be tempted to take the money and extend favre 's rebuilding experiment . dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off , which airs thursday , march 13 , features an extensive interview with hertha coach lucien favre . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washington said it hopes the groundbreaking deal will serve as a model for cooperation with other countries . under the new information sharing agreement , us and german law enforcement officials will have immediate , albeit partial , access to each other 's fingerprint and dna databases . the move will allow authorities to check within minutes if a database contains a suspected terrorist 's personal information .
should a match be found , authorities would then have to submit a request for more detailed information . the effort will speed up the exchange of information and help in the terrorist fight , said german and us officials who met in berlin to launch the bilateral agreement on tuesday , march 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal between berlin and washington could be a model for other bilateral agreements us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and us attorney general michael mukasey travelled to berlin to meet with german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries .
the deal will need german parliamentary ratification before becoming law , which schaeuble said he hopes will happen by the end of 2008 . " it is imperative as peace-loving nations we continue to work together to counter the threat of terrorism and to cooperate in this effort using every tool at our disposal , " chertoff said . a direct " hit " the cooperation includes a " hit / no-hit " procedure whereby a country can access another country 's national dna and fingerprint database and determine whether it contains a terror suspect 's data .
if a " hit " occurs , a formal application can be made for further information . " there is no automated exchange of information as such , but only an automated exchange of information on whether there is information available or not , " schaeuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much information should be shared ?
the exception is dna files , which are not allowed to be automatically shared under us law , schaeuble said . but the plan still raises privacy concerns , germany 's independent privacy commissioner peter schaar said on german public radio deutschlandfunk . schaar gave the example of a protestor who is fingerprinted by german police .
the information might be important to german officials , " but does that give the right to the united states , when i travel there and maybe have the wrong stamp in my passport , to get access to this data ?
i would say no , " schaar said . erosion of civil liberties ? zypries said she was not concerned that the agreement would erode civil liberties . " the data that is transferred can only be used in areas covered by the agreement and not for example as evidence in ongoing criminal cases , " zypries said at the joint news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians have called for greater cooperation " we have ensured that there is an obligation that automated requests for information and replies are recorded ... and , of course , there is an obligation for the data to be destroyed " if it is not used , she said . privacy has become a major issue in germany in recent years , with law enforcement agencies claiming they need more latitude to do their jobs .
while courts have granted partial victories to those who advocate for more electronic surveillance , there 's a sense that courts are sensitive to rights issues . on tuesday , germany 's highest court ruled that a police practice of automatically scanning license plates to check them against a list of suspects violates the country 's constitution .
the court said the surveillance technique was too broad and allowed authorities to do things such as profile an individual 's movements . following a european model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chertoff said the deal includes " robust privacy protection " the deal is modeled on the pruem treaty signed by seven european union countries including germany in 2005 .
the treaty was drawn up following train bombings in madrid by islamist radicals in 2004 which killed 191 people .
the treaty allows law enforcement in signatory countries to compare and exchange data more easily . the us is in preliminary talks with other countries on similar bilateral agreements . " this is a wonderful model , " mukasey said .
" i hope others will follow shortly . " chertoff added that europe and the us needed to cooperate in their efforts fighting international terrorism . " we are indeed fighting a networked , international enemy and , therefore , we have to respond with global networks of our own , " chertoff said .

though the imbalance could hurt the economy , some investors apparently see blue skies ahead . the euro 's rise on foreign exchange markets could endanger economic growth in the euro zone , the european union 's slovenian presidency said on tuesday , march 11 , as the euro hit a record high just shy of $ 1.55 . " of course this is a problem that we are witnessing on a daily basis , " slovenia 's finance minister andrej bajuk said in an internet broadcast .
" we have come to the conclusion that these movements may not have a positive effect when it comes to economic growth and development . " the value of the euro , the currency in 15 european countries , has continued to climb as experts say the us economy slips toward a recession . " we believe that exchange rates should ... reflect the realities of the economy , " bajuk said .
" we also believe the foundations of the european economy are solid and wholesome . " the european central bank chief jean-claude trichet had on monday said he was " concerned by the excessive exchange rate fluctuations . "
the eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia also said currency markets were among his key concerns . " the excessive volatility indeed is a matter of concern , " he told journalists on monday . german economy to survive turmoil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking up , some economists say tuesday 's jump followed the announcement of better-than-expected investor sentiment in germany . " experts are more optimistic for the growth of the us economy in the next six months , " the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said in a statement accompanying its monthly report .
" moreover , they expect the dollar to appreciate versus the euro .
this should benefit export-oriented sectors of the german economy . " zew 's economic indicator for germany rose 7.5 points in march to minus 32.0 points after plummeting to minus 39.5 in february , the lowest point since january 1993 .
economists had predicted it would drop to below minus 40 points . " the optimism of the financial analysts is presumably based on the hope that the peak of the financial market crisis will be overcome in half a year and that business dynamics will not weaken more strongly than expected to date , " zew president wolfgang franz said upon the report 's release . though the financial experts surveyed seem to feel good about the near future , they gave a more negative assessment of the current situation in germany .
that indicator dropped by 1.6 points to 32.1 points due to the country 's weak economic growth figures . interest rates to remain stable , exports rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro has continued to reach new highs against the dollar the euro 's leap to nearly $ 1.55 also followed statements tuesday by axel weber , head of germany 's central bank , and a member of the european central bank 's rate-setting council , who ruled out a drop in interest rates . a high euro serves as a double-edged sword for the euro-zone economies .
while essential imports like oil , which is typically priced in dollars , become cheaper , its exports become more expensive abroad , making them less competitive on the global market . since the euro has been on the rise , germany has continued running up large trade surpluses .
according to data released monday , german exports rose by a larger-than-predicted 3.8 percent in january . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

months of debate over the transport fees that deutsche bahn is charging a traveling holocaust memorial escalated when a jewish community leader called bahn chief hartmut mehdorn " a nazi at heart . " " if mehdorn had held the same position in the third reich he would have arranged the deportation of jews with great conviction , " michael szentei-heise , a jewish community leader said at the opening of the zug der erinnerung , or train of commemoration , exhibition in dusseldorf on sunday , march 9 . the german state railway company responded with a statement tuesday that it was considering legal action . " the remarks are unforgivable and we will ask our lawyers to look into the matter , " the statement said . taxing the train of commemoration the disagreement further escalated tension over transport fees that deutsche bahn is charging the train of commemoration exhibit , for the use of its rails and stations .
housed in a series of old railway cars , the traveling exhibit is set to visit 15 cities before arriving at auschwitz in may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims were often brought by train to nazi death camps initially , deutsche bahn had refused to host the exhibition in its stations , saying that the difficult subject matter , which traces the plight of the 11,400 jewish children who were deported from france to auschwitz between 1942 and 1944 , deserved more than the divided attention of hurried commuters . after drawing sharp criticism for their stance , however , the rail company relented and instead had to charge the exhibition organizers fees that , according to szentei-heise , total of " a laughable 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 166,000 -rrb- .

" but we are obligated by law to collect fees . " referring to mehdorn as the " head of the new reichsbahn , " szentei-heise used rhetoric that harkens back to the nazi era .
the reichsbahn , the wartime predecessor to deutsche bahn , received 25 reichsmarks , or about 25 euros for each child it transported to the camp . the zug der erinnerung leaves dusseldorf for cologne on march 13 and will stop in an additional 14 stations throughout germany before closing at the auschwitz memorial in may . number of survivors falling the debate continued on the same day german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned tuesday against allowing memories of the holocaust to fade as the number of survivors of one of the darkest periods in european history dwindles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 11.03.2008 berlin launches image campaign with new slogan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be partying - berlin is fun regardless of its slogan " be berlin " - that 's the message the german capital wants to project to the world .
the catchphrase is part of a major publicity drive , but some people are asking : what would it mean to be berlin ? be successful berlin mayor klaus wowereit officially launched the slogan on tuesday , march 11 , as part of a 10.6 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- marketing initiative to encourage tourism and enhance the city 's image .
" with the branding campaign , the berlin senate wants to project berlin 's image outside the city , " woworeit said at the launch , " so that more people come visit us , more companies create new jobs here , and scientific , cultural and social richness of the city becomes easier to experience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be mayorial - wowereit 's previous phrase for berlin was " poor but sexy " the catchphrase vaguely echoes john f. kennedy 's " ich bin ein berliner " speech during the cold war and follows in the trend of cities using advertising slogans to brand themselves .
probably the most famous example is the " i love new york " campaign of the late 1970s .
more recently , the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg landed a hit with the slogan " we can do everything but speak proper german . "
berlin is germany 's top destination for tourists , attracting more than 8 million visitors and earning between 8 and 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12-14.5 billion -rrb- from them annually .
that 's a business berlin wants to expand .
be stranded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be building - construction sites are still all over the capital but the catchphrase has left many people scratching their heads as to what precisely one would be , if one were to choose to " be berlin " - all the more so since the debt-ridden capital is known just as much for being chaotic as it is for being creative .
" all berlin residents should be warned … that the imperative is meant literally , " wrote berlin columnist harald martenstein ahead of the official launch .
" when the first ' be berlin ' billboards are erected and the entire city populace stops bathing , quits their jobs and throws all their money out the window , saying that the berlin senate told them to do so , we 'll see we 've shot ourselves in the foot . "
indeed , tourists currently visiting berlin are getting a taste for just how disorderly the german capital can be .
the city 's public-transport workers are currently on strike , closing down the vast majority of subways , streetcars and busses and leaving visitors and natives alike to get around the huge metropolis as best they can .
be sarcastic bildunterschrift : be fluffy - some say knut could have come up with a better idea and berliners themselves - at least to judge from the blogs - seem underwhelmed by the campaign , greeting it with their characteristic sarcasm .
some have scoffed that the slogan sounds like a stutter .
others have quipped that a better catchphrase would be " bi berlin , " playing on the city 's tradition of tolerance .
a few berliners have complained that the campaign is in english , not german .
and a great many have speculated about how much the perennially cash-strapped capital paid for the three syllables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be broke - berlin 's debts have meant cuts in services like education " what did those two words cost ? " asked one blogger on the online page of the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" i can only shake my head . "
black humor was another response .
" the money has to be gotten rid of , " wrote a blogger on a page devoted to the capital .
" if it 's left lying around , someone will trip over it .
it 's better to spend it immediately .
then it 's out of the way , and everything 's hunky-dory . "
and with berlin already well known internationally for its nightlife and culture , it 's debatable whether the city really needed help on this score from pr experts .

the catchphrase is part of a major publicity drive , but some people are asking : what would it mean to be berlin ? be successful berlin mayor klaus wowereit officially launched the slogan on tuesday , march 11 , as part of a 10.6 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- marketing initiative to encourage tourism and enhance the city 's image .
" with the branding campaign , the berlin senate wants to project berlin 's image outside the city , " woworeit said at the launch , " so that more people come visit us , more companies create new jobs here , and scientific , cultural and social richness of the city becomes easier to experience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be mayorial - wowereit 's previous phrase for berlin was " poor but sexy " the catchphrase vaguely echoes john f. kennedy 's " ich bin ein berliner " speech during the cold war and follows in the trend of cities using advertising slogans to brand themselves .
probably the most famous example is the " i love new york " campaign of the late 1970s .
more recently , the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg landed a hit with the slogan " we can do everything but speak proper german . "
berlin is germany 's top destination for tourists , attracting more than 8 million visitors and earning between 8 and 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12-14.5 billion -rrb- from them annually .
that 's a business berlin wants to expand .
be stranded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be building - construction sites are still all over the capital but the catchphrase has left many people scratching their heads as to what precisely one would be , if one were to choose to " be berlin " - all the more so since the debt-ridden capital is known just as much for being chaotic as it is for being creative .
" all berlin residents should be warned … that the imperative is meant literally , " wrote berlin columnist harald martenstein ahead of the official launch .
" when the first ' be berlin ' billboards are erected and the entire city populace stops bathing , quits their jobs and throws all their money out the window , saying that the berlin senate told them to do so , we 'll see we 've shot ourselves in the foot . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 11.03.2008 spain 's zapatero favors low profile in foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is usually willing to let brussels lead when it comes to foreign policy decisions reelected in circumstances similar to in 2004 , zapatero will likely demure to the eu when it comes to international politics .
except in the bloc 's relations with latin america , where he can take a lead role . it was deja-vu in spain on sunday , march 9 . socialist party leader jose luis zapatero , 47 , was reelected in an election with high voter turnout that was close to the record participation levels of 75 percent back in 2004 .
he had also scored a second victory over the same conservative opponent , mariano rajoy . there had even been a terrorist attack days before the election , when isaias carrasco , a municipal socialist legislator was shot dead , allegedly by basque separatists .
exactly four years ago , on march 11 , islamic terror attacks on madrid 's commuter trains had killed 191 people , and were followed by an election that had shocked spanish voters into ousting the incumbent right of center people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- in favor of the relatively unknown zapatero . virtually all spaniards agree that had 11-m , which is spanish shorthand for the madrid attacks , not occurred days before the 2004 elections , zapatero would not be serving two terms today . reversed us relationship in his first term , zapatero had taken spain in a radically different direction from his pp predecessor , jose maria aznar , especially in foreign policy .
aznar had been closely allied with us president george w. bush and had involved spain in the iraq war , which was opposed by 90 percent of spaniards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's aznar -lrb- center -rrb- and britain 's blair -lrb- left -rrb- had a privileged partnership with bush zapatero immediately reversed aznar 's policy and realigned spain with the france and germany in terms of the iraq war .
he fulfilled his campaign pledge of unilaterally withdrawing spanish troops from an international brigade - a move that angered the bush administration and sent us-spain relations on a downward spiral . " bush had been a convenient cover for expressing an ideological antipathy towards the us , " said soeren kern , a german fellow for transatlantic relations at the strategic studies group -lrb- gees -rrb- in madrid .
" even many socialists believe that zapatero has taken spain too far to the left . " zapatero grew up with a hard-core leftist ideology , so it is not just a matter of being anti-bush , but anti-hypercapitalist america , " he added . no need to rsvp zapatero has never been invited to the white house and even when us secretary of state condoleezza rice paid a courtesy call to madrid last year , policy differences on cuba were a bone of contention . spain , which maintains business interests with havana , wants to engage the communist dictatorship in a dialogue , whereas rice had chided her counterpart , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , for not doing enough to support human rights on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and spain could work to end cuba 's isolation now that castro has stepped down " it will take a new us president in 2009 to restore bilateral relations , " said antonio garrigues walker , honorary president of the spain-us council in madrid .
he emphasized that commercial and cultural exchanges are thriving in spite of the personal animosity between zapatero and bush . common ground in latin america garrigues pointed out that spain has become the fourth-largest foreign investor in the us , after canada , the uk and the netherlands , with much of its financial resources going into hispanic-owned businesses .
the spanish-speaking community is the fastest growing ethnic group in the us . he added that both countries can also find common ground in latin america , where spain has always had strong historical and linguistic ties to its former colonies .
and now that fidel castro has stepped down after nearly 50 years in power , they could even work constructively together to end cuba 's isolation . spain leads eu in latin america , north africa latin america is where spain could lead the european union in foreign policy , according to guenther maihold , a specialist in iberian and latin american affairs at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
zapatero 's policy of engagement in cuba , in particular , could be beneficial for both europe and the us . " another region where spain is influential is north africa , " said maihold , who explained that zapatero has actively sought an eu-wide solution to stem the flow of african migration to europe , which has been particularly problematic for countries on the mediterranean rim . maihold added that zapatero 's consensual approach to foreign policy has worked well for the european union .
unlike aznar , who had tried to elevate spain 's international profile by regular meetings with bush and then british prime minister tony blair , zapatero has generally has been content to take a backseat in the 27-nation bloc , letting france , germany and britain lead the eu . multilateral approach in foreign affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is concerned kosovar secession will encourage militant basques to declare independence other than in kosovo , where spain has come out against recognizing the former serbian province 's independence , madrid is content to let brussels take the driver 's seat in foreign policy issues , according to tom burns maranon , a news commentator and corporate strategist at madrid-based eurocofin . " zapatero is not interested in creating a spanish agenda in foreign affairs , but is keen on working within a multinational framework , " he said . the premier is concerned that kosovo 's recent secession from serbia could encourage spain 's own militant basque movement to declare independence unilaterally , maranon explained . experts disagree , however , on whether domestic or foreign affairs will be the focus of zapatero 's second term .
although over the last ten years spain has experienced unprecedented growth rates that have been largely fuelled by a construction boom , the economy has been slowing down due to the international credit crunch , maranon said . " zapatero could even wind up devoting more time to foreign affairs to deflect from problems at home , " he said . kern of gees , however , said zapatero could become so consumed with the domestic economy that there would be little energy left to focus on spain 's international role . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

except in the bloc 's relations with latin america , where he can take a lead role . it was deja-vu in spain on sunday , march 9 . socialist party leader jose luis zapatero , 47 , was reelected in an election with high voter turnout that was close to the record participation levels of 75 percent back in 2004 .
he had also scored a second victory over the same conservative opponent , mariano rajoy . there had even been a terrorist attack days before the election , when isaias carrasco , a municipal socialist legislator was shot dead , allegedly by basque separatists .
exactly four years ago , on march 11 , islamic terror attacks on madrid 's commuter trains had killed 191 people , and were followed by an election that had shocked spanish voters into ousting the incumbent right of center people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- in favor of the relatively unknown zapatero . virtually all spaniards agree that had 11-m , which is spanish shorthand for the madrid attacks , not occurred days before the 2004 elections , zapatero would not be serving two terms today . reversed us relationship in his first term , zapatero had taken spain in a radically different direction from his pp predecessor , jose maria aznar , especially in foreign policy .
aznar had been closely allied with us president george w. bush and had involved spain in the iraq war , which was opposed by 90 percent of spaniards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's aznar -lrb- center -rrb- and britain 's blair -lrb- left -rrb- had a privileged partnership with bush zapatero immediately reversed aznar 's policy and realigned spain with the france and germany in terms of the iraq war .
he fulfilled his campaign pledge of unilaterally withdrawing spanish troops from an international brigade - a move that angered the bush administration and sent us-spain relations on a downward spiral . " bush had been a convenient cover for expressing an ideological antipathy towards the us , " said soeren kern , a german fellow for transatlantic relations at the strategic studies group -lrb- gees -rrb- in madrid .
" even many socialists believe that zapatero has taken spain too far to the left . " zapatero grew up with a hard-core leftist ideology , so it is not just a matter of being anti-bush , but anti-hypercapitalist america , " he added . no need to rsvp zapatero has never been invited to the white house and even when us secretary of state condoleezza rice paid a courtesy call to madrid last year , policy differences on cuba were a bone of contention . spain , which maintains business interests with havana , wants to engage the communist dictatorship in a dialogue , whereas rice had chided her counterpart , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , for not doing enough to support human rights on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and spain could work to end cuba 's isolation now that castro has stepped down " it will take a new us president in 2009 to restore bilateral relations , " said antonio garrigues walker , honorary president of the spain-us council in madrid .
he emphasized that commercial and cultural exchanges are thriving in spite of the personal animosity between zapatero and bush . common ground in latin america garrigues pointed out that spain has become the fourth-largest foreign investor in the us , after canada , the uk and the netherlands , with much of its financial resources going into hispanic-owned businesses .
the spanish-speaking community is the fastest growing ethnic group in the us . he added that both countries can also find common ground in latin america , where spain has always had strong historical and linguistic ties to its former colonies .
and now that fidel castro has stepped down after nearly 50 years in power , they could even work constructively together to end cuba 's isolation . spain leads eu in latin america , north africa latin america is where spain could lead the european union in foreign policy , according to guenther maihold , a specialist in iberian and latin american affairs at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
zapatero 's policy of engagement in cuba , in particular , could be beneficial for both europe and the us . " another region where spain is influential is north africa , " said maihold , who explained that zapatero has actively sought an eu-wide solution to stem the flow of african migration to europe , which has been particularly problematic for countries on the mediterranean rim . maihold added that zapatero 's consensual approach to foreign policy has worked well for the european union .
unlike aznar , who had tried to elevate spain 's international profile by regular meetings with bush and then british prime minister tony blair , zapatero has generally has been content to take a backseat in the 27-nation bloc , letting france , germany and britain lead the eu . multilateral approach in foreign affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is concerned kosovar secession will encourage militant basques to declare independence other than in kosovo , where spain has come out against recognizing the former serbian province 's independence , madrid is content to let brussels take the driver 's seat in foreign policy issues , according to tom burns maranon , a news commentator and corporate strategist at madrid-based eurocofin . " zapatero is not interested in creating a spanish agenda in foreign affairs , but is keen on working within a multinational framework , " he said . the premier is concerned that kosovo 's recent secession from serbia could encourage spain 's own militant basque movement to declare independence unilaterally , maranon explained . experts disagree , however , on whether domestic or foreign affairs will be the focus of zapatero 's second term .
although over the last ten years spain has experienced unprecedented growth rates that have been largely fuelled by a construction boom , the economy has been slowing down due to the international credit crunch , maranon said . " zapatero could even wind up devoting more time to foreign affairs to deflect from problems at home , " he said . kern of gees , however , said zapatero could become so consumed with the domestic economy that there would be little energy left to focus on spain 's international role . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 11.03.2008 swiss coach gradually reviving hertha berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how long can the happiness at hertha last ?
at the start of 2008 , many german soccer experts picked hertha to be relegated .
but after a five-game undefeated streak , things are looking up in berlin .
that 's partly down to the work of their swiss coach , lucien favre . even hardcore hertha fans have trouble identifying all the players on the field these days - but that does n't mean they 're unhappy . after falling perilously close to the relegation zone , berlin has earned three wins and two draws in their last five matches , creating a comfortable cushion between themselves and the second division . what 's more , the team is playing arguably their most attacking , attractive soccer since 2000 , when berlin competed in the champions league . when hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness brought in swiss coach lucien favre in the off-season , he announced that 2007/08 would be a transitional year .
that was no exaggeration . gone are brazilian stars like gilberto and marcelinho , as well as problematic young talents such as kevin-prince boateng and ashkan dejagah .
taking their place are decidedly unfamiliar names like rudolf skacel and gojko kacar . so what are the reasons for hertha 's minor renaissance ? from cheese to clockwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre was hired in 2007 to re-route a team headed nowhere one major factor is that lucien favre has put his stamp on a squad often dismissed as uncoachable . favre - an extremely gifted soccer player whose own career was cut short by injury - favors what he calls " polyvalent " players .
what he means primarily are defensively solid midfielders who can advance the ball with one-touch passing . the formula definitely worked at favre 's previous club , fc zurich - they won two swiss league titles . the most obvious benefit of this philosophy for berlin has been defensive stability .
hertha conceded 55 goals in 34 bundesliga games in the 2007 calendar year - whereas after six games in 2008 , they 've let in a mere five . favre has also proven willing to improvise , scrapping his preferred back four for a 3-2-3-1-1 formation to better utilize hertha 's current personnel . berlin 's defense , which had been reminiscent of swiss cheese , is now working with some much-needed clockmaker 's precision . green but game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a revamped hertha squad beat defending champs stuttgart in february on the offensive end , hertha 's improvement under favre is n't as noticeable in the statistics . that 's partially due to the fact that hertha are fielding a young squad .
in their most recent match against dortmund , seven players out of the starting 11 were under the age of 25 . favre 's youngsters often lose their nerve when trying to make a precision last pass or convert opportunities .
in both of their draws this year , hertha were the stronger side and could have won with better finishing . on the plus side , the generational conflict that has plagued berlin in the last few seasons appears to have been laid to rest .
the youngsters respect the veterans ' authority , and experienced players have accepted a seat on the bench without much complaint . " if the players have an intelligence for the game , hierarchy is not a problem , " favre told dw-tv . berlin 's success rate with transfers has also improved since favre got involved .
in addition to skacel and kacar , striker raffael , midfielder fabian lustenberger and defender steve von bergen have all proved worthwhile additions to the squad . " you have to study a player very closely , " favre said .
" and if you make a mistake , you have a player under contract for two , three or even four years .
that 's expensive and creates a problem .
especially for the coach . " the pantelic situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marko pantelic - will he stay or will he go now ?
rarely has the mood been more harmonious at hertha .
indeed the only serious point of friction , for the moment , is between favre and hertha 's top performer , forward marko pantelic . the serbian striker has scored 11 goals this season , but berlin 's tabloids have repeatedly reported that favre considers pantelic too egotistic and would like to ship him off the coach is at pains to deny that . " if you want to get to the top , you have to emphasize the positive , " favre said .
" pantelic is trying hard to improve and play the sort of game i want . " nonetheless , should hertha , still burdened by millions in debt , be offered a hefty transfer fee for the serb , they might be tempted to take the money and extend favre 's rebuilding experiment . dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off , which airs thursday , march 13 , features an extensive interview with hertha coach lucien favre . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

months of debate over the transport fees that deutsche bahn is charging a traveling holocaust memorial escalated when a jewish community leader called bahn chief hartmut mehdorn " a nazi at heart . " " if mehdorn had held the same position in the third reich he would have arranged the deportation of jews with great conviction , " michael szentei-heise , a jewish community leader said at the opening of the zug der erinnerung , or train of commemoration , exhibition in dusseldorf on sunday , march 9 . the german state railway company responded with a statement tuesday that it was considering legal action . " the remarks are unforgivable and we will ask our lawyers to look into the matter , " the statement said . taxing the train of commemoration the disagreement further escalated tension over transport fees that deutsche bahn is charging the train of commemoration exhibit , for the use of its rails and stations .
housed in a series of old railway cars , the traveling exhibit is set to visit 15 cities before arriving at auschwitz in may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims were often brought by train to nazi death camps initially , deutsche bahn had refused to host the exhibition in its stations , saying that the difficult subject matter , which traces the plight of the 11,400 jewish children who were deported from france to auschwitz between 1942 and 1944 , deserved more than the divided attention of hurried commuters . after drawing sharp criticism for their stance , however , the rail company relented and instead had to charge the exhibition organizers fees that , according to szentei-heise , total of " a laughable 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 166,000 -rrb- . " " head of the new reichsbahn " " we have nothing against serious exhibitions , " a spokesperson for deutsche bahn told the rheinischer post newspaper tuesday .
" but we are obligated by law to collect fees . " referring to mehdorn as the " head of the new reichsbahn , " szentei-heise used rhetoric that harkens back to the nazi era .
the reichsbahn , the wartime predecessor to deutsche bahn , received 25 reichsmarks , or about 25 euros for each child it transported to the camp . the zug der erinnerung leaves dusseldorf for cologne on march 13 and will stop in an additional 14 stations throughout germany before closing at the auschwitz memorial in may . number of survivors falling the debate continued on the same day german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned tuesday against allowing memories of the holocaust to fade as the number of survivors of one of the darkest periods in european history dwindles . " the survivors are leaving us , " he said at a ceremony marking the opening of the secretariat of the task force for international cooperation on holocaust education , remembrance and research -lrb- itf -rrb- .

months of debate over the transport fees that deutsche bahn is charging a traveling holocaust memorial escalated when a jewish community leader called bahn chief hartmut mehdorn " a nazi at heart . " " if mehdorn had held the same position in the third reich he would have arranged the deportation of jews with great conviction , " michael szentei-heise , a jewish community leader said at the opening of the zug der erinnerung , or train of commemoration , exhibition in dusseldorf on sunday , march 9 . the german state railway company responded with a statement tuesday that it was considering legal action . " the remarks are unforgivable and we will ask our lawyers to look into the matter , " the statement said . taxing the train of commemoration the disagreement further escalated tension over transport fees that deutsche bahn is charging the train of commemoration exhibit , for the use of its rails and stations .
housed in a series of old railway cars , the traveling exhibit is set to visit 15 cities before arriving at auschwitz in may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims were often brought by train to nazi death camps initially , deutsche bahn had refused to host the exhibition in its stations , saying that the difficult subject matter , which traces the plight of the 11,400 jewish children who were deported from france to auschwitz between 1942 and 1944 , deserved more than the divided attention of hurried commuters . after drawing sharp criticism for their stance , however , the rail company relented and instead had to charge the exhibition organizers fees that , according to szentei-heise , total of " a laughable 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 166,000 -rrb- . " " head of the new reichsbahn " " we have nothing against serious exhibitions , " a spokesperson for deutsche bahn told the rheinischer post newspaper tuesday .
" but we are obligated by law to collect fees . " referring to mehdorn as the " head of the new reichsbahn , " szentei-heise used rhetoric that harkens back to the nazi era .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 11.03.2008 spain 's zapatero favors low profile in foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is usually willing to let brussels lead when it comes to foreign policy decisions reelected in circumstances similar to in 2004 , zapatero will likely demure to the eu when it comes to international politics .
except in the bloc 's relations with latin america , where he can take a lead role . it was deja-vu in spain on sunday , march 9 . socialist party leader jose luis zapatero , 47 , was reelected in an election with high voter turnout that was close to the record participation levels of 75 percent back in 2004 .
he had also scored a second victory over the same conservative opponent , mariano rajoy . there had even been a terrorist attack days before the election , when isaias carrasco , a municipal socialist legislator was shot dead , allegedly by basque separatists .
exactly four years ago , on march 11 , islamic terror attacks on madrid 's commuter trains had killed 191 people , and were followed by an election that had shocked spanish voters into ousting the incumbent right of center people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- in favor of the relatively unknown zapatero . virtually all spaniards agree that had 11-m , which is spanish shorthand for the madrid attacks , not occurred days before the 2004 elections , zapatero would not be serving two terms today . reversed us relationship in his first term , zapatero had taken spain in a radically different direction from his pp predecessor , jose maria aznar , especially in foreign policy .
aznar had been closely allied with us president george w. bush and had involved spain in the iraq war , which was opposed by 90 percent of spaniards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's aznar -lrb- center -rrb- and britain 's blair -lrb- left -rrb- had a privileged partnership with bush zapatero immediately reversed aznar 's policy and realigned spain with the france and germany in terms of the iraq war .
he fulfilled his campaign pledge of unilaterally withdrawing spanish troops from an international brigade - a move that angered the bush administration and sent us-spain relations on a downward spiral . " bush had been a convenient cover for expressing an ideological antipathy towards the us , " said soeren kern , a german fellow for transatlantic relations at the strategic studies group -lrb- gees -rrb- in madrid .
" even many socialists believe that zapatero has taken spain too far to the left . " zapatero grew up with a hard-core leftist ideology , so it is not just a matter of being anti-bush , but anti-hypercapitalist america , " he added . no need to rsvp zapatero has never been invited to the white house and even when us secretary of state condoleezza rice paid a courtesy call to madrid last year , policy differences on cuba were a bone of contention . spain , which maintains business interests with havana , wants to engage the communist dictatorship in a dialogue , whereas rice had chided her counterpart , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , for not doing enough to support human rights on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and spain could work to end cuba 's isolation now that castro has stepped down " it will take a new us president in 2009 to restore bilateral relations , " said antonio garrigues walker , honorary president of the spain-us council in madrid .
he emphasized that commercial and cultural exchanges are thriving in spite of the personal animosity between zapatero and bush . common ground in latin america garrigues pointed out that spain has become the fourth-largest foreign investor in the us , after canada , the uk and the netherlands , with much of its financial resources going into hispanic-owned businesses .
the spanish-speaking community is the fastest growing ethnic group in the us . he added that both countries can also find common ground in latin america , where spain has always had strong historical and linguistic ties to its former colonies .
and now that fidel castro has stepped down after nearly 50 years in power , they could even work constructively together to end cuba 's isolation . spain leads eu in latin america , north africa latin america is where spain could lead the european union in foreign policy , according to guenther maihold , a specialist in iberian and latin american affairs at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
zapatero 's policy of engagement in cuba , in particular , could be beneficial for both europe and the us . " another region where spain is influential is north africa , " said maihold , who explained that zapatero has actively sought an eu-wide solution to stem the flow of african migration to europe , which has been particularly problematic for countries on the mediterranean rim . maihold added that zapatero 's consensual approach to foreign policy has worked well for the european union .
unlike aznar , who had tried to elevate spain 's international profile by regular meetings with bush and then british prime minister tony blair , zapatero has generally has been content to take a backseat in the 27-nation bloc , letting france , germany and britain lead the eu . multilateral approach in foreign affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is concerned kosovar secession will encourage militant basques to declare independence other than in kosovo , where spain has come out against recognizing the former serbian province 's independence , madrid is content to let brussels take the driver 's seat in foreign policy issues , according to tom burns maranon , a news commentator and corporate strategist at madrid-based eurocofin . " zapatero is not interested in creating a spanish agenda in foreign affairs , but is keen on working within a multinational framework , " he said . the premier is concerned that kosovo 's recent secession from serbia could encourage spain 's own militant basque movement to declare independence unilaterally , maranon explained . experts disagree , however , on whether domestic or foreign affairs will be the focus of zapatero 's second term .
although over the last ten years spain has experienced unprecedented growth rates that have been largely fuelled by a construction boom , the economy has been slowing down due to the international credit crunch , maranon said . " zapatero could even wind up devoting more time to foreign affairs to deflect from problems at home , " he said . kern of gees , however , said zapatero could become so consumed with the domestic economy that there would be little energy left to focus on spain 's international role . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 11.03.2008 spain 's zapatero favors low profile in foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is usually willing to let brussels lead when it comes to foreign policy decisions reelected in circumstances similar to in 2004 , zapatero will likely demure to the eu when it comes to international politics .
except in the bloc 's relations with latin america , where he can take a lead role . it was deja-vu in spain on sunday , march 9 . socialist party leader jose luis zapatero , 47 , was reelected in an election with high voter turnout that was close to the record participation levels of 75 percent back in 2004 .
he had also scored a second victory over the same conservative opponent , mariano rajoy . there had even been a terrorist attack days before the election , when isaias carrasco , a municipal socialist legislator was shot dead , allegedly by basque separatists .
exactly four years ago , on march 11 , islamic terror attacks on madrid 's commuter trains had killed 191 people , and were followed by an election that had shocked spanish voters into ousting the incumbent right of center people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- in favor of the relatively unknown zapatero . virtually all spaniards agree that had 11-m , which is spanish shorthand for the madrid attacks , not occurred days before the 2004 elections , zapatero would not be serving two terms today . reversed us relationship in his first term , zapatero had taken spain in a radically different direction from his pp predecessor , jose maria aznar , especially in foreign policy .
aznar had been closely allied with us president george w. bush and had involved spain in the iraq war , which was opposed by 90 percent of spaniards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's aznar -lrb- center -rrb- and britain 's blair -lrb- left -rrb- had a privileged partnership with bush zapatero immediately reversed aznar 's policy and realigned spain with the france and germany in terms of the iraq war .
he fulfilled his campaign pledge of unilaterally withdrawing spanish troops from an international brigade - a move that angered the bush administration and sent us-spain relations on a downward spiral . " bush had been a convenient cover for expressing an ideological antipathy towards the us , " said soeren kern , a german fellow for transatlantic relations at the strategic studies group -lrb- gees -rrb- in madrid .
" even many socialists believe that zapatero has taken spain too far to the left . " zapatero grew up with a hard-core leftist ideology , so it is not just a matter of being anti-bush , but anti-hypercapitalist america , " he added . no need to rsvp zapatero has never been invited to the white house and even when us secretary of state condoleezza rice paid a courtesy call to madrid last year , policy differences on cuba were a bone of contention . spain , which maintains business interests with havana , wants to engage the communist dictatorship in a dialogue , whereas rice had chided her counterpart , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , for not doing enough to support human rights on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and spain could work to end cuba 's isolation now that castro has stepped down " it will take a new us president in 2009 to restore bilateral relations , " said antonio garrigues walker , honorary president of the spain-us council in madrid .
he emphasized that commercial and cultural exchanges are thriving in spite of the personal animosity between zapatero and bush . common ground in latin america garrigues pointed out that spain has become the fourth-largest foreign investor in the us , after canada , the uk and the netherlands , with much of its financial resources going into hispanic-owned businesses .
the spanish-speaking community is the fastest growing ethnic group in the us . he added that both countries can also find common ground in latin america , where spain has always had strong historical and linguistic ties to its former colonies .
and now that fidel castro has stepped down after nearly 50 years in power , they could even work constructively together to end cuba 's isolation . spain leads eu in latin america , north africa latin america is where spain could lead the european union in foreign policy , according to guenther maihold , a specialist in iberian and latin american affairs at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
zapatero 's policy of engagement in cuba , in particular , could be beneficial for both europe and the us . " another region where spain is influential is north africa , " said maihold , who explained that zapatero has actively sought an eu-wide solution to stem the flow of african migration to europe , which has been particularly problematic for countries on the mediterranean rim . maihold added that zapatero 's consensual approach to foreign policy has worked well for the european union .

washington said it hopes the groundbreaking deal will serve as a model for cooperation with other countries . under the new information sharing agreement , us and german law enforcement officials will have immediate , albeit partial , access to each other 's fingerprint and dna databases . the move will allow authorities to check within minutes if a database contains a suspected terrorist 's personal information .
should a match be found , authorities would then have to submit a request for more detailed information . the effort will speed up the exchange of information and help in the terrorist fight , said german and us officials who met in berlin to launch the bilateral agreement on tuesday , march 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal between berlin and washington could be a model for other bilateral agreements us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and us attorney general michael mukasey travelled to berlin to meet with german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries .
the deal will need german parliamentary ratification before becoming law , which schaeuble said he hopes will happen by the end of 2008 . " it is imperative as peace-loving nations we continue to work together to counter the threat of terrorism and to cooperate in this effort using every tool at our disposal , " chertoff said . a direct " hit " the cooperation includes a " hit / no-hit " procedure whereby a country can access another country 's national dna and fingerprint database and determine whether it contains a terror suspect 's data .
if a " hit " occurs , a formal application can be made for further information . " there is no automated exchange of information as such , but only an automated exchange of information on whether there is information available or not , " schaeuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much information should be shared ?

while courts have granted partial victories to those who advocate for more electronic surveillance , there 's a sense that courts are sensitive to rights issues . on tuesday , germany 's highest court ruled that a police practice of automatically scanning license plates to check them against a list of suspects violates the country 's constitution .
the court said the surveillance technique was too broad and allowed authorities to do things such as profile an individual 's movements . following a european model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chertoff said the deal includes " robust privacy protection " the deal is modeled on the pruem treaty signed by seven european union countries including germany in 2005 .

the information might be important to german officials , " but does that give the right to the united states , when i travel there and maybe have the wrong stamp in my passport , to get access to this data ?
i would say no , " schaar said . erosion of civil liberties ? zypries said she was not concerned that the agreement would erode civil liberties . " the data that is transferred can only be used in areas covered by the agreement and not for example as evidence in ongoing criminal cases , " zypries said at the joint news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians have called for greater cooperation " we have ensured that there is an obligation that automated requests for information and replies are recorded ... and , of course , there is an obligation for the data to be destroyed " if it is not used , she said . privacy has become a major issue in germany in recent years , with law enforcement agencies claiming they need more latitude to do their jobs .
while courts have granted partial victories to those who advocate for more electronic surveillance , there 's a sense that courts are sensitive to rights issues . on tuesday , germany 's highest court ruled that a police practice of automatically scanning license plates to check them against a list of suspects violates the country 's constitution .
the court said the surveillance technique was too broad and allowed authorities to do things such as profile an individual 's movements . following a european model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chertoff said the deal includes " robust privacy protection " the deal is modeled on the pruem treaty signed by seven european union countries including germany in 2005 .
the treaty was drawn up following train bombings in madrid by islamist radicals in 2004 which killed 191 people .
the treaty allows law enforcement in signatory countries to compare and exchange data more easily . the us is in preliminary talks with other countries on similar bilateral agreements . " this is a wonderful model , " mukasey said .
" i hope others will follow shortly . " chertoff added that europe and the us needed to cooperate in their efforts fighting international terrorism . " we are indeed fighting a networked , international enemy and , therefore , we have to respond with global networks of our own , " chertoff said .
" today 's agreement between the united states and germany reinforces our collective commitment to combat global terrorism while ensuring robust privacy protection . " germany has n't suffered a major attack the deal comes six months after german authorities made three arrests in an alleged plot to attack us interests and citizens in germany .
us intelligence had passed on information to berlin on the plan . two of the men arrested in september were german converts to islam and a third was turkish .
all had gone to pakistan for training and were stockpiling chemicals to make car bombs .
among the targets were us military installations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but we are obligated by law to collect fees . " referring to mehdorn as the " head of the new reichsbahn , " szentei-heise used rhetoric that harkens back to the nazi era .
the reichsbahn , the wartime predecessor to deutsche bahn , received 25 reichsmarks , or about 25 euros for each child it transported to the camp . the zug der erinnerung leaves dusseldorf for cologne on march 13 and will stop in an additional 14 stations throughout germany before closing at the auschwitz memorial in may . number of survivors falling the debate continued on the same day german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned tuesday against allowing memories of the holocaust to fade as the number of survivors of one of the darkest periods in european history dwindles .

at the start of 2008 , many german soccer experts picked hertha to be relegated .
but after a five-game undefeated streak , things are looking up in berlin .
that 's partly down to the work of their swiss coach , lucien favre . even hardcore hertha fans have trouble identifying all the players on the field these days - but that does n't mean they 're unhappy . after falling perilously close to the relegation zone , berlin has earned three wins and two draws in their last five matches , creating a comfortable cushion between themselves and the second division . what 's more , the team is playing arguably their most attacking , attractive soccer since 2000 , when berlin competed in the champions league . when hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness brought in swiss coach lucien favre in the off-season , he announced that 2007/08 would be a transitional year .
that was no exaggeration . gone are brazilian stars like gilberto and marcelinho , as well as problematic young talents such as kevin-prince boateng and ashkan dejagah .
taking their place are decidedly unfamiliar names like rudolf skacel and gojko kacar . so what are the reasons for hertha 's minor renaissance ? from cheese to clockwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre was hired in 2007 to re-route a team headed nowhere one major factor is that lucien favre has put his stamp on a squad often dismissed as uncoachable . favre - an extremely gifted soccer player whose own career was cut short by injury - favors what he calls " polyvalent " players .
what he means primarily are defensively solid midfielders who can advance the ball with one-touch passing . the formula definitely worked at favre 's previous club , fc zurich - they won two swiss league titles . the most obvious benefit of this philosophy for berlin has been defensive stability .
hertha conceded 55 goals in 34 bundesliga games in the 2007 calendar year - whereas after six games in 2008 , they 've let in a mere five . favre has also proven willing to improvise , scrapping his preferred back four for a 3-2-3-1-1 formation to better utilize hertha 's current personnel . berlin 's defense , which had been reminiscent of swiss cheese , is now working with some much-needed clockmaker 's precision . green but game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a revamped hertha squad beat defending champs stuttgart in february on the offensive end , hertha 's improvement under favre is n't as noticeable in the statistics . that 's partially due to the fact that hertha are fielding a young squad .
in their most recent match against dortmund , seven players out of the starting 11 were under the age of 25 . favre 's youngsters often lose their nerve when trying to make a precision last pass or convert opportunities .
in both of their draws this year , hertha were the stronger side and could have won with better finishing . on the plus side , the generational conflict that has plagued berlin in the last few seasons appears to have been laid to rest .
the youngsters respect the veterans ' authority , and experienced players have accepted a seat on the bench without much complaint . " if the players have an intelligence for the game , hierarchy is not a problem , " favre told dw-tv . berlin 's success rate with transfers has also improved since favre got involved .
in addition to skacel and kacar , striker raffael , midfielder fabian lustenberger and defender steve von bergen have all proved worthwhile additions to the squad . " you have to study a player very closely , " favre said .
" and if you make a mistake , you have a player under contract for two , three or even four years .
that 's expensive and creates a problem .
especially for the coach . " the pantelic situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marko pantelic - will he stay or will he go now ?

" if you want to get to the top , you have to emphasize the positive , " favre said .

berlin is scheduled to increase the number of troops stationed in afghanistan this summer . merkel said that while nato spoke of a comprehensive approach combining demands to focus on fighting the taliban and the desire for reconstruction there was little to be seen of this strategy in practice . calling for structured and effective coordination , the chancellor said there could be civil reconstruction without security but no security without civil reconstruction . alliance 's internal differences non-governmental organizations should also be included in this comprehensive approach , she added . her remarks highlighted differences within nato on the issue , with the united states believing that fighting insurgency in afghanistan should have priority over reconstruction . us , british , dutch and canadian soldiers have borne the brunt of the fight against the taliban in the south amid reluctance from allies like germany , france and italy to send their troops there . nato expansion questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer has repeatedly asked nato members to lift national troop restrictions merkel also voiced skepticism about nato expansion plans , saying states involved in regional conflicts should not become members of the alliance , an apparent reference to ukraine and georgia . " a country should become a nato member not only when its temporary political leadership is in favor but when a significant percentage of the population supports membership , " merkel said . ukraine and georgia participate in nato 's intensified dialogue program and aspire to become full members one day .
kyiv and tbilisi are expected to use the nato military alliance 's april 2-4 summit in romania to confirm that they are candidates to join the alliance , but their chances of securing a formal invitation seem remote . ukraine 's leaders have asked to join nato 's membership action plan , but lack public support for the move .
in georgia , the public is largely in favor of nato membership , but the alliance was made uneasy by the state of emergency the government imposed in december to end opposition protests . outgoing russian president vladimir putin has criticized nato 's expansion plans , accusing the alliance of trying to replace the united nations . georgia has unresolved disputes with abkhazia and south ossetia , while ukraine has been locked in a clinch with moscow over payments for fuel supplies . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 11.03.2008 german investors confident despite soaring euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin said it 's not concerned the euro 's value will hurt germany 's export-heavy economy surprise results from a key investor confidence survey have helped the euro to another all-time high against the dollar .
though the imbalance could hurt the economy , some investors apparently see blue skies ahead . the euro 's rise on foreign exchange markets could endanger economic growth in the euro zone , the european union 's slovenian presidency said on tuesday , march 11 , as the euro hit a record high just shy of $ 1.55 . " of course this is a problem that we are witnessing on a daily basis , " slovenia 's finance minister andrej bajuk said in an internet broadcast .
" we have come to the conclusion that these movements may not have a positive effect when it comes to economic growth and development . " the value of the euro , the currency in 15 european countries , has continued to climb as experts say the us economy slips toward a recession . " we believe that exchange rates should ... reflect the realities of the economy , " bajuk said .
" we also believe the foundations of the european economy are solid and wholesome . " the european central bank chief jean-claude trichet had on monday said he was " concerned by the excessive exchange rate fluctuations . "
the eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia also said currency markets were among his key concerns . " the excessive volatility indeed is a matter of concern , " he told journalists on monday . german economy to survive turmoil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking up , some economists say tuesday 's jump followed the announcement of better-than-expected investor sentiment in germany . " experts are more optimistic for the growth of the us economy in the next six months , " the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said in a statement accompanying its monthly report .
" moreover , they expect the dollar to appreciate versus the euro .
this should benefit export-oriented sectors of the german economy . " zew 's economic indicator for germany rose 7.5 points in march to minus 32.0 points after plummeting to minus 39.5 in february , the lowest point since january 1993 .
economists had predicted it would drop to below minus 40 points . " the optimism of the financial analysts is presumably based on the hope that the peak of the financial market crisis will be overcome in half a year and that business dynamics will not weaken more strongly than expected to date , " zew president wolfgang franz said upon the report 's release . though the financial experts surveyed seem to feel good about the near future , they gave a more negative assessment of the current situation in germany .
that indicator dropped by 1.6 points to 32.1 points due to the country 's weak economic growth figures . interest rates to remain stable , exports rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro has continued to reach new highs against the dollar the euro 's leap to nearly $ 1.55 also followed statements tuesday by axel weber , head of germany 's central bank , and a member of the european central bank 's rate-setting council , who ruled out a drop in interest rates . a high euro serves as a double-edged sword for the euro-zone economies .
while essential imports like oil , which is typically priced in dollars , become cheaper , its exports become more expensive abroad , making them less competitive on the global market . since the euro has been on the rise , germany has continued running up large trade surpluses .
according to data released monday , german exports rose by a larger-than-predicted 3.8 percent in january . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

though the imbalance could hurt the economy , some investors apparently see blue skies ahead . the euro 's rise on foreign exchange markets could endanger economic growth in the euro zone , the european union 's slovenian presidency said on tuesday , march 11 , as the euro hit a record high just shy of $ 1.55 . " of course this is a problem that we are witnessing on a daily basis , " slovenia 's finance minister andrej bajuk said in an internet broadcast .
" we have come to the conclusion that these movements may not have a positive effect when it comes to economic growth and development . " the value of the euro , the currency in 15 european countries , has continued to climb as experts say the us economy slips toward a recession . " we believe that exchange rates should ... reflect the realities of the economy , " bajuk said .
" we also believe the foundations of the european economy are solid and wholesome . " the european central bank chief jean-claude trichet had on monday said he was " concerned by the excessive exchange rate fluctuations . "
the eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia also said currency markets were among his key concerns . " the excessive volatility indeed is a matter of concern , " he told journalists on monday . german economy to survive turmoil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking up , some economists say tuesday 's jump followed the announcement of better-than-expected investor sentiment in germany . " experts are more optimistic for the growth of the us economy in the next six months , " the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said in a statement accompanying its monthly report .
" moreover , they expect the dollar to appreciate versus the euro .
this should benefit export-oriented sectors of the german economy . " zew 's economic indicator for germany rose 7.5 points in march to minus 32.0 points after plummeting to minus 39.5 in february , the lowest point since january 1993 .
economists had predicted it would drop to below minus 40 points . " the optimism of the financial analysts is presumably based on the hope that the peak of the financial market crisis will be overcome in half a year and that business dynamics will not weaken more strongly than expected to date , " zew president wolfgang franz said upon the report 's release . though the financial experts surveyed seem to feel good about the near future , they gave a more negative assessment of the current situation in germany .
that indicator dropped by 1.6 points to 32.1 points due to the country 's weak economic growth figures . interest rates to remain stable , exports rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro has continued to reach new highs against the dollar the euro 's leap to nearly $ 1.55 also followed statements tuesday by axel weber , head of germany 's central bank , and a member of the european central bank 's rate-setting council , who ruled out a drop in interest rates . a high euro serves as a double-edged sword for the euro-zone economies .
while essential imports like oil , which is typically priced in dollars , become cheaper , its exports become more expensive abroad , making them less competitive on the global market . since the euro has been on the rise , germany has continued running up large trade surpluses .
according to data released monday , german exports rose by a larger-than-predicted 3.8 percent in january . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political ideology was their main motivation , both in east and west germany . around 189,000 people were informers the secret police of the gdr 's communist regime , when the berlin wall fell in 1989 - that 's according to thuringia 's state office for researching east germany 's stasi on monday , march 10 . previously , the number of stasi informers in 1989 had been estimated at 174,000 .
the complete report , by historian helmut mueller-enberg , is to be published on thursday . the stasi relied heavily on ordinary people to report activity that deviated from the official political ideology in the country of 16 million .
according to mueller-enberg , 620,000 people worked undercover for the stasi in both east and west germany during the 51 years of the communist state 's existence . around 12,000 of them were west germans .
in east germany , one in 20 communist party members was a stasi spy . according to the report , political ideals served as the primary motivation for people to turn in their neighbors , friends and acquaintances to the secret police .

the catchphrase is part of a major publicity drive , but some people are asking : what would it mean to be berlin ? be successful berlin mayor klaus wowereit officially launched the slogan on tuesday , march 11 , as part of a 10.6 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- marketing initiative to encourage tourism and enhance the city 's image .
" with the branding campaign , the berlin senate wants to project berlin 's image outside the city , " woworeit said at the launch , " so that more people come visit us , more companies create new jobs here , and scientific , cultural and social richness of the city becomes easier to experience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be mayorial - wowereit 's previous phrase for berlin was " poor but sexy " the catchphrase vaguely echoes john f. kennedy 's " ich bin ein berliner " speech during the cold war and follows in the trend of cities using advertising slogans to brand themselves .
probably the most famous example is the " i love new york " campaign of the late 1970s .
more recently , the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg landed a hit with the slogan " we can do everything but speak proper german . "

" all berlin residents should be warned … that the imperative is meant literally , " wrote berlin columnist harald martenstein ahead of the official launch .
" when the first ' be berlin ' billboards are erected and the entire city populace stops bathing , quits their jobs and throws all their money out the window , saying that the berlin senate told them to do so , we 'll see we 've shot ourselves in the foot . "
indeed , tourists currently visiting berlin are getting a taste for just how disorderly the german capital can be .
the city 's public-transport workers are currently on strike , closing down the vast majority of subways , streetcars and busses and leaving visitors and natives alike to get around the huge metropolis as best they can .
be sarcastic bildunterschrift : be fluffy - some say knut could have come up with a better idea and berliners themselves - at least to judge from the blogs - seem underwhelmed by the campaign , greeting it with their characteristic sarcasm .
some have scoffed that the slogan sounds like a stutter .
others have quipped that a better catchphrase would be " bi berlin , " playing on the city 's tradition of tolerance .
a few berliners have complained that the campaign is in english , not german .
and a great many have speculated about how much the perennially cash-strapped capital paid for the three syllables .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be mayorial - wowereit 's previous phrase for berlin was " poor but sexy " the catchphrase vaguely echoes john f. kennedy 's " ich bin ein berliner " speech during the cold war and follows in the trend of cities using advertising slogans to brand themselves .
probably the most famous example is the " i love new york " campaign of the late 1970s .
more recently , the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg landed a hit with the slogan " we can do everything but speak proper german . "
berlin is germany 's top destination for tourists , attracting more than 8 million visitors and earning between 8 and 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12-14.5 billion -rrb- from them annually .
that 's a business berlin wants to expand .
be stranded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be building - construction sites are still all over the capital but the catchphrase has left many people scratching their heads as to what precisely one would be , if one were to choose to " be berlin " - all the more so since the debt-ridden capital is known just as much for being chaotic as it is for being creative .
" all berlin residents should be warned … that the imperative is meant literally , " wrote berlin columnist harald martenstein ahead of the official launch .
" when the first ' be berlin ' billboards are erected and the entire city populace stops bathing , quits their jobs and throws all their money out the window , saying that the berlin senate told them to do so , we 'll see we 've shot ourselves in the foot . "
indeed , tourists currently visiting berlin are getting a taste for just how disorderly the german capital can be .
the city 's public-transport workers are currently on strike , closing down the vast majority of subways , streetcars and busses and leaving visitors and natives alike to get around the huge metropolis as best they can .
be sarcastic bildunterschrift : be fluffy - some say knut could have come up with a better idea and berliners themselves - at least to judge from the blogs - seem underwhelmed by the campaign , greeting it with their characteristic sarcasm .
some have scoffed that the slogan sounds like a stutter .
others have quipped that a better catchphrase would be " bi berlin , " playing on the city 's tradition of tolerance .
a few berliners have complained that the campaign is in english , not german .
and a great many have speculated about how much the perennially cash-strapped capital paid for the three syllables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be broke - berlin 's debts have meant cuts in services like education " what did those two words cost ? " asked one blogger on the online page of the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" i can only shake my head . "
black humor was another response .
" the money has to be gotten rid of , " wrote a blogger on a page devoted to the capital .
" if it 's left lying around , someone will trip over it .
it 's better to spend it immediately .
then it 's out of the way , and everything 's hunky-dory . "
and with berlin already well known internationally for its nightlife and culture , it 's debatable whether the city really needed help on this score from pr experts .
in the words of one foreign tourist to ap news agency : " i do n't want to be berlin .
i wanted to come here to see the galleries . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

though the imbalance could hurt the economy , some investors apparently see blue skies ahead . the euro 's rise on foreign exchange markets could endanger economic growth in the euro zone , the european union 's slovenian presidency said on tuesday , march 11 , as the euro hit a record high just shy of $ 1.55 . " of course this is a problem that we are witnessing on a daily basis , " slovenia 's finance minister andrej bajuk said in an internet broadcast .

this should benefit export-oriented sectors of the german economy . " zew 's economic indicator for germany rose 7.5 points in march to minus 32.0 points after plummeting to minus 39.5 in february , the lowest point since january 1993 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 11.03.2008 berlin launches image campaign with new slogan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be partying - berlin is fun regardless of its slogan " be berlin " - that 's the message the german capital wants to project to the world .
the catchphrase is part of a major publicity drive , but some people are asking : what would it mean to be berlin ? be successful berlin mayor klaus wowereit officially launched the slogan on tuesday , march 11 , as part of a 10.6 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- marketing initiative to encourage tourism and enhance the city 's image .
" with the branding campaign , the berlin senate wants to project berlin 's image outside the city , " woworeit said at the launch , " so that more people come visit us , more companies create new jobs here , and scientific , cultural and social richness of the city becomes easier to experience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be mayorial - wowereit 's previous phrase for berlin was " poor but sexy " the catchphrase vaguely echoes john f. kennedy 's " ich bin ein berliner " speech during the cold war and follows in the trend of cities using advertising slogans to brand themselves .
probably the most famous example is the " i love new york " campaign of the late 1970s .
more recently , the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg landed a hit with the slogan " we can do everything but speak proper german . "

the catchphrase is part of a major publicity drive , but some people are asking : what would it mean to be berlin ? be successful berlin mayor klaus wowereit officially launched the slogan on tuesday , march 11 , as part of a 10.6 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- marketing initiative to encourage tourism and enhance the city 's image .
" with the branding campaign , the berlin senate wants to project berlin 's image outside the city , " woworeit said at the launch , " so that more people come visit us , more companies create new jobs here , and scientific , cultural and social richness of the city becomes easier to experience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be mayorial - wowereit 's previous phrase for berlin was " poor but sexy " the catchphrase vaguely echoes john f. kennedy 's " ich bin ein berliner " speech during the cold war and follows in the trend of cities using advertising slogans to brand themselves .
probably the most famous example is the " i love new york " campaign of the late 1970s .
more recently , the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg landed a hit with the slogan " we can do everything but speak proper german . "

political ideology was their main motivation , both in east and west germany . around 189,000 people were informers the secret police of the gdr 's communist regime , when the berlin wall fell in 1989 - that 's according to thuringia 's state office for researching east germany 's stasi on monday , march 10 . previously , the number of stasi informers in 1989 had been estimated at 174,000 .
the complete report , by historian helmut mueller-enberg , is to be published on thursday . the stasi relied heavily on ordinary people to report activity that deviated from the official political ideology in the country of 16 million .
according to mueller-enberg , 620,000 people worked undercover for the stasi in both east and west germany during the 51 years of the communist state 's existence . around 12,000 of them were west germans .
in east germany , one in 20 communist party members was a stasi spy . according to the report , political ideals served as the primary motivation for people to turn in their neighbors , friends and acquaintances to the secret police .
financial incentives played only a minor role and blackmail was rare . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 11.03.2008 berlin launches image campaign with new slogan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be partying - berlin is fun regardless of its slogan " be berlin " - that 's the message the german capital wants to project to the world .
the catchphrase is part of a major publicity drive , but some people are asking : what would it mean to be berlin ? be successful berlin mayor klaus wowereit officially launched the slogan on tuesday , march 11 , as part of a 10.6 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- marketing initiative to encourage tourism and enhance the city 's image .
" with the branding campaign , the berlin senate wants to project berlin 's image outside the city , " woworeit said at the launch , " so that more people come visit us , more companies create new jobs here , and scientific , cultural and social richness of the city becomes easier to experience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be mayorial - wowereit 's previous phrase for berlin was " poor but sexy " the catchphrase vaguely echoes john f. kennedy 's " ich bin ein berliner " speech during the cold war and follows in the trend of cities using advertising slogans to brand themselves .
probably the most famous example is the " i love new york " campaign of the late 1970s .
more recently , the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg landed a hit with the slogan " we can do everything but speak proper german . "
berlin is germany 's top destination for tourists , attracting more than 8 million visitors and earning between 8 and 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12-14.5 billion -rrb- from them annually .
that 's a business berlin wants to expand .
be stranded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be building - construction sites are still all over the capital but the catchphrase has left many people scratching their heads as to what precisely one would be , if one were to choose to " be berlin " - all the more so since the debt-ridden capital is known just as much for being chaotic as it is for being creative .
" all berlin residents should be warned … that the imperative is meant literally , " wrote berlin columnist harald martenstein ahead of the official launch .
" when the first ' be berlin ' billboards are erected and the entire city populace stops bathing , quits their jobs and throws all their money out the window , saying that the berlin senate told them to do so , we 'll see we 've shot ourselves in the foot . "
indeed , tourists currently visiting berlin are getting a taste for just how disorderly the german capital can be .
the city 's public-transport workers are currently on strike , closing down the vast majority of subways , streetcars and busses and leaving visitors and natives alike to get around the huge metropolis as best they can .
be sarcastic bildunterschrift : be fluffy - some say knut could have come up with a better idea and berliners themselves - at least to judge from the blogs - seem underwhelmed by the campaign , greeting it with their characteristic sarcasm .
some have scoffed that the slogan sounds like a stutter .
others have quipped that a better catchphrase would be " bi berlin , " playing on the city 's tradition of tolerance .
a few berliners have complained that the campaign is in english , not german .
and a great many have speculated about how much the perennially cash-strapped capital paid for the three syllables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be broke - berlin 's debts have meant cuts in services like education " what did those two words cost ? " asked one blogger on the online page of the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" i can only shake my head . "
black humor was another response .
" the money has to be gotten rid of , " wrote a blogger on a page devoted to the capital .
" if it 's left lying around , someone will trip over it .
it 's better to spend it immediately .
then it 's out of the way , and everything 's hunky-dory . "
and with berlin already well known internationally for its nightlife and culture , it 's debatable whether the city really needed help on this score from pr experts .
in the words of one foreign tourist to ap news agency : " i do n't want to be berlin .
i wanted to come here to see the galleries . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washington said it hopes the groundbreaking deal will serve as a model for cooperation with other countries . under the new information sharing agreement , us and german law enforcement officials will have immediate , albeit partial , access to each other 's fingerprint and dna databases . the move will allow authorities to check within minutes if a database contains a suspected terrorist 's personal information .

the deal will need german parliamentary ratification before becoming law , which schaeuble said he hopes will happen by the end of 2008 . " it is imperative as peace-loving nations we continue to work together to counter the threat of terrorism and to cooperate in this effort using every tool at our disposal , " chertoff said . a direct " hit " the cooperation includes a " hit / no-hit " procedure whereby a country can access another country 's national dna and fingerprint database and determine whether it contains a terror suspect 's data .

while courts have granted partial victories to those who advocate for more electronic surveillance , there 's a sense that courts are sensitive to rights issues . on tuesday , germany 's highest court ruled that a police practice of automatically scanning license plates to check them against a list of suspects violates the country 's constitution .

the information might be important to german officials , " but does that give the right to the united states , when i travel there and maybe have the wrong stamp in my passport , to get access to this data ?
i would say no , " schaar said . erosion of civil liberties ? zypries said she was not concerned that the agreement would erode civil liberties . " the data that is transferred can only be used in areas covered by the agreement and not for example as evidence in ongoing criminal cases , " zypries said at the joint news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians have called for greater cooperation " we have ensured that there is an obligation that automated requests for information and replies are recorded ... and , of course , there is an obligation for the data to be destroyed " if it is not used , she said . privacy has become a major issue in germany in recent years , with law enforcement agencies claiming they need more latitude to do their jobs .
while courts have granted partial victories to those who advocate for more electronic surveillance , there 's a sense that courts are sensitive to rights issues . on tuesday , germany 's highest court ruled that a police practice of automatically scanning license plates to check them against a list of suspects violates the country 's constitution .
the court said the surveillance technique was too broad and allowed authorities to do things such as profile an individual 's movements . following a european model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chertoff said the deal includes " robust privacy protection " the deal is modeled on the pruem treaty signed by seven european union countries including germany in 2005 .
the treaty was drawn up following train bombings in madrid by islamist radicals in 2004 which killed 191 people .
the treaty allows law enforcement in signatory countries to compare and exchange data more easily . the us is in preliminary talks with other countries on similar bilateral agreements . " this is a wonderful model , " mukasey said .
" i hope others will follow shortly . " chertoff added that europe and the us needed to cooperate in their efforts fighting international terrorism . " we are indeed fighting a networked , international enemy and , therefore , we have to respond with global networks of our own , " chertoff said .
" today 's agreement between the united states and germany reinforces our collective commitment to combat global terrorism while ensuring robust privacy protection . " germany has n't suffered a major attack the deal comes six months after german authorities made three arrests in an alleged plot to attack us interests and citizens in germany .
us intelligence had passed on information to berlin on the plan . two of the men arrested in september were german converts to islam and a third was turkish .
all had gone to pakistan for training and were stockpiling chemicals to make car bombs .
among the targets were us military installations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the start of 2008 , many german soccer experts picked hertha to be relegated .
but after a five-game undefeated streak , things are looking up in berlin .
that 's partly down to the work of their swiss coach , lucien favre . even hardcore hertha fans have trouble identifying all the players on the field these days - but that does n't mean they 're unhappy . after falling perilously close to the relegation zone , berlin has earned three wins and two draws in their last five matches , creating a comfortable cushion between themselves and the second division . what 's more , the team is playing arguably their most attacking , attractive soccer since 2000 , when berlin competed in the champions league . when hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness brought in swiss coach lucien favre in the off-season , he announced that 2007/08 would be a transitional year .
that was no exaggeration . gone are brazilian stars like gilberto and marcelinho , as well as problematic young talents such as kevin-prince boateng and ashkan dejagah .
taking their place are decidedly unfamiliar names like rudolf skacel and gojko kacar . so what are the reasons for hertha 's minor renaissance ? from cheese to clockwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre was hired in 2007 to re-route a team headed nowhere one major factor is that lucien favre has put his stamp on a squad often dismissed as uncoachable . favre - an extremely gifted soccer player whose own career was cut short by injury - favors what he calls " polyvalent " players .
what he means primarily are defensively solid midfielders who can advance the ball with one-touch passing . the formula definitely worked at favre 's previous club , fc zurich - they won two swiss league titles . the most obvious benefit of this philosophy for berlin has been defensive stability .
hertha conceded 55 goals in 34 bundesliga games in the 2007 calendar year - whereas after six games in 2008 , they 've let in a mere five . favre has also proven willing to improvise , scrapping his preferred back four for a 3-2-3-1-1 formation to better utilize hertha 's current personnel . berlin 's defense , which had been reminiscent of swiss cheese , is now working with some much-needed clockmaker 's precision . green but game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a revamped hertha squad beat defending champs stuttgart in february on the offensive end , hertha 's improvement under favre is n't as noticeable in the statistics . that 's partially due to the fact that hertha are fielding a young squad .
in their most recent match against dortmund , seven players out of the starting 11 were under the age of 25 . favre 's youngsters often lose their nerve when trying to make a precision last pass or convert opportunities .
in both of their draws this year , hertha were the stronger side and could have won with better finishing . on the plus side , the generational conflict that has plagued berlin in the last few seasons appears to have been laid to rest .
the youngsters respect the veterans ' authority , and experienced players have accepted a seat on the bench without much complaint . " if the players have an intelligence for the game , hierarchy is not a problem , " favre told dw-tv . berlin 's success rate with transfers has also improved since favre got involved .
in addition to skacel and kacar , striker raffael , midfielder fabian lustenberger and defender steve von bergen have all proved worthwhile additions to the squad . " you have to study a player very closely , " favre said .
" and if you make a mistake , you have a player under contract for two , three or even four years .
that 's expensive and creates a problem .
especially for the coach . " the pantelic situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marko pantelic - will he stay or will he go now ?
rarely has the mood been more harmonious at hertha .
indeed the only serious point of friction , for the moment , is between favre and hertha 's top performer , forward marko pantelic . the serbian striker has scored 11 goals this season , but berlin 's tabloids have repeatedly reported that favre considers pantelic too egotistic and would like to ship him off the coach is at pains to deny that . " if you want to get to the top , you have to emphasize the positive , " favre said .
" pantelic is trying hard to improve and play the sort of game i want .

hertha conceded 55 goals in 34 bundesliga games in the 2007 calendar year - whereas after six games in 2008 , they 've let in a mere five . favre has also proven willing to improvise , scrapping his preferred back four for a 3-2-3-1-1 formation to better utilize hertha 's current personnel . berlin 's defense , which had been reminiscent of swiss cheese , is now working with some much-needed clockmaker 's precision . green but game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a revamped hertha squad beat defending champs stuttgart in february on the offensive end , hertha 's improvement under favre is n't as noticeable in the statistics . that 's partially due to the fact that hertha are fielding a young squad .
in their most recent match against dortmund , seven players out of the starting 11 were under the age of 25 . favre 's youngsters often lose their nerve when trying to make a precision last pass or convert opportunities .
in both of their draws this year , hertha were the stronger side and could have won with better finishing . on the plus side , the generational conflict that has plagued berlin in the last few seasons appears to have been laid to rest .
the youngsters respect the veterans ' authority , and experienced players have accepted a seat on the bench without much complaint . " if the players have an intelligence for the game , hierarchy is not a problem , " favre told dw-tv . berlin 's success rate with transfers has also improved since favre got involved .
in addition to skacel and kacar , striker raffael , midfielder fabian lustenberger and defender steve von bergen have all proved worthwhile additions to the squad . " you have to study a player very closely , " favre said .
" and if you make a mistake , you have a player under contract for two , three or even four years .
that 's expensive and creates a problem .
especially for the coach . " the pantelic situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marko pantelic - will he stay or will he go now ?
rarely has the mood been more harmonious at hertha .
indeed the only serious point of friction , for the moment , is between favre and hertha 's top performer , forward marko pantelic . the serbian striker has scored 11 goals this season , but berlin 's tabloids have repeatedly reported that favre considers pantelic too egotistic and would like to ship him off the coach is at pains to deny that . " if you want to get to the top , you have to emphasize the positive , " favre said .
" pantelic is trying hard to improve and play the sort of game i want . " nonetheless , should hertha , still burdened by millions in debt , be offered a hefty transfer fee for the serb , they might be tempted to take the money and extend favre 's rebuilding experiment . dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off , which airs thursday , march 13 , features an extensive interview with hertha coach lucien favre . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

except in the bloc 's relations with latin america , where he can take a lead role . it was deja-vu in spain on sunday , march 9 . socialist party leader jose luis zapatero , 47 , was reelected in an election with high voter turnout that was close to the record participation levels of 75 percent back in 2004 .
he had also scored a second victory over the same conservative opponent , mariano rajoy . there had even been a terrorist attack days before the election , when isaias carrasco , a municipal socialist legislator was shot dead , allegedly by basque separatists .

aznar had been closely allied with us president george w. bush and had involved spain in the iraq war , which was opposed by 90 percent of spaniards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's aznar -lrb- center -rrb- and britain 's blair -lrb- left -rrb- had a privileged partnership with bush zapatero immediately reversed aznar 's policy and realigned spain with the france and germany in terms of the iraq war .
he fulfilled his campaign pledge of unilaterally withdrawing spanish troops from an international brigade - a move that angered the bush administration and sent us-spain relations on a downward spiral . " bush had been a convenient cover for expressing an ideological antipathy towards the us , " said soeren kern , a german fellow for transatlantic relations at the strategic studies group -lrb- gees -rrb- in madrid .
" even many socialists believe that zapatero has taken spain too far to the left . " zapatero grew up with a hard-core leftist ideology , so it is not just a matter of being anti-bush , but anti-hypercapitalist america , " he added . no need to rsvp zapatero has never been invited to the white house and even when us secretary of state condoleezza rice paid a courtesy call to madrid last year , policy differences on cuba were a bone of contention . spain , which maintains business interests with havana , wants to engage the communist dictatorship in a dialogue , whereas rice had chided her counterpart , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , for not doing enough to support human rights on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and spain could work to end cuba 's isolation now that castro has stepped down " it will take a new us president in 2009 to restore bilateral relations , " said antonio garrigues walker , honorary president of the spain-us council in madrid .

the spanish-speaking community is the fastest growing ethnic group in the us . he added that both countries can also find common ground in latin america , where spain has always had strong historical and linguistic ties to its former colonies .
and now that fidel castro has stepped down after nearly 50 years in power , they could even work constructively together to end cuba 's isolation . spain leads eu in latin america , north africa latin america is where spain could lead the european union in foreign policy , according to guenther maihold , a specialist in iberian and latin american affairs at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
zapatero 's policy of engagement in cuba , in particular , could be beneficial for both europe and the us .

although over the last ten years spain has experienced unprecedented growth rates that have been largely fuelled by a construction boom , the economy has been slowing down due to the international credit crunch , maranon said . " zapatero could even wind up devoting more time to foreign affairs to deflect from problems at home , " he said . kern of gees , however , said zapatero could become so consumed with the domestic economy that there would be little energy left to focus on spain 's international role . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

except in the bloc 's relations with latin america , where he can take a lead role . it was deja-vu in spain on sunday , march 9 . socialist party leader jose luis zapatero , 47 , was reelected in an election with high voter turnout that was close to the record participation levels of 75 percent back in 2004 .
he had also scored a second victory over the same conservative opponent , mariano rajoy . there had even been a terrorist attack days before the election , when isaias carrasco , a municipal socialist legislator was shot dead , allegedly by basque separatists .
exactly four years ago , on march 11 , islamic terror attacks on madrid 's commuter trains had killed 191 people , and were followed by an election that had shocked spanish voters into ousting the incumbent right of center people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- in favor of the relatively unknown zapatero . virtually all spaniards agree that had 11-m , which is spanish shorthand for the madrid attacks , not occurred days before the 2004 elections , zapatero would not be serving two terms today . reversed us relationship in his first term , zapatero had taken spain in a radically different direction from his pp predecessor , jose maria aznar , especially in foreign policy .
aznar had been closely allied with us president george w. bush and had involved spain in the iraq war , which was opposed by 90 percent of spaniards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's aznar -lrb- center -rrb- and britain 's blair -lrb- left -rrb- had a privileged partnership with bush zapatero immediately reversed aznar 's policy and realigned spain with the france and germany in terms of the iraq war .
he fulfilled his campaign pledge of unilaterally withdrawing spanish troops from an international brigade - a move that angered the bush administration and sent us-spain relations on a downward spiral . " bush had been a convenient cover for expressing an ideological antipathy towards the us , " said soeren kern , a german fellow for transatlantic relations at the strategic studies group -lrb- gees -rrb- in madrid .
" even many socialists believe that zapatero has taken spain too far to the left . " zapatero grew up with a hard-core leftist ideology , so it is not just a matter of being anti-bush , but anti-hypercapitalist america , " he added . no need to rsvp zapatero has never been invited to the white house and even when us secretary of state condoleezza rice paid a courtesy call to madrid last year , policy differences on cuba were a bone of contention . spain , which maintains business interests with havana , wants to engage the communist dictatorship in a dialogue , whereas rice had chided her counterpart , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , for not doing enough to support human rights on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and spain could work to end cuba 's isolation now that castro has stepped down " it will take a new us president in 2009 to restore bilateral relations , " said antonio garrigues walker , honorary president of the spain-us council in madrid .
he emphasized that commercial and cultural exchanges are thriving in spite of the personal animosity between zapatero and bush . common ground in latin america garrigues pointed out that spain has become the fourth-largest foreign investor in the us , after canada , the uk and the netherlands , with much of its financial resources going into hispanic-owned businesses .
the spanish-speaking community is the fastest growing ethnic group in the us . he added that both countries can also find common ground in latin america , where spain has always had strong historical and linguistic ties to its former colonies .
and now that fidel castro has stepped down after nearly 50 years in power , they could even work constructively together to end cuba 's isolation . spain leads eu in latin america , north africa latin america is where spain could lead the european union in foreign policy , according to guenther maihold , a specialist in iberian and latin american affairs at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
zapatero 's policy of engagement in cuba , in particular , could be beneficial for both europe and the us . " another region where spain is influential is north africa , " said maihold , who explained that zapatero has actively sought an eu-wide solution to stem the flow of african migration to europe , which has been particularly problematic for countries on the mediterranean rim . maihold added that zapatero 's consensual approach to foreign policy has worked well for the european union .

months of debate over the transport fees that deutsche bahn is charging a traveling holocaust memorial escalated when a jewish community leader called bahn chief hartmut mehdorn " a nazi at heart . " " if mehdorn had held the same position in the third reich he would have arranged the deportation of jews with great conviction , " michael szentei-heise , a jewish community leader said at the opening of the zug der erinnerung , or train of commemoration , exhibition in dusseldorf on sunday , march 9 . the german state railway company responded with a statement tuesday that it was considering legal action . " the remarks are unforgivable and we will ask our lawyers to look into the matter , " the statement said . taxing the train of commemoration the disagreement further escalated tension over transport fees that deutsche bahn is charging the train of commemoration exhibit , for the use of its rails and stations .
housed in a series of old railway cars , the traveling exhibit is set to visit 15 cities before arriving at auschwitz in may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims were often brought by train to nazi death camps initially , deutsche bahn had refused to host the exhibition in its stations , saying that the difficult subject matter , which traces the plight of the 11,400 jewish children who were deported from france to auschwitz between 1942 and 1944 , deserved more than the divided attention of hurried commuters . after drawing sharp criticism for their stance , however , the rail company relented and instead had to charge the exhibition organizers fees that , according to szentei-heise , total of " a laughable 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 166,000 -rrb- . " " head of the new reichsbahn " " we have nothing against serious exhibitions , " a spokesperson for deutsche bahn told the rheinischer post newspaper tuesday .
" but we are obligated by law to collect fees . " referring to mehdorn as the " head of the new reichsbahn , " szentei-heise used rhetoric that harkens back to the nazi era .
the reichsbahn , the wartime predecessor to deutsche bahn , received 25 reichsmarks , or about 25 euros for each child it transported to the camp . the zug der erinnerung leaves dusseldorf for cologne on march 13 and will stop in an additional 14 stations throughout germany before closing at the auschwitz memorial in may . number of survivors falling the debate continued on the same day german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned tuesday against allowing memories of the holocaust to fade as the number of survivors of one of the darkest periods in european history dwindles . " the survivors are leaving us , " he said at a ceremony marking the opening of the secretariat of the task force for international cooperation on holocaust education , remembrance and research -lrb- itf -rrb- .
the natural authority of their voices is fading .

months of debate over the transport fees that deutsche bahn is charging a traveling holocaust memorial escalated when a jewish community leader called bahn chief hartmut mehdorn " a nazi at heart . " " if mehdorn had held the same position in the third reich he would have arranged the deportation of jews with great conviction , " michael szentei-heise , a jewish community leader said at the opening of the zug der erinnerung , or train of commemoration , exhibition in dusseldorf on sunday , march 9 . the german state railway company responded with a statement tuesday that it was considering legal action . " the remarks are unforgivable and we will ask our lawyers to look into the matter , " the statement said . taxing the train of commemoration the disagreement further escalated tension over transport fees that deutsche bahn is charging the train of commemoration exhibit , for the use of its rails and stations .
housed in a series of old railway cars , the traveling exhibit is set to visit 15 cities before arriving at auschwitz in may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims were often brought by train to nazi death camps initially , deutsche bahn had refused to host the exhibition in its stations , saying that the difficult subject matter , which traces the plight of the 11,400 jewish children who were deported from france to auschwitz between 1942 and 1944 , deserved more than the divided attention of hurried commuters . after drawing sharp criticism for their stance , however , the rail company relented and instead had to charge the exhibition organizers fees that , according to szentei-heise , total of " a laughable 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 166,000 -rrb- .

" but we are obligated by law to collect fees . " referring to mehdorn as the " head of the new reichsbahn , " szentei-heise used rhetoric that harkens back to the nazi era .
the reichsbahn , the wartime predecessor to deutsche bahn , received 25 reichsmarks , or about 25 euros for each child it transported to the camp . the zug der erinnerung leaves dusseldorf for cologne on march 13 and will stop in an additional 14 stations throughout germany before closing at the auschwitz memorial in may . number of survivors falling the debate continued on the same day german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned tuesday against allowing memories of the holocaust to fade as the number of survivors of one of the darkest periods in european history dwindles .

at the start of 2008 , many german soccer experts picked hertha to be relegated .
but after a five-game undefeated streak , things are looking up in berlin .
that 's partly down to the work of their swiss coach , lucien favre . even hardcore hertha fans have trouble identifying all the players on the field these days - but that does n't mean they 're unhappy . after falling perilously close to the relegation zone , berlin has earned three wins and two draws in their last five matches , creating a comfortable cushion between themselves and the second division . what 's more , the team is playing arguably their most attacking , attractive soccer since 2000 , when berlin competed in the champions league . when hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness brought in swiss coach lucien favre in the off-season , he announced that 2007/08 would be a transitional year .
that was no exaggeration . gone are brazilian stars like gilberto and marcelinho , as well as problematic young talents such as kevin-prince boateng and ashkan dejagah .
taking their place are decidedly unfamiliar names like rudolf skacel and gojko kacar . so what are the reasons for hertha 's minor renaissance ? from cheese to clockwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre was hired in 2007 to re-route a team headed nowhere one major factor is that lucien favre has put his stamp on a squad often dismissed as uncoachable . favre - an extremely gifted soccer player whose own career was cut short by injury - favors what he calls " polyvalent " players .
what he means primarily are defensively solid midfielders who can advance the ball with one-touch passing . the formula definitely worked at favre 's previous club , fc zurich - they won two swiss league titles . the most obvious benefit of this philosophy for berlin has been defensive stability .
hertha conceded 55 goals in 34 bundesliga games in the 2007 calendar year - whereas after six games in 2008 , they 've let in a mere five . favre has also proven willing to improvise , scrapping his preferred back four for a 3-2-3-1-1 formation to better utilize hertha 's current personnel . berlin 's defense , which had been reminiscent of swiss cheese , is now working with some much-needed clockmaker 's precision . green but game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a revamped hertha squad beat defending champs stuttgart in february on the offensive end , hertha 's improvement under favre is n't as noticeable in the statistics . that 's partially due to the fact that hertha are fielding a young squad .
in their most recent match against dortmund , seven players out of the starting 11 were under the age of 25 . favre 's youngsters often lose their nerve when trying to make a precision last pass or convert opportunities .
in both of their draws this year , hertha were the stronger side and could have won with better finishing . on the plus side , the generational conflict that has plagued berlin in the last few seasons appears to have been laid to rest .
the youngsters respect the veterans ' authority , and experienced players have accepted a seat on the bench without much complaint . " if the players have an intelligence for the game , hierarchy is not a problem , " favre told dw-tv . berlin 's success rate with transfers has also improved since favre got involved .
in addition to skacel and kacar , striker raffael , midfielder fabian lustenberger and defender steve von bergen have all proved worthwhile additions to the squad . " you have to study a player very closely , " favre said .
" and if you make a mistake , you have a player under contract for two , three or even four years .
that 's expensive and creates a problem .
especially for the coach . " the pantelic situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marko pantelic - will he stay or will he go now ?
rarely has the mood been more harmonious at hertha .
indeed the only serious point of friction , for the moment , is between favre and hertha 's top performer , forward marko pantelic . the serbian striker has scored 11 goals this season , but berlin 's tabloids have repeatedly reported that favre considers pantelic too egotistic and would like to ship him off the coach is at pains to deny that . " if you want to get to the top , you have to emphasize the positive , " favre said .
" pantelic is trying hard to improve and play the sort of game i want .

at the start of 2008 , many german soccer experts picked hertha to be relegated .
but after a five-game undefeated streak , things are looking up in berlin .
that 's partly down to the work of their swiss coach , lucien favre . even hardcore hertha fans have trouble identifying all the players on the field these days - but that does n't mean they 're unhappy . after falling perilously close to the relegation zone , berlin has earned three wins and two draws in their last five matches , creating a comfortable cushion between themselves and the second division . what 's more , the team is playing arguably their most attacking , attractive soccer since 2000 , when berlin competed in the champions league . when hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness brought in swiss coach lucien favre in the off-season , he announced that 2007/08 would be a transitional year .
that was no exaggeration . gone are brazilian stars like gilberto and marcelinho , as well as problematic young talents such as kevin-prince boateng and ashkan dejagah .
taking their place are decidedly unfamiliar names like rudolf skacel and gojko kacar . so what are the reasons for hertha 's minor renaissance ? from cheese to clockwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre was hired in 2007 to re-route a team headed nowhere one major factor is that lucien favre has put his stamp on a squad often dismissed as uncoachable . favre - an extremely gifted soccer player whose own career was cut short by injury - favors what he calls " polyvalent " players .
what he means primarily are defensively solid midfielders who can advance the ball with one-touch passing . the formula definitely worked at favre 's previous club , fc zurich - they won two swiss league titles . the most obvious benefit of this philosophy for berlin has been defensive stability .
hertha conceded 55 goals in 34 bundesliga games in the 2007 calendar year - whereas after six games in 2008 , they 've let in a mere five . favre has also proven willing to improvise , scrapping his preferred back four for a 3-2-3-1-1 formation to better utilize hertha 's current personnel . berlin 's defense , which had been reminiscent of swiss cheese , is now working with some much-needed clockmaker 's precision . green but game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a revamped hertha squad beat defending champs stuttgart in february on the offensive end , hertha 's improvement under favre is n't as noticeable in the statistics . that 's partially due to the fact that hertha are fielding a young squad .
in their most recent match against dortmund , seven players out of the starting 11 were under the age of 25 . favre 's youngsters often lose their nerve when trying to make a precision last pass or convert opportunities .
in both of their draws this year , hertha were the stronger side and could have won with better finishing . on the plus side , the generational conflict that has plagued berlin in the last few seasons appears to have been laid to rest .
the youngsters respect the veterans ' authority , and experienced players have accepted a seat on the bench without much complaint . " if the players have an intelligence for the game , hierarchy is not a problem , " favre told dw-tv . berlin 's success rate with transfers has also improved since favre got involved .
in addition to skacel and kacar , striker raffael , midfielder fabian lustenberger and defender steve von bergen have all proved worthwhile additions to the squad . " you have to study a player very closely , " favre said .
" and if you make a mistake , you have a player under contract for two , three or even four years .
that 's expensive and creates a problem .
especially for the coach . " the pantelic situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marko pantelic - will he stay or will he go now ?
rarely has the mood been more harmonious at hertha .
indeed the only serious point of friction , for the moment , is between favre and hertha 's top performer , forward marko pantelic . the serbian striker has scored 11 goals this season , but berlin 's tabloids have repeatedly reported that favre considers pantelic too egotistic and would like to ship him off the coach is at pains to deny that . " if you want to get to the top , you have to emphasize the positive , " favre said .
" pantelic is trying hard to improve and play the sort of game i want .

washington said it hopes the groundbreaking deal will serve as a model for cooperation with other countries . under the new information sharing agreement , us and german law enforcement officials will have immediate , albeit partial , access to each other 's fingerprint and dna databases . the move will allow authorities to check within minutes if a database contains a suspected terrorist 's personal information .
should a match be found , authorities would then have to submit a request for more detailed information . the effort will speed up the exchange of information and help in the terrorist fight , said german and us officials who met in berlin to launch the bilateral agreement on tuesday , march 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal between berlin and washington could be a model for other bilateral agreements us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and us attorney general michael mukasey travelled to berlin to meet with german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries .
the deal will need german parliamentary ratification before becoming law , which schaeuble said he hopes will happen by the end of 2008 . " it is imperative as peace-loving nations we continue to work together to counter the threat of terrorism and to cooperate in this effort using every tool at our disposal , " chertoff said . a direct " hit " the cooperation includes a " hit / no-hit " procedure whereby a country can access another country 's national dna and fingerprint database and determine whether it contains a terror suspect 's data .
if a " hit " occurs , a formal application can be made for further information . " there is no automated exchange of information as such , but only an automated exchange of information on whether there is information available or not , " schaeuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much information should be shared ?
the exception is dna files , which are not allowed to be automatically shared under us law , schaeuble said . but the plan still raises privacy concerns , germany 's independent privacy commissioner peter schaar said on german public radio deutschlandfunk . schaar gave the example of a protestor who is fingerprinted by german police .

" the data that is transferred can only be used in areas covered by the agreement and not for example as evidence in ongoing criminal cases , " zypries said at the joint news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians have called for greater cooperation " we have ensured that there is an obligation that automated requests for information and replies are recorded ... and , of course , there is an obligation for the data to be destroyed " if it is not used , she said . privacy has become a major issue in germany in recent years , with law enforcement agencies claiming they need more latitude to do their jobs .
while courts have granted partial victories to those who advocate for more electronic surveillance , there 's a sense that courts are sensitive to rights issues . on tuesday , germany 's highest court ruled that a police practice of automatically scanning license plates to check them against a list of suspects violates the country 's constitution .
the court said the surveillance technique was too broad and allowed authorities to do things such as profile an individual 's movements . following a european model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chertoff said the deal includes " robust privacy protection " the deal is modeled on the pruem treaty signed by seven european union countries including germany in 2005 .
the treaty was drawn up following train bombings in madrid by islamist radicals in 2004 which killed 191 people .
the treaty allows law enforcement in signatory countries to compare and exchange data more easily . the us is in preliminary talks with other countries on similar bilateral agreements . " this is a wonderful model , " mukasey said .
" i hope others will follow shortly . " chertoff added that europe and the us needed to cooperate in their efforts fighting international terrorism . " we are indeed fighting a networked , international enemy and , therefore , we have to respond with global networks of our own , " chertoff said .

though the imbalance could hurt the economy , some investors apparently see blue skies ahead . the euro 's rise on foreign exchange markets could endanger economic growth in the euro zone , the european union 's slovenian presidency said on tuesday , march 11 , as the euro hit a record high just shy of $ 1.55 . " of course this is a problem that we are witnessing on a daily basis , " slovenia 's finance minister andrej bajuk said in an internet broadcast .
" we have come to the conclusion that these movements may not have a positive effect when it comes to economic growth and development . " the value of the euro , the currency in 15 european countries , has continued to climb as experts say the us economy slips toward a recession . " we believe that exchange rates should ... reflect the realities of the economy , " bajuk said .
" we also believe the foundations of the european economy are solid and wholesome . " the european central bank chief jean-claude trichet had on monday said he was " concerned by the excessive exchange rate fluctuations . "
the eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia also said currency markets were among his key concerns . " the excessive volatility indeed is a matter of concern , " he told journalists on monday . german economy to survive turmoil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking up , some economists say tuesday 's jump followed the announcement of better-than-expected investor sentiment in germany . " experts are more optimistic for the growth of the us economy in the next six months , " the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said in a statement accompanying its monthly report .
" moreover , they expect the dollar to appreciate versus the euro .
this should benefit export-oriented sectors of the german economy . " zew 's economic indicator for germany rose 7.5 points in march to minus 32.0 points after plummeting to minus 39.5 in february , the lowest point since january 1993 .
economists had predicted it would drop to below minus 40 points . " the optimism of the financial analysts is presumably based on the hope that the peak of the financial market crisis will be overcome in half a year and that business dynamics will not weaken more strongly than expected to date , " zew president wolfgang franz said upon the report 's release . though the financial experts surveyed seem to feel good about the near future , they gave a more negative assessment of the current situation in germany .
that indicator dropped by 1.6 points to 32.1 points due to the country 's weak economic growth figures . interest rates to remain stable , exports rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro has continued to reach new highs against the dollar the euro 's leap to nearly $ 1.55 also followed statements tuesday by axel weber , head of germany 's central bank , and a member of the european central bank 's rate-setting council , who ruled out a drop in interest rates . a high euro serves as a double-edged sword for the euro-zone economies .
while essential imports like oil , which is typically priced in dollars , become cheaper , its exports become more expensive abroad , making them less competitive on the global market . since the euro has been on the rise , germany has continued running up large trade surpluses .
according to data released monday , german exports rose by a larger-than-predicted 3.8 percent in january . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the catchphrase is part of a major publicity drive , but some people are asking : what would it mean to be berlin ? be successful berlin mayor klaus wowereit officially launched the slogan on tuesday , march 11 , as part of a 10.6 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- marketing initiative to encourage tourism and enhance the city 's image .
" with the branding campaign , the berlin senate wants to project berlin 's image outside the city , " woworeit said at the launch , " so that more people come visit us , more companies create new jobs here , and scientific , cultural and social richness of the city becomes easier to experience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be mayorial - wowereit 's previous phrase for berlin was " poor but sexy " the catchphrase vaguely echoes john f. kennedy 's " ich bin ein berliner " speech during the cold war and follows in the trend of cities using advertising slogans to brand themselves .
probably the most famous example is the " i love new york " campaign of the late 1970s .
more recently , the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg landed a hit with the slogan " we can do everything but speak proper german . "
berlin is germany 's top destination for tourists , attracting more than 8 million visitors and earning between 8 and 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12-14.5 billion -rrb- from them annually .
that 's a business berlin wants to expand .
be stranded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be building - construction sites are still all over the capital but the catchphrase has left many people scratching their heads as to what precisely one would be , if one were to choose to " be berlin " - all the more so since the debt-ridden capital is known just as much for being chaotic as it is for being creative .
" all berlin residents should be warned … that the imperative is meant literally , " wrote berlin columnist harald martenstein ahead of the official launch .
" when the first ' be berlin ' billboards are erected and the entire city populace stops bathing , quits their jobs and throws all their money out the window , saying that the berlin senate told them to do so , we 'll see we 've shot ourselves in the foot . "
indeed , tourists currently visiting berlin are getting a taste for just how disorderly the german capital can be .
the city 's public-transport workers are currently on strike , closing down the vast majority of subways , streetcars and busses and leaving visitors and natives alike to get around the huge metropolis as best they can .
be sarcastic bildunterschrift : be fluffy - some say knut could have come up with a better idea and berliners themselves - at least to judge from the blogs - seem underwhelmed by the campaign , greeting it with their characteristic sarcasm .
some have scoffed that the slogan sounds like a stutter .
others have quipped that a better catchphrase would be " bi berlin , " playing on the city 's tradition of tolerance .
a few berliners have complained that the campaign is in english , not german .
and a great many have speculated about how much the perennially cash-strapped capital paid for the three syllables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be broke - berlin 's debts have meant cuts in services like education " what did those two words cost ? " asked one blogger on the online page of the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" i can only shake my head . "
black humor was another response .
" the money has to be gotten rid of , " wrote a blogger on a page devoted to the capital .
" if it 's left lying around , someone will trip over it .
it 's better to spend it immediately .
then it 's out of the way , and everything 's hunky-dory . "
and with berlin already well known internationally for its nightlife and culture , it 's debatable whether the city really needed help on this score from pr experts .

she stressed that germany would not lift restrictions on troops in the country . the trans-atlantic alliance is a pillar of germany 's foreign and security policy , but it has to move away from purely military thinking , she told a meeting of german armed forces commanders in berlin on monday , march 10 . the chancellor also affirmed germany 's opposition to extending its military role in afghanistan to the volatile south , a move requested by the united states and other nato members . she said her country 's nato-led troops were needed in the relatively peaceful north , where they were engaged mainly in civilian reconstruction projects . nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told the gathering that afghanistan should not be divided into spheres of responsibility for peacekeeping , combat operations and reconstruction . the country would be won or lost in its entirety , he said . everyone 's a target in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : focusing on reconstruction is n't a guarantee of safety for german troops those building schools in the north are just as much a target of the taliban as those fighting the country 's former fundamentalist rulers in the south , he said . germany has around 3,500 troops serving with the 40,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan as well as a squad of military-surveillance aircraft .
berlin is scheduled to increase the number of troops stationed in afghanistan this summer . merkel said that while nato spoke of a comprehensive approach combining demands to focus on fighting the taliban and the desire for reconstruction there was little to be seen of this strategy in practice . calling for structured and effective coordination , the chancellor said there could be civil reconstruction without security but no security without civil reconstruction . alliance 's internal differences non-governmental organizations should also be included in this comprehensive approach , she added . her remarks highlighted differences within nato on the issue , with the united states believing that fighting insurgency in afghanistan should have priority over reconstruction . us , british , dutch and canadian soldiers have borne the brunt of the fight against the taliban in the south amid reluctance from allies like germany , france and italy to send their troops there . nato expansion questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer has repeatedly asked nato members to lift national troop restrictions merkel also voiced skepticism about nato expansion plans , saying states involved in regional conflicts should not become members of the alliance , an apparent reference to ukraine and georgia .

months of debate over the transport fees that deutsche bahn is charging a traveling holocaust memorial escalated when a jewish community leader called bahn chief hartmut mehdorn " a nazi at heart . " " if mehdorn had held the same position in the third reich he would have arranged the deportation of jews with great conviction , " michael szentei-heise , a jewish community leader said at the opening of the zug der erinnerung , or train of commemoration , exhibition in dusseldorf on sunday , march 9 . the german state railway company responded with a statement tuesday that it was considering legal action . " the remarks are unforgivable and we will ask our lawyers to look into the matter , " the statement said . taxing the train of commemoration the disagreement further escalated tension over transport fees that deutsche bahn is charging the train of commemoration exhibit , for the use of its rails and stations .
housed in a series of old railway cars , the traveling exhibit is set to visit 15 cities before arriving at auschwitz in may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims were often brought by train to nazi death camps initially , deutsche bahn had refused to host the exhibition in its stations , saying that the difficult subject matter , which traces the plight of the 11,400 jewish children who were deported from france to auschwitz between 1942 and 1944 , deserved more than the divided attention of hurried commuters . after drawing sharp criticism for their stance , however , the rail company relented and instead had to charge the exhibition organizers fees that , according to szentei-heise , total of " a laughable 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 166,000 -rrb- . " " head of the new reichsbahn " " we have nothing against serious exhibitions , " a spokesperson for deutsche bahn told the rheinischer post newspaper tuesday .
" but we are obligated by law to collect fees . " referring to mehdorn as the " head of the new reichsbahn , " szentei-heise used rhetoric that harkens back to the nazi era .
the reichsbahn , the wartime predecessor to deutsche bahn , received 25 reichsmarks , or about 25 euros for each child it transported to the camp . the zug der erinnerung leaves dusseldorf for cologne on march 13 and will stop in an additional 14 stations throughout germany before closing at the auschwitz memorial in may . number of survivors falling the debate continued on the same day german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned tuesday against allowing memories of the holocaust to fade as the number of survivors of one of the darkest periods in european history dwindles . " the survivors are leaving us , " he said at a ceremony marking the opening of the secretariat of the task force for international cooperation on holocaust education , remembrance and research -lrb- itf -rrb- .
the natural authority of their voices is fading . " we have to make sure that the memory does not fade into the distance , become more abstract or disappears behind the veil of history , " steinmeier added . the itf was initiated by former swedish prime minister goran persson in 1998 and formally established at a founding conference in stockholm in 2000 .
it currently has 25 member states and consists of governmental and nongovernmental organizations . its aim is to preserve the memory of the holocaust and promote holocaust education and research as a means of countering anti-semitic tendencies in society . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 11.03.2008 berlin launches image campaign with new slogan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be partying - berlin is fun regardless of its slogan " be berlin " - that 's the message the german capital wants to project to the world .
the catchphrase is part of a major publicity drive , but some people are asking : what would it mean to be berlin ? be successful berlin mayor klaus wowereit officially launched the slogan on tuesday , march 11 , as part of a 10.6 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- marketing initiative to encourage tourism and enhance the city 's image .
" with the branding campaign , the berlin senate wants to project berlin 's image outside the city , " woworeit said at the launch , " so that more people come visit us , more companies create new jobs here , and scientific , cultural and social richness of the city becomes easier to experience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be mayorial - wowereit 's previous phrase for berlin was " poor but sexy " the catchphrase vaguely echoes john f. kennedy 's " ich bin ein berliner " speech during the cold war and follows in the trend of cities using advertising slogans to brand themselves .
probably the most famous example is the " i love new york " campaign of the late 1970s .
more recently , the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg landed a hit with the slogan " we can do everything but speak proper german . "
berlin is germany 's top destination for tourists , attracting more than 8 million visitors and earning between 8 and 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12-14.5 billion -rrb- from them annually .
that 's a business berlin wants to expand .
be stranded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be building - construction sites are still all over the capital but the catchphrase has left many people scratching their heads as to what precisely one would be , if one were to choose to " be berlin " - all the more so since the debt-ridden capital is known just as much for being chaotic as it is for being creative .
" all berlin residents should be warned … that the imperative is meant literally , " wrote berlin columnist harald martenstein ahead of the official launch .
" when the first ' be berlin ' billboards are erected and the entire city populace stops bathing , quits their jobs and throws all their money out the window , saying that the berlin senate told them to do so , we 'll see we 've shot ourselves in the foot . "
indeed , tourists currently visiting berlin are getting a taste for just how disorderly the german capital can be .
the city 's public-transport workers are currently on strike , closing down the vast majority of subways , streetcars and busses and leaving visitors and natives alike to get around the huge metropolis as best they can .
be sarcastic bildunterschrift : be fluffy - some say knut could have come up with a better idea and berliners themselves - at least to judge from the blogs - seem underwhelmed by the campaign , greeting it with their characteristic sarcasm .
some have scoffed that the slogan sounds like a stutter .
others have quipped that a better catchphrase would be " bi berlin , " playing on the city 's tradition of tolerance .
a few berliners have complained that the campaign is in english , not german .
and a great many have speculated about how much the perennially cash-strapped capital paid for the three syllables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be broke - berlin 's debts have meant cuts in services like education " what did those two words cost ? " asked one blogger on the online page of the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" i can only shake my head . "
black humor was another response .
" the money has to be gotten rid of , " wrote a blogger on a page devoted to the capital .
" if it 's left lying around , someone will trip over it .
it 's better to spend it immediately .
then it 's out of the way , and everything 's hunky-dory . "
and with berlin already well known internationally for its nightlife and culture , it 's debatable whether the city really needed help on this score from pr experts .
in the words of one foreign tourist to ap news agency : " i do n't want to be berlin .
i wanted to come here to see the galleries . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washington said it hopes the groundbreaking deal will serve as a model for cooperation with other countries . under the new information sharing agreement , us and german law enforcement officials will have immediate , albeit partial , access to each other 's fingerprint and dna databases . the move will allow authorities to check within minutes if a database contains a suspected terrorist 's personal information .
should a match be found , authorities would then have to submit a request for more detailed information . the effort will speed up the exchange of information and help in the terrorist fight , said german and us officials who met in berlin to launch the bilateral agreement on tuesday , march 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal between berlin and washington could be a model for other bilateral agreements us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and us attorney general michael mukasey travelled to berlin to meet with german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries .
the deal will need german parliamentary ratification before becoming law , which schaeuble said he hopes will happen by the end of 2008 . " it is imperative as peace-loving nations we continue to work together to counter the threat of terrorism and to cooperate in this effort using every tool at our disposal , " chertoff said . a direct " hit " the cooperation includes a " hit / no-hit " procedure whereby a country can access another country 's national dna and fingerprint database and determine whether it contains a terror suspect 's data .
if a " hit " occurs , a formal application can be made for further information . " there is no automated exchange of information as such , but only an automated exchange of information on whether there is information available or not , " schaeuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much information should be shared ?
the exception is dna files , which are not allowed to be automatically shared under us law , schaeuble said . but the plan still raises privacy concerns , germany 's independent privacy commissioner peter schaar said on german public radio deutschlandfunk . schaar gave the example of a protestor who is fingerprinted by german police .
the information might be important to german officials , " but does that give the right to the united states , when i travel there and maybe have the wrong stamp in my passport , to get access to this data ?
i would say no , " schaar said . erosion of civil liberties ? zypries said she was not concerned that the agreement would erode civil liberties . " the data that is transferred can only be used in areas covered by the agreement and not for example as evidence in ongoing criminal cases , " zypries said at the joint news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians have called for greater cooperation " we have ensured that there is an obligation that automated requests for information and replies are recorded ... and , of course , there is an obligation for the data to be destroyed " if it is not used , she said . privacy has become a major issue in germany in recent years , with law enforcement agencies claiming they need more latitude to do their jobs .
while courts have granted partial victories to those who advocate for more electronic surveillance , there 's a sense that courts are sensitive to rights issues . on tuesday , germany 's highest court ruled that a police practice of automatically scanning license plates to check them against a list of suspects violates the country 's constitution .
the court said the surveillance technique was too broad and allowed authorities to do things such as profile an individual 's movements . following a european model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chertoff said the deal includes " robust privacy protection " the deal is modeled on the pruem treaty signed by seven european union countries including germany in 2005 .
the treaty was drawn up following train bombings in madrid by islamist radicals in 2004 which killed 191 people .
the treaty allows law enforcement in signatory countries to compare and exchange data more easily . the us is in preliminary talks with other countries on similar bilateral agreements . " this is a wonderful model , " mukasey said .
" i hope others will follow shortly . " chertoff added that europe and the us needed to cooperate in their efforts fighting international terrorism . " we are indeed fighting a networked , international enemy and , therefore , we have to respond with global networks of our own , " chertoff said .
" today 's agreement between the united states and germany reinforces our collective commitment to combat global terrorism while ensuring robust privacy protection . " germany has n't suffered a major attack the deal comes six months after german authorities made three arrests in an alleged plot to attack us interests and citizens in germany .
us intelligence had passed on information to berlin on the plan . two of the men arrested in september were german converts to islam and a third was turkish .
all had gone to pakistan for training and were stockpiling chemicals to make car bombs .
among the targets were us military installations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political ideology was their main motivation , both in east and west germany . around 189,000 people were informers the secret police of the gdr 's communist regime , when the berlin wall fell in 1989 - that 's according to thuringia 's state office for researching east germany 's stasi on monday , march 10 . previously , the number of stasi informers in 1989 had been estimated at 174,000 .
the complete report , by historian helmut mueller-enberg , is to be published on thursday . the stasi relied heavily on ordinary people to report activity that deviated from the official political ideology in the country of 16 million .
according to mueller-enberg , 620,000 people worked undercover for the stasi in both east and west germany during the 51 years of the communist state 's existence . around 12,000 of them were west germans .
in east germany , one in 20 communist party members was a stasi spy . according to the report , political ideals served as the primary motivation for people to turn in their neighbors , friends and acquaintances to the secret police .
financial incentives played only a minor role and blackmail was rare . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 11.03.2008 west needs coordinated afghan policy , merkel says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is still searching for a way to keep all the troops marching in the same direction chancellor angela merkel called on nato members to improve coordination of military and civil elements in crisis areas such as afghanistan .
she stressed that germany would not lift restrictions on troops in the country . the trans-atlantic alliance is a pillar of germany 's foreign and security policy , but it has to move away from purely military thinking , she told a meeting of german armed forces commanders in berlin on monday , march 10 . the chancellor also affirmed germany 's opposition to extending its military role in afghanistan to the volatile south , a move requested by the united states and other nato members . she said her country 's nato-led troops were needed in the relatively peaceful north , where they were engaged mainly in civilian reconstruction projects . nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told the gathering that afghanistan should not be divided into spheres of responsibility for peacekeeping , combat operations and reconstruction . the country would be won or lost in its entirety , he said . everyone 's a target in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : focusing on reconstruction is n't a guarantee of safety for german troops those building schools in the north are just as much a target of the taliban as those fighting the country 's former fundamentalist rulers in the south , he said . germany has around 3,500 troops serving with the 40,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan as well as a squad of military-surveillance aircraft .
berlin is scheduled to increase the number of troops stationed in afghanistan this summer . merkel said that while nato spoke of a comprehensive approach combining demands to focus on fighting the taliban and the desire for reconstruction there was little to be seen of this strategy in practice . calling for structured and effective coordination , the chancellor said there could be civil reconstruction without security but no security without civil reconstruction . alliance 's internal differences non-governmental organizations should also be included in this comprehensive approach , she added . her remarks highlighted differences within nato on the issue , with the united states believing that fighting insurgency in afghanistan should have priority over reconstruction . us , british , dutch and canadian soldiers have borne the brunt of the fight against the taliban in the south amid reluctance from allies like germany , france and italy to send their troops there . nato expansion questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer has repeatedly asked nato members to lift national troop restrictions merkel also voiced skepticism about nato expansion plans , saying states involved in regional conflicts should not become members of the alliance , an apparent reference to ukraine and georgia . " a country should become a nato member not only when its temporary political leadership is in favor but when a significant percentage of the population supports membership , " merkel said . ukraine and georgia participate in nato 's intensified dialogue program and aspire to become full members one day .
kyiv and tbilisi are expected to use the nato military alliance 's april 2-4 summit in romania to confirm that they are candidates to join the alliance , but their chances of securing a formal invitation seem remote . ukraine 's leaders have asked to join nato 's membership action plan , but lack public support for the move .
in georgia , the public is largely in favor of nato membership , but the alliance was made uneasy by the state of emergency the government imposed in december to end opposition protests . outgoing russian president vladimir putin has criticized nato 's expansion plans , accusing the alliance of trying to replace the united nations . georgia has unresolved disputes with abkhazia and south ossetia , while ukraine has been locked in a clinch with moscow over payments for fuel supplies . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he had also scored a second victory over the same conservative opponent , mariano rajoy . there had even been a terrorist attack days before the election , when isaias carrasco , a municipal socialist legislator was shot dead , allegedly by basque separatists .
exactly four years ago , on march 11 , islamic terror attacks on madrid 's commuter trains had killed 191 people , and were followed by an election that had shocked spanish voters into ousting the incumbent right of center people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- in favor of the relatively unknown zapatero . virtually all spaniards agree that had 11-m , which is spanish shorthand for the madrid attacks , not occurred days before the 2004 elections , zapatero would not be serving two terms today . reversed us relationship in his first term , zapatero had taken spain in a radically different direction from his pp predecessor , jose maria aznar , especially in foreign policy .
aznar had been closely allied with us president george w. bush and had involved spain in the iraq war , which was opposed by 90 percent of spaniards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's aznar -lrb- center -rrb- and britain 's blair -lrb- left -rrb- had a privileged partnership with bush zapatero immediately reversed aznar 's policy and realigned spain with the france and germany in terms of the iraq war .
he fulfilled his campaign pledge of unilaterally withdrawing spanish troops from an international brigade - a move that angered the bush administration and sent us-spain relations on a downward spiral . " bush had been a convenient cover for expressing an ideological antipathy towards the us , " said soeren kern , a german fellow for transatlantic relations at the strategic studies group -lrb- gees -rrb- in madrid .
" even many socialists believe that zapatero has taken spain too far to the left . " zapatero grew up with a hard-core leftist ideology , so it is not just a matter of being anti-bush , but anti-hypercapitalist america , " he added . no need to rsvp zapatero has never been invited to the white house and even when us secretary of state condoleezza rice paid a courtesy call to madrid last year , policy differences on cuba were a bone of contention . spain , which maintains business interests with havana , wants to engage the communist dictatorship in a dialogue , whereas rice had chided her counterpart , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , for not doing enough to support human rights on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and spain could work to end cuba 's isolation now that castro has stepped down " it will take a new us president in 2009 to restore bilateral relations , " said antonio garrigues walker , honorary president of the spain-us council in madrid .
he emphasized that commercial and cultural exchanges are thriving in spite of the personal animosity between zapatero and bush . common ground in latin america garrigues pointed out that spain has become the fourth-largest foreign investor in the us , after canada , the uk and the netherlands , with much of its financial resources going into hispanic-owned businesses .
the spanish-speaking community is the fastest growing ethnic group in the us . he added that both countries can also find common ground in latin america , where spain has always had strong historical and linguistic ties to its former colonies .
and now that fidel castro has stepped down after nearly 50 years in power , they could even work constructively together to end cuba 's isolation . spain leads eu in latin america , north africa latin america is where spain could lead the european union in foreign policy , according to guenther maihold , a specialist in iberian and latin american affairs at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
zapatero 's policy of engagement in cuba , in particular , could be beneficial for both europe and the us . " another region where spain is influential is north africa , " said maihold , who explained that zapatero has actively sought an eu-wide solution to stem the flow of african migration to europe , which has been particularly problematic for countries on the mediterranean rim . maihold added that zapatero 's consensual approach to foreign policy has worked well for the european union .
unlike aznar , who had tried to elevate spain 's international profile by regular meetings with bush and then british prime minister tony blair , zapatero has generally has been content to take a backseat in the 27-nation bloc , letting france , germany and britain lead the eu . multilateral approach in foreign affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is concerned kosovar secession will encourage militant basques to declare independence other than in kosovo , where spain has come out against recognizing the former serbian province 's independence , madrid is content to let brussels take the driver 's seat in foreign policy issues , according to tom burns maranon , a news commentator and corporate strategist at madrid-based eurocofin . " zapatero is not interested in creating a spanish agenda in foreign affairs , but is keen on working within a multinational framework , " he said . the premier is concerned that kosovo 's recent secession from serbia could encourage spain 's own militant basque movement to declare independence unilaterally , maranon explained . experts disagree , however , on whether domestic or foreign affairs will be the focus of zapatero 's second term .
although over the last ten years spain has experienced unprecedented growth rates that have been largely fuelled by a construction boom , the economy has been slowing down due to the international credit crunch , maranon said . " zapatero could even wind up devoting more time to foreign affairs to deflect from problems at home , " he said . kern of gees , however , said zapatero could become so consumed with the domestic economy that there would be little energy left to focus on spain 's international role . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she stressed that germany would not lift restrictions on troops in the country . the trans-atlantic alliance is a pillar of germany 's foreign and security policy , but it has to move away from purely military thinking , she told a meeting of german armed forces commanders in berlin on monday , march 10 . the chancellor also affirmed germany 's opposition to extending its military role in afghanistan to the volatile south , a move requested by the united states and other nato members . she said her country 's nato-led troops were needed in the relatively peaceful north , where they were engaged mainly in civilian reconstruction projects . nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told the gathering that afghanistan should not be divided into spheres of responsibility for peacekeeping , combat operations and reconstruction . the country would be won or lost in its entirety , he said . everyone 's a target in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : focusing on reconstruction is n't a guarantee of safety for german troops those building schools in the north are just as much a target of the taliban as those fighting the country 's former fundamentalist rulers in the south , he said . germany has around 3,500 troops serving with the 40,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan as well as a squad of military-surveillance aircraft .
berlin is scheduled to increase the number of troops stationed in afghanistan this summer . merkel said that while nato spoke of a comprehensive approach combining demands to focus on fighting the taliban and the desire for reconstruction there was little to be seen of this strategy in practice . calling for structured and effective coordination , the chancellor said there could be civil reconstruction without security but no security without civil reconstruction . alliance 's internal differences non-governmental organizations should also be included in this comprehensive approach , she added . her remarks highlighted differences within nato on the issue , with the united states believing that fighting insurgency in afghanistan should have priority over reconstruction . us , british , dutch and canadian soldiers have borne the brunt of the fight against the taliban in the south amid reluctance from allies like germany , france and italy to send their troops there . nato expansion questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer has repeatedly asked nato members to lift national troop restrictions merkel also voiced skepticism about nato expansion plans , saying states involved in regional conflicts should not become members of the alliance , an apparent reference to ukraine and georgia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 11.03.2008 berlin launches image campaign with new slogan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be partying - berlin is fun regardless of its slogan " be berlin " - that 's the message the german capital wants to project to the world .
the catchphrase is part of a major publicity drive , but some people are asking : what would it mean to be berlin ? be successful berlin mayor klaus wowereit officially launched the slogan on tuesday , march 11 , as part of a 10.6 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- marketing initiative to encourage tourism and enhance the city 's image .
" with the branding campaign , the berlin senate wants to project berlin 's image outside the city , " woworeit said at the launch , " so that more people come visit us , more companies create new jobs here , and scientific , cultural and social richness of the city becomes easier to experience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be mayorial - wowereit 's previous phrase for berlin was " poor but sexy " the catchphrase vaguely echoes john f. kennedy 's " ich bin ein berliner " speech during the cold war and follows in the trend of cities using advertising slogans to brand themselves .
probably the most famous example is the " i love new york " campaign of the late 1970s .
more recently , the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg landed a hit with the slogan " we can do everything but speak proper german . "
berlin is germany 's top destination for tourists , attracting more than 8 million visitors and earning between 8 and 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12-14.5 billion -rrb- from them annually .
that 's a business berlin wants to expand .
be stranded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be building - construction sites are still all over the capital but the catchphrase has left many people scratching their heads as to what precisely one would be , if one were to choose to " be berlin " - all the more so since the debt-ridden capital is known just as much for being chaotic as it is for being creative .
" all berlin residents should be warned … that the imperative is meant literally , " wrote berlin columnist harald martenstein ahead of the official launch .
" when the first ' be berlin ' billboards are erected and the entire city populace stops bathing , quits their jobs and throws all their money out the window , saying that the berlin senate told them to do so , we 'll see we 've shot ourselves in the foot . "
indeed , tourists currently visiting berlin are getting a taste for just how disorderly the german capital can be .
the city 's public-transport workers are currently on strike , closing down the vast majority of subways , streetcars and busses and leaving visitors and natives alike to get around the huge metropolis as best they can .
be sarcastic bildunterschrift : be fluffy - some say knut could have come up with a better idea and berliners themselves - at least to judge from the blogs - seem underwhelmed by the campaign , greeting it with their characteristic sarcasm .
some have scoffed that the slogan sounds like a stutter .
others have quipped that a better catchphrase would be " bi berlin , " playing on the city 's tradition of tolerance .
a few berliners have complained that the campaign is in english , not german .
and a great many have speculated about how much the perennially cash-strapped capital paid for the three syllables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be broke - berlin 's debts have meant cuts in services like education " what did those two words cost ? " asked one blogger on the online page of the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" i can only shake my head . "
black humor was another response .
" the money has to be gotten rid of , " wrote a blogger on a page devoted to the capital .
" if it 's left lying around , someone will trip over it .
it 's better to spend it immediately .
then it 's out of the way , and everything 's hunky-dory . "
and with berlin already well known internationally for its nightlife and culture , it 's debatable whether the city really needed help on this score from pr experts .

washington said it hopes the groundbreaking deal will serve as a model for cooperation with other countries . under the new information sharing agreement , us and german law enforcement officials will have immediate , albeit partial , access to each other 's fingerprint and dna databases . the move will allow authorities to check within minutes if a database contains a suspected terrorist 's personal information .
should a match be found , authorities would then have to submit a request for more detailed information . the effort will speed up the exchange of information and help in the terrorist fight , said german and us officials who met in berlin to launch the bilateral agreement on tuesday , march 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal between berlin and washington could be a model for other bilateral agreements us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and us attorney general michael mukasey travelled to berlin to meet with german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries .
the deal will need german parliamentary ratification before becoming law , which schaeuble said he hopes will happen by the end of 2008 . " it is imperative as peace-loving nations we continue to work together to counter the threat of terrorism and to cooperate in this effort using every tool at our disposal , " chertoff said . a direct " hit " the cooperation includes a " hit / no-hit " procedure whereby a country can access another country 's national dna and fingerprint database and determine whether it contains a terror suspect 's data .
if a " hit " occurs , a formal application can be made for further information . " there is no automated exchange of information as such , but only an automated exchange of information on whether there is information available or not , " schaeuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much information should be shared ?
the exception is dna files , which are not allowed to be automatically shared under us law , schaeuble said . but the plan still raises privacy concerns , germany 's independent privacy commissioner peter schaar said on german public radio deutschlandfunk . schaar gave the example of a protestor who is fingerprinted by german police .
the information might be important to german officials , " but does that give the right to the united states , when i travel there and maybe have the wrong stamp in my passport , to get access to this data ?
i would say no , " schaar said . erosion of civil liberties ? zypries said she was not concerned that the agreement would erode civil liberties . " the data that is transferred can only be used in areas covered by the agreement and not for example as evidence in ongoing criminal cases , " zypries said at the joint news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians have called for greater cooperation " we have ensured that there is an obligation that automated requests for information and replies are recorded ... and , of course , there is an obligation for the data to be destroyed " if it is not used , she said . privacy has become a major issue in germany in recent years , with law enforcement agencies claiming they need more latitude to do their jobs .
while courts have granted partial victories to those who advocate for more electronic surveillance , there 's a sense that courts are sensitive to rights issues . on tuesday , germany 's highest court ruled that a police practice of automatically scanning license plates to check them against a list of suspects violates the country 's constitution .
the court said the surveillance technique was too broad and allowed authorities to do things such as profile an individual 's movements . following a european model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chertoff said the deal includes " robust privacy protection " the deal is modeled on the pruem treaty signed by seven european union countries including germany in 2005 .
the treaty was drawn up following train bombings in madrid by islamist radicals in 2004 which killed 191 people .
the treaty allows law enforcement in signatory countries to compare and exchange data more easily . the us is in preliminary talks with other countries on similar bilateral agreements . " this is a wonderful model , " mukasey said .
" i hope others will follow shortly . " chertoff added that europe and the us needed to cooperate in their efforts fighting international terrorism . " we are indeed fighting a networked , international enemy and , therefore , we have to respond with global networks of our own , " chertoff said .
" today 's agreement between the united states and germany reinforces our collective commitment to combat global terrorism while ensuring robust privacy protection . " germany has n't suffered a major attack the deal comes six months after german authorities made three arrests in an alleged plot to attack us interests and citizens in germany .
us intelligence had passed on information to berlin on the plan . two of the men arrested in september were german converts to islam and a third was turkish .
all had gone to pakistan for training and were stockpiling chemicals to make car bombs .
among the targets were us military installations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washington said it hopes the groundbreaking deal will serve as a model for cooperation with other countries . under the new information sharing agreement , us and german law enforcement officials will have immediate , albeit partial , access to each other 's fingerprint and dna databases . the move will allow authorities to check within minutes if a database contains a suspected terrorist 's personal information .
should a match be found , authorities would then have to submit a request for more detailed information . the effort will speed up the exchange of information and help in the terrorist fight , said german and us officials who met in berlin to launch the bilateral agreement on tuesday , march 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal between berlin and washington could be a model for other bilateral agreements us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and us attorney general michael mukasey travelled to berlin to meet with german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries .
the deal will need german parliamentary ratification before becoming law , which schaeuble said he hopes will happen by the end of 2008 . " it is imperative as peace-loving nations we continue to work together to counter the threat of terrorism and to cooperate in this effort using every tool at our disposal , " chertoff said . a direct " hit " the cooperation includes a " hit / no-hit " procedure whereby a country can access another country 's national dna and fingerprint database and determine whether it contains a terror suspect 's data .

at the start of 2008 , many german soccer experts picked hertha to be relegated .
but after a five-game undefeated streak , things are looking up in berlin .
that 's partly down to the work of their swiss coach , lucien favre . even hardcore hertha fans have trouble identifying all the players on the field these days - but that does n't mean they 're unhappy . after falling perilously close to the relegation zone , berlin has earned three wins and two draws in their last five matches , creating a comfortable cushion between themselves and the second division . what 's more , the team is playing arguably their most attacking , attractive soccer since 2000 , when berlin competed in the champions league . when hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness brought in swiss coach lucien favre in the off-season , he announced that 2007/08 would be a transitional year .
that was no exaggeration . gone are brazilian stars like gilberto and marcelinho , as well as problematic young talents such as kevin-prince boateng and ashkan dejagah .
taking their place are decidedly unfamiliar names like rudolf skacel and gojko kacar . so what are the reasons for hertha 's minor renaissance ? from cheese to clockwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre was hired in 2007 to re-route a team headed nowhere one major factor is that lucien favre has put his stamp on a squad often dismissed as uncoachable . favre - an extremely gifted soccer player whose own career was cut short by injury - favors what he calls " polyvalent " players .
what he means primarily are defensively solid midfielders who can advance the ball with one-touch passing . the formula definitely worked at favre 's previous club , fc zurich - they won two swiss league titles . the most obvious benefit of this philosophy for berlin has been defensive stability .
hertha conceded 55 goals in 34 bundesliga games in the 2007 calendar year - whereas after six games in 2008 , they 've let in a mere five . favre has also proven willing to improvise , scrapping his preferred back four for a 3-2-3-1-1 formation to better utilize hertha 's current personnel . berlin 's defense , which had been reminiscent of swiss cheese , is now working with some much-needed clockmaker 's precision . green but game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a revamped hertha squad beat defending champs stuttgart in february on the offensive end , hertha 's improvement under favre is n't as noticeable in the statistics . that 's partially due to the fact that hertha are fielding a young squad .
in their most recent match against dortmund , seven players out of the starting 11 were under the age of 25 . favre 's youngsters often lose their nerve when trying to make a precision last pass or convert opportunities .
in both of their draws this year , hertha were the stronger side and could have won with better finishing . on the plus side , the generational conflict that has plagued berlin in the last few seasons appears to have been laid to rest .
the youngsters respect the veterans ' authority , and experienced players have accepted a seat on the bench without much complaint . " if the players have an intelligence for the game , hierarchy is not a problem , " favre told dw-tv . berlin 's success rate with transfers has also improved since favre got involved .
in addition to skacel and kacar , striker raffael , midfielder fabian lustenberger and defender steve von bergen have all proved worthwhile additions to the squad . " you have to study a player very closely , " favre said .
" and if you make a mistake , you have a player under contract for two , three or even four years .
that 's expensive and creates a problem .
especially for the coach . " the pantelic situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marko pantelic - will he stay or will he go now ?
rarely has the mood been more harmonious at hertha .
indeed the only serious point of friction , for the moment , is between favre and hertha 's top performer , forward marko pantelic . the serbian striker has scored 11 goals this season , but berlin 's tabloids have repeatedly reported that favre considers pantelic too egotistic and would like to ship him off the coach is at pains to deny that . " if you want to get to the top , you have to emphasize the positive , " favre said .
" pantelic is trying hard to improve and play the sort of game i want . " nonetheless , should hertha , still burdened by millions in debt , be offered a hefty transfer fee for the serb , they might be tempted to take the money and extend favre 's rebuilding experiment . dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off , which airs thursday , march 13 , features an extensive interview with hertha coach lucien favre . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hertha conceded 55 goals in 34 bundesliga games in the 2007 calendar year - whereas after six games in 2008 , they 've let in a mere five . favre has also proven willing to improvise , scrapping his preferred back four for a 3-2-3-1-1 formation to better utilize hertha 's current personnel . berlin 's defense , which had been reminiscent of swiss cheese , is now working with some much-needed clockmaker 's precision . green but game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a revamped hertha squad beat defending champs stuttgart in february on the offensive end , hertha 's improvement under favre is n't as noticeable in the statistics . that 's partially due to the fact that hertha are fielding a young squad .
in their most recent match against dortmund , seven players out of the starting 11 were under the age of 25 . favre 's youngsters often lose their nerve when trying to make a precision last pass or convert opportunities .
in both of their draws this year , hertha were the stronger side and could have won with better finishing . on the plus side , the generational conflict that has plagued berlin in the last few seasons appears to have been laid to rest .
the youngsters respect the veterans ' authority , and experienced players have accepted a seat on the bench without much complaint . " if the players have an intelligence for the game , hierarchy is not a problem , " favre told dw-tv . berlin 's success rate with transfers has also improved since favre got involved .
in addition to skacel and kacar , striker raffael , midfielder fabian lustenberger and defender steve von bergen have all proved worthwhile additions to the squad . " you have to study a player very closely , " favre said .
" and if you make a mistake , you have a player under contract for two , three or even four years .
that 's expensive and creates a problem .
especially for the coach . " the pantelic situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marko pantelic - will he stay or will he go now ?
rarely has the mood been more harmonious at hertha .
indeed the only serious point of friction , for the moment , is between favre and hertha 's top performer , forward marko pantelic . the serbian striker has scored 11 goals this season , but berlin 's tabloids have repeatedly reported that favre considers pantelic too egotistic and would like to ship him off the coach is at pains to deny that . " if you want to get to the top , you have to emphasize the positive , " favre said .
" pantelic is trying hard to improve and play the sort of game i want . " nonetheless , should hertha , still burdened by millions in debt , be offered a hefty transfer fee for the serb , they might be tempted to take the money and extend favre 's rebuilding experiment . dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off , which airs thursday , march 13 , features an extensive interview with hertha coach lucien favre . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

zapatero 's policy of engagement in cuba , in particular , could be beneficial for both europe and the us .

" zapatero grew up with a hard-core leftist ideology , so it is not just a matter of being anti-bush , but anti-hypercapitalist america , " he added . no need to rsvp zapatero has never been invited to the white house and even when us secretary of state condoleezza rice paid a courtesy call to madrid last year , policy differences on cuba were a bone of contention . spain , which maintains business interests with havana , wants to engage the communist dictatorship in a dialogue , whereas rice had chided her counterpart , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , for not doing enough to support human rights on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and spain could work to end cuba 's isolation now that castro has stepped down " it will take a new us president in 2009 to restore bilateral relations , " said antonio garrigues walker , honorary president of the spain-us council in madrid .
he emphasized that commercial and cultural exchanges are thriving in spite of the personal animosity between zapatero and bush . common ground in latin america garrigues pointed out that spain has become the fourth-largest foreign investor in the us , after canada , the uk and the netherlands , with much of its financial resources going into hispanic-owned businesses .
the spanish-speaking community is the fastest growing ethnic group in the us . he added that both countries can also find common ground in latin america , where spain has always had strong historical and linguistic ties to its former colonies .
and now that fidel castro has stepped down after nearly 50 years in power , they could even work constructively together to end cuba 's isolation . spain leads eu in latin america , north africa latin america is where spain could lead the european union in foreign policy , according to guenther maihold , a specialist in iberian and latin american affairs at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
zapatero 's policy of engagement in cuba , in particular , could be beneficial for both europe and the us . " another region where spain is influential is north africa , " said maihold , who explained that zapatero has actively sought an eu-wide solution to stem the flow of african migration to europe , which has been particularly problematic for countries on the mediterranean rim . maihold added that zapatero 's consensual approach to foreign policy has worked well for the european union .
unlike aznar , who had tried to elevate spain 's international profile by regular meetings with bush and then british prime minister tony blair , zapatero has generally has been content to take a backseat in the 27-nation bloc , letting france , germany and britain lead the eu . multilateral approach in foreign affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is concerned kosovar secession will encourage militant basques to declare independence other than in kosovo , where spain has come out against recognizing the former serbian province 's independence , madrid is content to let brussels take the driver 's seat in foreign policy issues , according to tom burns maranon , a news commentator and corporate strategist at madrid-based eurocofin . " zapatero is not interested in creating a spanish agenda in foreign affairs , but is keen on working within a multinational framework , " he said . the premier is concerned that kosovo 's recent secession from serbia could encourage spain 's own militant basque movement to declare independence unilaterally , maranon explained . experts disagree , however , on whether domestic or foreign affairs will be the focus of zapatero 's second term .
although over the last ten years spain has experienced unprecedented growth rates that have been largely fuelled by a construction boom , the economy has been slowing down due to the international credit crunch , maranon said . " zapatero could even wind up devoting more time to foreign affairs to deflect from problems at home , " he said . kern of gees , however , said zapatero could become so consumed with the domestic economy that there would be little energy left to focus on spain 's international role . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she stressed that germany would not lift restrictions on troops in the country . the trans-atlantic alliance is a pillar of germany 's foreign and security policy , but it has to move away from purely military thinking , she told a meeting of german armed forces commanders in berlin on monday , march 10 . the chancellor also affirmed germany 's opposition to extending its military role in afghanistan to the volatile south , a move requested by the united states and other nato members . she said her country 's nato-led troops were needed in the relatively peaceful north , where they were engaged mainly in civilian reconstruction projects . nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer told the gathering that afghanistan should not be divided into spheres of responsibility for peacekeeping , combat operations and reconstruction . the country would be won or lost in its entirety , he said . everyone 's a target in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : focusing on reconstruction is n't a guarantee of safety for german troops those building schools in the north are just as much a target of the taliban as those fighting the country 's former fundamentalist rulers in the south , he said . germany has around 3,500 troops serving with the 40,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan as well as a squad of military-surveillance aircraft .
berlin is scheduled to increase the number of troops stationed in afghanistan this summer . merkel said that while nato spoke of a comprehensive approach combining demands to focus on fighting the taliban and the desire for reconstruction there was little to be seen of this strategy in practice . calling for structured and effective coordination , the chancellor said there could be civil reconstruction without security but no security without civil reconstruction . alliance 's internal differences non-governmental organizations should also be included in this comprehensive approach , she added . her remarks highlighted differences within nato on the issue , with the united states believing that fighting insurgency in afghanistan should have priority over reconstruction . us , british , dutch and canadian soldiers have borne the brunt of the fight against the taliban in the south amid reluctance from allies like germany , france and italy to send their troops there . nato expansion questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer has repeatedly asked nato members to lift national troop restrictions merkel also voiced skepticism about nato expansion plans , saying states involved in regional conflicts should not become members of the alliance , an apparent reference to ukraine and georgia . " a country should become a nato member not only when its temporary political leadership is in favor but when a significant percentage of the population supports membership , " merkel said . ukraine and georgia participate in nato 's intensified dialogue program and aspire to become full members one day .
kyiv and tbilisi are expected to use the nato military alliance 's april 2-4 summit in romania to confirm that they are candidates to join the alliance , but their chances of securing a formal invitation seem remote . ukraine 's leaders have asked to join nato 's membership action plan , but lack public support for the move .
in georgia , the public is largely in favor of nato membership , but the alliance was made uneasy by the state of emergency the government imposed in december to end opposition protests . outgoing russian president vladimir putin has criticized nato 's expansion plans , accusing the alliance of trying to replace the united nations . georgia has unresolved disputes with abkhazia and south ossetia , while ukraine has been locked in a clinch with moscow over payments for fuel supplies . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

months of debate over the transport fees that deutsche bahn is charging a traveling holocaust memorial escalated when a jewish community leader called bahn chief hartmut mehdorn " a nazi at heart . " " if mehdorn had held the same position in the third reich he would have arranged the deportation of jews with great conviction , " michael szentei-heise , a jewish community leader said at the opening of the zug der erinnerung , or train of commemoration , exhibition in dusseldorf on sunday , march 9 . the german state railway company responded with a statement tuesday that it was considering legal action . " the remarks are unforgivable and we will ask our lawyers to look into the matter , " the statement said . taxing the train of commemoration the disagreement further escalated tension over transport fees that deutsche bahn is charging the train of commemoration exhibit , for the use of its rails and stations .
housed in a series of old railway cars , the traveling exhibit is set to visit 15 cities before arriving at auschwitz in may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims were often brought by train to nazi death camps initially , deutsche bahn had refused to host the exhibition in its stations , saying that the difficult subject matter , which traces the plight of the 11,400 jewish children who were deported from france to auschwitz between 1942 and 1944 , deserved more than the divided attention of hurried commuters . after drawing sharp criticism for their stance , however , the rail company relented and instead had to charge the exhibition organizers fees that , according to szentei-heise , total of " a laughable 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 166,000 -rrb- . " " head of the new reichsbahn " " we have nothing against serious exhibitions , " a spokesperson for deutsche bahn told the rheinischer post newspaper tuesday .
" but we are obligated by law to collect fees . " referring to mehdorn as the " head of the new reichsbahn , " szentei-heise used rhetoric that harkens back to the nazi era .
the reichsbahn , the wartime predecessor to deutsche bahn , received 25 reichsmarks , or about 25 euros for each child it transported to the camp . the zug der erinnerung leaves dusseldorf for cologne on march 13 and will stop in an additional 14 stations throughout germany before closing at the auschwitz memorial in may . number of survivors falling the debate continued on the same day german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned tuesday against allowing memories of the holocaust to fade as the number of survivors of one of the darkest periods in european history dwindles . " the survivors are leaving us , " he said at a ceremony marking the opening of the secretariat of the task force for international cooperation on holocaust education , remembrance and research -lrb- itf -rrb- .
the natural authority of their voices is fading . " we have to make sure that the memory does not fade into the distance , become more abstract or disappears behind the veil of history , " steinmeier added . the itf was initiated by former swedish prime minister goran persson in 1998 and formally established at a founding conference in stockholm in 2000 .

at the start of 2008 , many german soccer experts picked hertha to be relegated .
but after a five-game undefeated streak , things are looking up in berlin .
that 's partly down to the work of their swiss coach , lucien favre . even hardcore hertha fans have trouble identifying all the players on the field these days - but that does n't mean they 're unhappy . after falling perilously close to the relegation zone , berlin has earned three wins and two draws in their last five matches , creating a comfortable cushion between themselves and the second division . what 's more , the team is playing arguably their most attacking , attractive soccer since 2000 , when berlin competed in the champions league . when hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness brought in swiss coach lucien favre in the off-season , he announced that 2007/08 would be a transitional year .
that was no exaggeration . gone are brazilian stars like gilberto and marcelinho , as well as problematic young talents such as kevin-prince boateng and ashkan dejagah .
taking their place are decidedly unfamiliar names like rudolf skacel and gojko kacar . so what are the reasons for hertha 's minor renaissance ? from cheese to clockwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre was hired in 2007 to re-route a team headed nowhere one major factor is that lucien favre has put his stamp on a squad often dismissed as uncoachable . favre - an extremely gifted soccer player whose own career was cut short by injury - favors what he calls " polyvalent " players .
what he means primarily are defensively solid midfielders who can advance the ball with one-touch passing . the formula definitely worked at favre 's previous club , fc zurich - they won two swiss league titles . the most obvious benefit of this philosophy for berlin has been defensive stability .
hertha conceded 55 goals in 34 bundesliga games in the 2007 calendar year - whereas after six games in 2008 , they 've let in a mere five . favre has also proven willing to improvise , scrapping his preferred back four for a 3-2-3-1-1 formation to better utilize hertha 's current personnel . berlin 's defense , which had been reminiscent of swiss cheese , is now working with some much-needed clockmaker 's precision . green but game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a revamped hertha squad beat defending champs stuttgart in february on the offensive end , hertha 's improvement under favre is n't as noticeable in the statistics . that 's partially due to the fact that hertha are fielding a young squad .
in their most recent match against dortmund , seven players out of the starting 11 were under the age of 25 . favre 's youngsters often lose their nerve when trying to make a precision last pass or convert opportunities .
in both of their draws this year , hertha were the stronger side and could have won with better finishing . on the plus side , the generational conflict that has plagued berlin in the last few seasons appears to have been laid to rest .
the youngsters respect the veterans ' authority , and experienced players have accepted a seat on the bench without much complaint . " if the players have an intelligence for the game , hierarchy is not a problem , " favre told dw-tv . berlin 's success rate with transfers has also improved since favre got involved .
in addition to skacel and kacar , striker raffael , midfielder fabian lustenberger and defender steve von bergen have all proved worthwhile additions to the squad . " you have to study a player very closely , " favre said .
" and if you make a mistake , you have a player under contract for two , three or even four years .
that 's expensive and creates a problem .
especially for the coach . " the pantelic situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marko pantelic - will he stay or will he go now ?
rarely has the mood been more harmonious at hertha .
indeed the only serious point of friction , for the moment , is between favre and hertha 's top performer , forward marko pantelic . the serbian striker has scored 11 goals this season , but berlin 's tabloids have repeatedly reported that favre considers pantelic too egotistic and would like to ship him off the coach is at pains to deny that . " if you want to get to the top , you have to emphasize the positive , " favre said .
" pantelic is trying hard to improve and play the sort of game i want . " nonetheless , should hertha , still burdened by millions in debt , be offered a hefty transfer fee for the serb , they might be tempted to take the money and extend favre 's rebuilding experiment . dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off , which airs thursday , march 13 , features an extensive interview with hertha coach lucien favre . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the start of 2008 , many german soccer experts picked hertha to be relegated .
but after a five-game undefeated streak , things are looking up in berlin .
that 's partly down to the work of their swiss coach , lucien favre . even hardcore hertha fans have trouble identifying all the players on the field these days - but that does n't mean they 're unhappy . after falling perilously close to the relegation zone , berlin has earned three wins and two draws in their last five matches , creating a comfortable cushion between themselves and the second division . what 's more , the team is playing arguably their most attacking , attractive soccer since 2000 , when berlin competed in the champions league . when hertha commercial manager dieter hoeness brought in swiss coach lucien favre in the off-season , he announced that 2007/08 would be a transitional year .
that was no exaggeration . gone are brazilian stars like gilberto and marcelinho , as well as problematic young talents such as kevin-prince boateng and ashkan dejagah .
taking their place are decidedly unfamiliar names like rudolf skacel and gojko kacar . so what are the reasons for hertha 's minor renaissance ? from cheese to clockwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre was hired in 2007 to re-route a team headed nowhere one major factor is that lucien favre has put his stamp on a squad often dismissed as uncoachable . favre - an extremely gifted soccer player whose own career was cut short by injury - favors what he calls " polyvalent " players .
what he means primarily are defensively solid midfielders who can advance the ball with one-touch passing . the formula definitely worked at favre 's previous club , fc zurich - they won two swiss league titles . the most obvious benefit of this philosophy for berlin has been defensive stability .
hertha conceded 55 goals in 34 bundesliga games in the 2007 calendar year - whereas after six games in 2008 , they 've let in a mere five . favre has also proven willing to improvise , scrapping his preferred back four for a 3-2-3-1-1 formation to better utilize hertha 's current personnel . berlin 's defense , which had been reminiscent of swiss cheese , is now working with some much-needed clockmaker 's precision . green but game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a revamped hertha squad beat defending champs stuttgart in february on the offensive end , hertha 's improvement under favre is n't as noticeable in the statistics . that 's partially due to the fact that hertha are fielding a young squad .
in their most recent match against dortmund , seven players out of the starting 11 were under the age of 25 . favre 's youngsters often lose their nerve when trying to make a precision last pass or convert opportunities .
in both of their draws this year , hertha were the stronger side and could have won with better finishing . on the plus side , the generational conflict that has plagued berlin in the last few seasons appears to have been laid to rest .
the youngsters respect the veterans ' authority , and experienced players have accepted a seat on the bench without much complaint . " if the players have an intelligence for the game , hierarchy is not a problem , " favre told dw-tv . berlin 's success rate with transfers has also improved since favre got involved .
in addition to skacel and kacar , striker raffael , midfielder fabian lustenberger and defender steve von bergen have all proved worthwhile additions to the squad . " you have to study a player very closely , " favre said .
" and if you make a mistake , you have a player under contract for two , three or even four years .

washington said it hopes the groundbreaking deal will serve as a model for cooperation with other countries . under the new information sharing agreement , us and german law enforcement officials will have immediate , albeit partial , access to each other 's fingerprint and dna databases . the move will allow authorities to check within minutes if a database contains a suspected terrorist 's personal information .
should a match be found , authorities would then have to submit a request for more detailed information . the effort will speed up the exchange of information and help in the terrorist fight , said german and us officials who met in berlin to launch the bilateral agreement on tuesday , march 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal between berlin and washington could be a model for other bilateral agreements us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and us attorney general michael mukasey travelled to berlin to meet with german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries .
the deal will need german parliamentary ratification before becoming law , which schaeuble said he hopes will happen by the end of 2008 . " it is imperative as peace-loving nations we continue to work together to counter the threat of terrorism and to cooperate in this effort using every tool at our disposal , " chertoff said . a direct " hit " the cooperation includes a " hit / no-hit " procedure whereby a country can access another country 's national dna and fingerprint database and determine whether it contains a terror suspect 's data .
if a " hit " occurs , a formal application can be made for further information . " there is no automated exchange of information as such , but only an automated exchange of information on whether there is information available or not , " schaeuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much information should be shared ?
the exception is dna files , which are not allowed to be automatically shared under us law , schaeuble said . but the plan still raises privacy concerns , germany 's independent privacy commissioner peter schaar said on german public radio deutschlandfunk . schaar gave the example of a protestor who is fingerprinted by german police .
the information might be important to german officials , " but does that give the right to the united states , when i travel there and maybe have the wrong stamp in my passport , to get access to this data ?
i would say no , " schaar said . erosion of civil liberties ? zypries said she was not concerned that the agreement would erode civil liberties . " the data that is transferred can only be used in areas covered by the agreement and not for example as evidence in ongoing criminal cases , " zypries said at the joint news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians have called for greater cooperation " we have ensured that there is an obligation that automated requests for information and replies are recorded ... and , of course , there is an obligation for the data to be destroyed " if it is not used , she said . privacy has become a major issue in germany in recent years , with law enforcement agencies claiming they need more latitude to do their jobs .
while courts have granted partial victories to those who advocate for more electronic surveillance , there 's a sense that courts are sensitive to rights issues . on tuesday , germany 's highest court ruled that a police practice of automatically scanning license plates to check them against a list of suspects violates the country 's constitution .
the court said the surveillance technique was too broad and allowed authorities to do things such as profile an individual 's movements . following a european model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chertoff said the deal includes " robust privacy protection " the deal is modeled on the pruem treaty signed by seven european union countries including germany in 2005 .
the treaty was drawn up following train bombings in madrid by islamist radicals in 2004 which killed 191 people .
the treaty allows law enforcement in signatory countries to compare and exchange data more easily . the us is in preliminary talks with other countries on similar bilateral agreements . " this is a wonderful model , " mukasey said .
" i hope others will follow shortly . " chertoff added that europe and the us needed to cooperate in their efforts fighting international terrorism . " we are indeed fighting a networked , international enemy and , therefore , we have to respond with global networks of our own , " chertoff said .
" today 's agreement between the united states and germany reinforces our collective commitment to combat global terrorism while ensuring robust privacy protection . " germany has n't suffered a major attack the deal comes six months after german authorities made three arrests in an alleged plot to attack us interests and citizens in germany .
us intelligence had passed on information to berlin on the plan . two of the men arrested in september were german converts to islam and a third was turkish .
all had gone to pakistan for training and were stockpiling chemicals to make car bombs .
among the targets were us military installations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washington said it hopes the groundbreaking deal will serve as a model for cooperation with other countries . under the new information sharing agreement , us and german law enforcement officials will have immediate , albeit partial , access to each other 's fingerprint and dna databases . the move will allow authorities to check within minutes if a database contains a suspected terrorist 's personal information .

the deal will need german parliamentary ratification before becoming law , which schaeuble said he hopes will happen by the end of 2008 . " it is imperative as peace-loving nations we continue to work together to counter the threat of terrorism and to cooperate in this effort using every tool at our disposal , " chertoff said . a direct " hit " the cooperation includes a " hit / no-hit " procedure whereby a country can access another country 's national dna and fingerprint database and determine whether it contains a terror suspect 's data .

washington said it hopes the groundbreaking deal will serve as a model for cooperation with other countries . under the new information sharing agreement , us and german law enforcement officials will have immediate , albeit partial , access to each other 's fingerprint and dna databases . the move will allow authorities to check within minutes if a database contains a suspected terrorist 's personal information .
should a match be found , authorities would then have to submit a request for more detailed information . the effort will speed up the exchange of information and help in the terrorist fight , said german and us officials who met in berlin to launch the bilateral agreement on tuesday , march 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal between berlin and washington could be a model for other bilateral agreements us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and us attorney general michael mukasey travelled to berlin to meet with german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries .
the deal will need german parliamentary ratification before becoming law , which schaeuble said he hopes will happen by the end of 2008 . " it is imperative as peace-loving nations we continue to work together to counter the threat of terrorism and to cooperate in this effort using every tool at our disposal , " chertoff said . a direct " hit " the cooperation includes a " hit / no-hit " procedure whereby a country can access another country 's national dna and fingerprint database and determine whether it contains a terror suspect 's data .
if a " hit " occurs , a formal application can be made for further information . " there is no automated exchange of information as such , but only an automated exchange of information on whether there is information available or not , " schaeuble said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much information should be shared ?
the exception is dna files , which are not allowed to be automatically shared under us law , schaeuble said . but the plan still raises privacy concerns , germany 's independent privacy commissioner peter schaar said on german public radio deutschlandfunk . schaar gave the example of a protestor who is fingerprinted by german police .
the information might be important to german officials , " but does that give the right to the united states , when i travel there and maybe have the wrong stamp in my passport , to get access to this data ?
i would say no , " schaar said . erosion of civil liberties ? zypries said she was not concerned that the agreement would erode civil liberties . " the data that is transferred can only be used in areas covered by the agreement and not for example as evidence in ongoing criminal cases , " zypries said at the joint news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians have called for greater cooperation " we have ensured that there is an obligation that automated requests for information and replies are recorded ... and , of course , there is an obligation for the data to be destroyed " if it is not used , she said . privacy has become a major issue in germany in recent years , with law enforcement agencies claiming they need more latitude to do their jobs .
while courts have granted partial victories to those who advocate for more electronic surveillance , there 's a sense that courts are sensitive to rights issues . on tuesday , germany 's highest court ruled that a police practice of automatically scanning license plates to check them against a list of suspects violates the country 's constitution .
the court said the surveillance technique was too broad and allowed authorities to do things such as profile an individual 's movements . following a european model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chertoff said the deal includes " robust privacy protection " the deal is modeled on the pruem treaty signed by seven european union countries including germany in 2005 .
the treaty was drawn up following train bombings in madrid by islamist radicals in 2004 which killed 191 people .
the treaty allows law enforcement in signatory countries to compare and exchange data more easily . the us is in preliminary talks with other countries on similar bilateral agreements . " this is a wonderful model , " mukasey said .
" i hope others will follow shortly . " chertoff added that europe and the us needed to cooperate in their efforts fighting international terrorism . " we are indeed fighting a networked , international enemy and , therefore , we have to respond with global networks of our own , " chertoff said .
" today 's agreement between the united states and germany reinforces our collective commitment to combat global terrorism while ensuring robust privacy protection . " germany has n't suffered a major attack the deal comes six months after german authorities made three arrests in an alleged plot to attack us interests and citizens in germany .
us intelligence had passed on information to berlin on the plan . two of the men arrested in september were german converts to islam and a third was turkish .
all had gone to pakistan for training and were stockpiling chemicals to make car bombs .
among the targets were us military installations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

though the imbalance could hurt the economy , some investors apparently see blue skies ahead . the euro 's rise on foreign exchange markets could endanger economic growth in the euro zone , the european union 's slovenian presidency said on tuesday , march 11 , as the euro hit a record high just shy of $ 1.55 . " of course this is a problem that we are witnessing on a daily basis , " slovenia 's finance minister andrej bajuk said in an internet broadcast .
" we have come to the conclusion that these movements may not have a positive effect when it comes to economic growth and development . " the value of the euro , the currency in 15 european countries , has continued to climb as experts say the us economy slips toward a recession . " we believe that exchange rates should ... reflect the realities of the economy , " bajuk said .
" we also believe the foundations of the european economy are solid and wholesome . " the european central bank chief jean-claude trichet had on monday said he was " concerned by the excessive exchange rate fluctuations . "
the eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia also said currency markets were among his key concerns . " the excessive volatility indeed is a matter of concern , " he told journalists on monday . german economy to survive turmoil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking up , some economists say tuesday 's jump followed the announcement of better-than-expected investor sentiment in germany . " experts are more optimistic for the growth of the us economy in the next six months , " the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said in a statement accompanying its monthly report .
" moreover , they expect the dollar to appreciate versus the euro .
this should benefit export-oriented sectors of the german economy . " zew 's economic indicator for germany rose 7.5 points in march to minus 32.0 points after plummeting to minus 39.5 in february , the lowest point since january 1993 .
economists had predicted it would drop to below minus 40 points . " the optimism of the financial analysts is presumably based on the hope that the peak of the financial market crisis will be overcome in half a year and that business dynamics will not weaken more strongly than expected to date , " zew president wolfgang franz said upon the report 's release . though the financial experts surveyed seem to feel good about the near future , they gave a more negative assessment of the current situation in germany .
that indicator dropped by 1.6 points to 32.1 points due to the country 's weak economic growth figures . interest rates to remain stable , exports rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro has continued to reach new highs against the dollar the euro 's leap to nearly $ 1.55 also followed statements tuesday by axel weber , head of germany 's central bank , and a member of the european central bank 's rate-setting council , who ruled out a drop in interest rates . a high euro serves as a double-edged sword for the euro-zone economies .
while essential imports like oil , which is typically priced in dollars , become cheaper , its exports become more expensive abroad , making them less competitive on the global market . since the euro has been on the rise , germany has continued running up large trade surpluses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 11.03.2008 berlin launches image campaign with new slogan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be partying - berlin is fun regardless of its slogan " be berlin " - that 's the message the german capital wants to project to the world .
the catchphrase is part of a major publicity drive , but some people are asking : what would it mean to be berlin ? be successful berlin mayor klaus wowereit officially launched the slogan on tuesday , march 11 , as part of a 10.6 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- marketing initiative to encourage tourism and enhance the city 's image .
" with the branding campaign , the berlin senate wants to project berlin 's image outside the city , " woworeit said at the launch , " so that more people come visit us , more companies create new jobs here , and scientific , cultural and social richness of the city becomes easier to experience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be mayorial - wowereit 's previous phrase for berlin was " poor but sexy " the catchphrase vaguely echoes john f. kennedy 's " ich bin ein berliner " speech during the cold war and follows in the trend of cities using advertising slogans to brand themselves .
probably the most famous example is the " i love new york " campaign of the late 1970s .
more recently , the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg landed a hit with the slogan " we can do everything but speak proper german . "
berlin is germany 's top destination for tourists , attracting more than 8 million visitors and earning between 8 and 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12-14.5 billion -rrb- from them annually .
that 's a business berlin wants to expand .
be stranded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be building - construction sites are still all over the capital but the catchphrase has left many people scratching their heads as to what precisely one would be , if one were to choose to " be berlin " - all the more so since the debt-ridden capital is known just as much for being chaotic as it is for being creative .
" all berlin residents should be warned … that the imperative is meant literally , " wrote berlin columnist harald martenstein ahead of the official launch .
" when the first ' be berlin ' billboards are erected and the entire city populace stops bathing , quits their jobs and throws all their money out the window , saying that the berlin senate told them to do so , we 'll see we 've shot ourselves in the foot . "
indeed , tourists currently visiting berlin are getting a taste for just how disorderly the german capital can be .
the city 's public-transport workers are currently on strike , closing down the vast majority of subways , streetcars and busses and leaving visitors and natives alike to get around the huge metropolis as best they can .
be sarcastic bildunterschrift : be fluffy - some say knut could have come up with a better idea and berliners themselves - at least to judge from the blogs - seem underwhelmed by the campaign , greeting it with their characteristic sarcasm .
some have scoffed that the slogan sounds like a stutter .
others have quipped that a better catchphrase would be " bi berlin , " playing on the city 's tradition of tolerance .
a few berliners have complained that the campaign is in english , not german .
and a great many have speculated about how much the perennially cash-strapped capital paid for the three syllables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be broke - berlin 's debts have meant cuts in services like education " what did those two words cost ? " asked one blogger on the online page of the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" i can only shake my head . "
black humor was another response .
" the money has to be gotten rid of , " wrote a blogger on a page devoted to the capital .
" if it 's left lying around , someone will trip over it .
it 's better to spend it immediately .
then it 's out of the way , and everything 's hunky-dory . "
and with berlin already well known internationally for its nightlife and culture , it 's debatable whether the city really needed help on this score from pr experts .

the catchphrase is part of a major publicity drive , but some people are asking : what would it mean to be berlin ? be successful berlin mayor klaus wowereit officially launched the slogan on tuesday , march 11 , as part of a 10.6 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- marketing initiative to encourage tourism and enhance the city 's image .
" with the branding campaign , the berlin senate wants to project berlin 's image outside the city , " woworeit said at the launch , " so that more people come visit us , more companies create new jobs here , and scientific , cultural and social richness of the city becomes easier to experience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be mayorial - wowereit 's previous phrase for berlin was " poor but sexy " the catchphrase vaguely echoes john f. kennedy 's " ich bin ein berliner " speech during the cold war and follows in the trend of cities using advertising slogans to brand themselves .
probably the most famous example is the " i love new york " campaign of the late 1970s .
more recently , the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg landed a hit with the slogan " we can do everything but speak proper german . "
berlin is germany 's top destination for tourists , attracting more than 8 million visitors and earning between 8 and 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12-14.5 billion -rrb- from them annually .
that 's a business berlin wants to expand .
be stranded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be building - construction sites are still all over the capital but the catchphrase has left many people scratching their heads as to what precisely one would be , if one were to choose to " be berlin " - all the more so since the debt-ridden capital is known just as much for being chaotic as it is for being creative .
" all berlin residents should be warned … that the imperative is meant literally , " wrote berlin columnist harald martenstein ahead of the official launch .
" when the first ' be berlin ' billboards are erected and the entire city populace stops bathing , quits their jobs and throws all their money out the window , saying that the berlin senate told them to do so , we 'll see we 've shot ourselves in the foot . "
indeed , tourists currently visiting berlin are getting a taste for just how disorderly the german capital can be .
the city 's public-transport workers are currently on strike , closing down the vast majority of subways , streetcars and busses and leaving visitors and natives alike to get around the huge metropolis as best they can .
be sarcastic bildunterschrift : be fluffy - some say knut could have come up with a better idea and berliners themselves - at least to judge from the blogs - seem underwhelmed by the campaign , greeting it with their characteristic sarcasm .
some have scoffed that the slogan sounds like a stutter .
others have quipped that a better catchphrase would be " bi berlin , " playing on the city 's tradition of tolerance .
a few berliners have complained that the campaign is in english , not german .
and a great many have speculated about how much the perennially cash-strapped capital paid for the three syllables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be broke - berlin 's debts have meant cuts in services like education " what did those two words cost ? " asked one blogger on the online page of the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" i can only shake my head . "
black humor was another response .
" the money has to be gotten rid of , " wrote a blogger on a page devoted to the capital .
" if it 's left lying around , someone will trip over it .
it 's better to spend it immediately .
then it 's out of the way , and everything 's hunky-dory . "
and with berlin already well known internationally for its nightlife and culture , it 's debatable whether the city really needed help on this score from pr experts .

" " if mehdorn had held the same position in the third reich he would have arranged the deportation of jews with great conviction , " michael szentei-heise , a jewish community leader said at the opening of the zug der erinnerung , or train of commemoration , exhibition in dusseldorf on sunday , march 9 . the german state railway company responded with a statement tuesday that it was considering legal action . " the remarks are unforgivable and we will ask our lawyers to look into the matter , " the statement said . taxing the train of commemoration the disagreement further escalated tension over transport fees that deutsche bahn is charging the train of commemoration exhibit , for the use of its rails and stations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 11.03.2008 spain 's zapatero favors low profile in foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero is usually willing to let brussels lead when it comes to foreign policy decisions reelected in circumstances similar to in 2004 , zapatero will likely demure to the eu when it comes to international politics .
except in the bloc 's relations with latin america , where he can take a lead role . it was deja-vu in spain on sunday , march 9 . socialist party leader jose luis zapatero , 47 , was reelected in an election with high voter turnout that was close to the record participation levels of 75 percent back in 2004 .
he had also scored a second victory over the same conservative opponent , mariano rajoy . there had even been a terrorist attack days before the election , when isaias carrasco , a municipal socialist legislator was shot dead , allegedly by basque separatists .
exactly four years ago , on march 11 , islamic terror attacks on madrid 's commuter trains had killed 191 people , and were followed by an election that had shocked spanish voters into ousting the incumbent right of center people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- in favor of the relatively unknown zapatero . virtually all spaniards agree that had 11-m , which is spanish shorthand for the madrid attacks , not occurred days before the 2004 elections , zapatero would not be serving two terms today . reversed us relationship in his first term , zapatero had taken spain in a radically different direction from his pp predecessor , jose maria aznar , especially in foreign policy .
aznar had been closely allied with us president george w. bush and had involved spain in the iraq war , which was opposed by 90 percent of spaniards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's aznar -lrb- center -rrb- and britain 's blair -lrb- left -rrb- had a privileged partnership with bush zapatero immediately reversed aznar 's policy and realigned spain with the france and germany in terms of the iraq war .
he fulfilled his campaign pledge of unilaterally withdrawing spanish troops from an international brigade - a move that angered the bush administration and sent us-spain relations on a downward spiral . " bush had been a convenient cover for expressing an ideological antipathy towards the us , " said soeren kern , a german fellow for transatlantic relations at the strategic studies group -lrb- gees -rrb- in madrid .
" even many socialists believe that zapatero has taken spain too far to the left . " zapatero grew up with a hard-core leftist ideology , so it is not just a matter of being anti-bush , but anti-hypercapitalist america , " he added . no need to rsvp zapatero has never been invited to the white house and even when us secretary of state condoleezza rice paid a courtesy call to madrid last year , policy differences on cuba were a bone of contention . spain , which maintains business interests with havana , wants to engage the communist dictatorship in a dialogue , whereas rice had chided her counterpart , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , for not doing enough to support human rights on the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and spain could work to end cuba 's isolation now that castro has stepped down " it will take a new us president in 2009 to restore bilateral relations , " said antonio garrigues walker , honorary president of the spain-us council in madrid .
he emphasized that commercial and cultural exchanges are thriving in spite of the personal animosity between zapatero and bush . common ground in latin america garrigues pointed out that spain has become the fourth-largest foreign investor in the us , after canada , the uk and the netherlands , with much of its financial resources going into hispanic-owned businesses .
the spanish-speaking community is the fastest growing ethnic group in the us . he added that both countries can also find common ground in latin america , where spain has always had strong historical and linguistic ties to its former colonies .
and now that fidel castro has stepped down after nearly 50 years in power , they could even work constructively together to end cuba 's isolation . spain leads eu in latin america , north africa latin america is where spain could lead the european union in foreign policy , according to guenther maihold , a specialist in iberian and latin american affairs at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
zapatero 's policy of engagement in cuba , in particular , could be beneficial for both europe and the us . " another region where spain is influential is north africa , " said maihold , who explained that zapatero has actively sought an eu-wide solution to stem the flow of african migration to europe , which has been particularly problematic for countries on the mediterranean rim . maihold added that zapatero 's consensual approach to foreign policy has worked well for the european union .
unlike aznar , who had tried to elevate spain 's international profile by regular meetings with bush and then british prime minister tony blair , zapatero has generally has been content to take a backseat in the 27-nation bloc , letting france , germany and britain lead the eu . multilateral approach in foreign affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is concerned kosovar secession will encourage militant basques to declare independence other than in kosovo , where spain has come out against recognizing the former serbian province 's independence , madrid is content to let brussels take the driver 's seat in foreign policy issues , according to tom burns maranon , a news commentator and corporate strategist at madrid-based eurocofin . " zapatero is not interested in creating a spanish agenda in foreign affairs , but is keen on working within a multinational framework , " he said . the premier is concerned that kosovo 's recent secession from serbia could encourage spain 's own militant basque movement to declare independence unilaterally , maranon explained . experts disagree , however , on whether domestic or foreign affairs will be the focus of zapatero 's second term .
although over the last ten years spain has experienced unprecedented growth rates that have been largely fuelled by a construction boom , the economy has been slowing down due to the international credit crunch , maranon said . " zapatero could even wind up devoting more time to foreign affairs to deflect from problems at home , " he said . kern of gees , however , said zapatero could become so consumed with the domestic economy that there would be little energy left to focus on spain 's international role . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spanish-speaking community is the fastest growing ethnic group in the us . he added that both countries can also find common ground in latin america , where spain has always had strong historical and linguistic ties to its former colonies .
and now that fidel castro has stepped down after nearly 50 years in power , they could even work constructively together to end cuba 's isolation . spain leads eu in latin america , north africa latin america is where spain could lead the european union in foreign policy , according to guenther maihold , a specialist in iberian and latin american affairs at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
zapatero 's policy of engagement in cuba , in particular , could be beneficial for both europe and the us . " another region where spain is influential is north africa , " said maihold , who explained that zapatero has actively sought an eu-wide solution to stem the flow of african migration to europe , which has been particularly problematic for countries on the mediterranean rim . maihold added that zapatero 's consensual approach to foreign policy has worked well for the european union .
unlike aznar , who had tried to elevate spain 's international profile by regular meetings with bush and then british prime minister tony blair , zapatero has generally has been content to take a backseat in the 27-nation bloc , letting france , germany and britain lead the eu . multilateral approach in foreign affairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is concerned kosovar secession will encourage militant basques to declare independence other than in kosovo , where spain has come out against recognizing the former serbian province 's independence , madrid is content to let brussels take the driver 's seat in foreign policy issues , according to tom burns maranon , a news commentator and corporate strategist at madrid-based eurocofin . " zapatero is not interested in creating a spanish agenda in foreign affairs , but is keen on working within a multinational framework , " he said . the premier is concerned that kosovo 's recent secession from serbia could encourage spain 's own militant basque movement to declare independence unilaterally , maranon explained . experts disagree , however , on whether domestic or foreign affairs will be the focus of zapatero 's second term .
although over the last ten years spain has experienced unprecedented growth rates that have been largely fuelled by a construction boom , the economy has been slowing down due to the international credit crunch , maranon said . " zapatero could even wind up devoting more time to foreign affairs to deflect from problems at home , " he said . kern of gees , however , said zapatero could become so consumed with the domestic economy that there would be little energy left to focus on spain 's international role . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 11.03.2008 berlin launches image campaign with new slogan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be partying - berlin is fun regardless of its slogan " be berlin " - that 's the message the german capital wants to project to the world .
the catchphrase is part of a major publicity drive , but some people are asking : what would it mean to be berlin ? be successful berlin mayor klaus wowereit officially launched the slogan on tuesday , march 11 , as part of a 10.6 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- marketing initiative to encourage tourism and enhance the city 's image .
" with the branding campaign , the berlin senate wants to project berlin 's image outside the city , " woworeit said at the launch , " so that more people come visit us , more companies create new jobs here , and scientific , cultural and social richness of the city becomes easier to experience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be mayorial - wowereit 's previous phrase for berlin was " poor but sexy " the catchphrase vaguely echoes john f. kennedy 's " ich bin ein berliner " speech during the cold war and follows in the trend of cities using advertising slogans to brand themselves .
probably the most famous example is the " i love new york " campaign of the late 1970s .
more recently , the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg landed a hit with the slogan " we can do everything but speak proper german . "
berlin is germany 's top destination for tourists , attracting more than 8 million visitors and earning between 8 and 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12-14.5 billion -rrb- from them annually .
that 's a business berlin wants to expand .
be stranded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be building - construction sites are still all over the capital but the catchphrase has left many people scratching their heads as to what precisely one would be , if one were to choose to " be berlin " - all the more so since the debt-ridden capital is known just as much for being chaotic as it is for being creative .
" all berlin residents should be warned … that the imperative is meant literally , " wrote berlin columnist harald martenstein ahead of the official launch .
" when the first ' be berlin ' billboards are erected and the entire city populace stops bathing , quits their jobs and throws all their money out the window , saying that the berlin senate told them to do so , we 'll see we 've shot ourselves in the foot . "
indeed , tourists currently visiting berlin are getting a taste for just how disorderly the german capital can be .
the city 's public-transport workers are currently on strike , closing down the vast majority of subways , streetcars and busses and leaving visitors and natives alike to get around the huge metropolis as best they can .
be sarcastic bildunterschrift : be fluffy - some say knut could have come up with a better idea and berliners themselves - at least to judge from the blogs - seem underwhelmed by the campaign , greeting it with their characteristic sarcasm .
some have scoffed that the slogan sounds like a stutter .
others have quipped that a better catchphrase would be " bi berlin , " playing on the city 's tradition of tolerance .
a few berliners have complained that the campaign is in english , not german .
and a great many have speculated about how much the perennially cash-strapped capital paid for the three syllables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be broke - berlin 's debts have meant cuts in services like education " what did those two words cost ? " asked one blogger on the online page of the tagesspiegel newspaper .
" i can only shake my head . "
black humor was another response .
" the money has to be gotten rid of , " wrote a blogger on a page devoted to the capital .
" if it 's left lying around , someone will trip over it .
it 's better to spend it immediately .
then it 's out of the way , and everything 's hunky-dory . "
and with berlin already well known internationally for its nightlife and culture , it 's debatable whether the city really needed help on this score from pr experts .
in the words of one foreign tourist to ap news agency : " i do n't want to be berlin .
i wanted to come here to see the galleries . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mr ban said the trend would hinder progress towards the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , which aim to halve extreme poverty by 2015 .
the un world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- and other agencies may be forced to ration food aid , he said in a bbc interview .
he said shortages might be eased by a " green revolution " to transform farming methods in africa .
global food prices have risen by 40 % in nine months and food reserves are at their lowest for 30 years .
the wfp is facing a $ 500m -lrb- £ 248m -rrb- shortfall in its attempts to feed 73 million people this year .
' political challenge ' mr ban said that " many countries in particular in africa they now have to pay double or triple the price for their bread , " and warned that this would lead to increased malnutrition .
" this will all affect our mdg programmes - i am very much seriously concerned about this , " he said .
the change has been blamed on poor harvests , population growth , rising energy and grain prices , the effects of climate change , and a shift to biofuel crops .
although one un official has called the increasing use of crops for fuel rather than food a crime against humanity , mr ban said there was a need to balance the positive and negative aspects of biofuels .
among possible solutions , he said that " there is broad consensus that more resources should be provided to help an african green revolution " .

the shuttle launched in darkness at 0228 local time -lrb- 0628 gmt -rrb- .
the 16-day flight is the longest shuttle mission to the iss .
endeavour is taking the first section of a japanese space lab to the iss , as construction work continues .
the seven-strong crew will also install a two-armed robot built in canada .
during 12 days spent on the iss , the shuttle crew will unload a storage and equipment module for japan 's space laboratory , kibo , helped by the three long-term residents of the space station .
japanese kibo laboratory cost $ 2.4bn -lrb- £ 1.2bn -rrb- to build kibo is japanese for " hope " main section launches in may the final part will fly next year they will also fit a pair of robotic arms to the station 's crane .
the canadian-built arms , which are each 3.35m -lrb- 11ft -rrb- long , are designed to fit and service components as small as a phone book or as large as a telephone booth .
working like a mechanic in space , the robot , known as dextre , can pivot at the waist .
its shoulders support two identical arms with complex joints that allow for freedom of movement .
astronauts also plan to test a heat-shield repair technique designed after the 2003 columbia accident , during one of five planned space walks .
the japanese lab complex is the latest research addition to the $ 100bn -lrb- £ 50bn -rrb- iss project .
europe 's columbus space lab arrived last month , joining nasa 's own research base at the station , a module called destiny that has been in space since 2001 .
after endeavour leaves the iss , europe 's first cargo ship , an unmanned automated transfer vehicle called jules verne , will get its chance to dock .
the atv was launched from europe 's spaceport in french guiana on saturday night .
it will orbit near the station during the shuttle 's visit , ready to move into position in early april .
after endeavour 's flight there are only 11 shuttle flights before the orbiters are retired .
preliminary launch dates for shuttles in the rest of 2008:25 may , discovery : to loft the second and main component of the japanese kibo lab together with its exterior robot arm 28 august , atlantis : a flight to service the hubble space telescope 16 october , endeavour : a cargo flight to the iss using the multi-purpose logistics module in endeavour 's payload bay 4 december , discovery : taking up the fourth starboard " backbone " segment for the iss ; and the fourth set of solar arrays and batteries because atlantis will not be able to reach the space station if it gets into trouble , or is damaged , on its hubble flight , the endeavour orbiter will be made ready on the pad for a rescue mission in case it is needed .
launch dates for the remaining seven flights in 2009/10 are under review .
the crew of the space station is expected to rise from three to six in mid-2009 .

the changes are needed to make the network viable , says post office ltd .
the proposals also include establishing 24 outreach service points to replace some branches .
conservatives and liberal democrats criticised the plans which could see branches in montgomeryshire , ceredigion and brecon and radnorshire areas close .
the announcement follows the decision to close 29 branches in cardiff , bridgend , vale of glamorgan and valleys .
a decision on 25 threatened branches across the newport and gwent valleys has yet to be made .
the proposals for mid wales will leave 153 post offices - five branches in towns and 148 in rural areas .

the company says more than 98.8 % of the region 's 200,000 population will either see no change or will remain within one mile , by road , of an alternative branch .
the new outreach service points will provide post office services for a designated number of hours per week in that particular area and could be located within a mobile van , a host shop or village hall .
in very small communities , a home service could be provided whereby a sub postmaster delivers a reduced range of products and services which can be ordered over the telephone .
under the plans , 89.3 % of the area 's population will retain their existing post office branch , said post office ltd .
kirsty williams am and roger williams mp have petitions opposed to closures where there is a change , 9.5 % would have access to post office services within one mile by road distance to the nearest alternative branch .
post office ltd said it had consulted with watchdog postwatch and all the local authorities within the area to come up with the plans .
it said it had considered geographical , public transport and local population and economic issues .
but the liberal democrat mp and am for the brecon and radnorshire area - roger williams and kirsty williams - said the announcement was " shattering " and " devastating " .
mr williams said the pair would be meeting all the affected town and community councils in order to build up individual cases against each of the proposed closures .
meanwhile , conservatives said the mobile outreach units would result in a far more limited service .
" people will be forced to fit around a timetable for accessing post office services , " said nick bourne , am for mid and west wales and leader of the welsh conservatives .
" this is incredibly restrictive for those who work and the elderly .
local elections " while the use of outreach services like mobile units is to be welcomed , it is a very poor substitute for the real thing . "
the normal consultation period of six weeks has been extended by three weeks and three days to allow for the local elections and the easter holidays .
the public can have their say on the matter until 19 may .
steve geraty , post office ltd 's network development manager for wales , said : " taking the decision to close any post office branch is always very difficult and we know will cause concern to many of our customers .
" we want to ensure that everyone who uses , relies on , or has any concern with post office services is both fully aware of the proposed changes and able to give views on them . "
the plans are part of a wider restructuring of post office services throughout the uk .
altogether , 2,500 post offices - a fifth of those left - are to close by 2009 .

the proposals for mid wales will leave 153 post offices - five branches in towns and 148 in rural areas .
closure list llandrindod wells : tremont road llandrindod wells : ridgebourne , grosvenor road brecon : westend service station , church street , llanfaes brecon : pendre spar store , bryndewinton presteigne : evenjobb blaenannerch : mobile service by bt telephone box , a487 llandysul : glynarthen lampeter : abermeurig mobile service lampeter : talsarn mobile service , b4337 main road swansea : cwmgiedd , 50-52 heol giedd , ystradgynlais newtown 4 oakfield terrace , llanidloes road newtown : garth owen aberystwyth : llanfarian the region currently has 166 post offices .
the company says more than 98.8 % of the region 's 200,000 population will either see no change or will remain within one mile , by road , of an alternative branch .
the new outreach service points will provide post office services for a designated number of hours per week in that particular area and could be located within a mobile van , a host shop or village hall .
in very small communities , a home service could be provided whereby a sub postmaster delivers a reduced range of products and services which can be ordered over the telephone .
under the plans , 89.3 % of the area 's population will retain their existing post office branch , said post office ltd .
where there is a change , 9.5 % would have access to post office services within one mile by road distance to the nearest alternative branch .
post office ltd said it had consulted with watchdog postwatch and all the local authorities within the area to come up with the plans .
it said it had considered geographical , public transport and local population and economic issues .
but the liberal democrat mp and am for the brecon and radnorshire area - roger williams and kirsty williams - said the announcement was " shattering " and " devastating " .
mr williams said the pair would be meeting all the affected town and community councils in order to build up individual cases against each of the proposed closures .
meanwhile , conservatives said the mobile outreach units would result in a far more limited service .
" people will be forced to fit around a timetable for accessing post office services , " said nick bourne , am for mid and west wales and leader of the welsh conservatives .
" this is incredibly restrictive for those who work and the elderly .
local elections " while the use of outreach services like mobile units is to be welcomed , it is a very poor substitute for the real thing . "
the normal consultation period of six weeks has been extended by three weeks and three days to allow for the local elections and the easter holidays .
the public can have their say on the matter until 19 may .
steve geraty , post office ltd 's network development manager for wales , said : " taking the decision to close any post office branch is always very difficult and we know will cause concern to many of our customers .
" we want to ensure that everyone who uses , relies on , or has any concern with post office services is both fully aware of the proposed changes and able to give views on them . "
the plans are part of a wider restructuring of post office services throughout the uk .
altogether , 2,500 post offices - a fifth of those left - are to close by 2009 .

speaking before the rally , mr jones said : " i 'm not saying that that referendum should be happening today .

cars are the curse of tehran , but they represent freedom for the millions of people who live here .
this is a huge , sprawling city , which has crept steadily northwards into the magnificent alburz mountains and southwards across the desert plain .
as one of the world 's main oil producers , iran has yet to grasp the full threat of global warming .
so every hour throughout the day is rush hour , and every intersection seems blocked .
khatami landslides i 've been coming to iran for 30 years , and have watched the gridlock grow worse and worse in the streets - and also in the country 's politics . "
real power rests , not with president or parliament , but with unelected committees of religious leaders " for years , the reformists - who want both closer ties with the west and an end to the intrusive controls over people 's lives - have battled it out with the conservatives who want to keep to the strict islamic norms .
in the presidential elections of 1997 and 2001 , the quiet , unexciting figure of mohammed khatami won enormous landslides , getting more than 80 % of the vote on both occasions .
but in iran , vox populi is not vox dei .
real power rests not with president or parliament , but with unelected committees of religious leaders who can and do veto any policy they dislike .
the conservatives also control large sections of the police as well as other organs of the iranian state .
and when , back in 2001 , my colleagues and i tried to film the public demonstrations in support of the newly re-elected president khatami , we were attacked and arrested .
one of the special policemen who assaulted us tried to poke my eye out with his finger .
in which other country would foreign television crews be beaten up for filming the celebrations when a new president has been elected ?
it was a small example of iran 's political gridlock .
and there were far more important examples to come .
reformist , of sorts president khatami 's second term in office produced very little in terms of new legislation , or opening to the outside world .
he could do almost nothing .
the presidential election of 2005 brought the extraordinary , unpredictable figure of mahmoud ahmadinejad to power , largely because few people wanted his opponent , ali-akbar hashemi-rafsanjani , back in power .
mr rafsanjani was a sort of reformist , but he had been deeply unpopular when he served as president before .
mr ahmadinejad swept in largely by default .
ever since , the conservatives have been in the ascendant .
and although the economy is shaky and inflation is disturbingly high , there seems to be little serious opposition to them .
and so many people who instinctively support the reformist cause will stay away from the polls .
gloomy voters going round the vast , cavernous grand bazaar , which is as crowded with shoppers as the roads are crowded with cars , i came across people again and again who believed that voting in friday 's parliamentary elections was a waste of time .
" this will just be a sham election , " one young man said .
even the reformist candidates i spoke to seemed gloomy about their chances .
" we will do our best , but you know ... " said one woman .
so the conservatives are likely to do well , and president ahmadinejad 's power will be reinforced .
there are only a few countries in this region where the voters can change their government at the ballot-box .
iran is far from being a full democracy , but it is a great deal more democratic than almost any country in the arab world or central asia .
but if large numbers of people here decide that nothing will change if they vote , then voting becomes just a formality .
the political gridlock may have broken , but a new one will soon take its place .

cars are the curse of tehran , but they represent freedom for the millions of people who live here .
this is a huge , sprawling city , which has crept steadily northwards into the magnificent alburz mountains and southwards across the desert plain .
as one of the world 's main oil producers , iran has yet to grasp the full threat of global warming .
so every hour throughout the day is rush hour , and every intersection seems blocked .
khatami landslides i 've been coming to iran for 30 years , and have watched the gridlock grow worse and worse in the streets - and also in the country 's politics .
real power rests , not with president or parliament , but with unelected committees of religious leaders for years , the reformists - who want both closer ties with the west and an end to the intrusive controls over people 's lives - have battled it out with the conservatives who want to keep to the strict islamic norms .
in the presidential elections of 1997 and 2001 , the quiet , unexciting figure of mohammed khatami won enormous landslides , getting more than 80 % of the vote on both occasions .
but in iran , vox populi is not vox dei .
real power rests not with president or parliament , but with unelected committees of religious leaders who can and do veto any policy they dislike .
the conservatives also control large sections of the police as well as other organs of the iranian state .
and when , back in 2001 , my colleagues and i tried to film the public demonstrations in support of the newly re-elected president khatami , we were attacked and arrested .
one of the special policemen who assaulted us tried to poke my eye out with his finger .
in which other country would foreign television crews be beaten up for filming the celebrations when a new president has been elected ?
it was a small example of iran 's political gridlock .
and there were far more important examples to come .
reformist , of sorts president khatami 's second term in office produced very little in terms of new legislation , or opening to the outside world .
mr ahmadinejad was swept to power in 2005 largely by default he could do almost nothing .
the presidential election of 2005 brought the extraordinary , unpredictable figure of mahmoud ahmadinejad to power , largely because few people wanted his opponent , ali-akbar hashemi-rafsanjani , back in power .
mr rafsanjani was a sort of reformist , but he had been deeply unpopular when he served as president before .
mr ahmadinejad swept in largely by default .
ever since , the conservatives have been in the ascendant .
and although the economy is shaky and inflation is disturbingly high , there seems to be little serious opposition to them .
and so many people who instinctively support the reformist cause will stay away from the polls .
gloomy voters going round the vast , cavernous grand bazaar , which is as crowded with shoppers as the roads are crowded with cars , i came across people again and again who believed that voting in friday 's parliamentary elections was a waste of time .
posters line tehran 's streets as the muted campaign gets under way " this will just be a sham election , " one young man said .
even the reformist candidates i spoke to seemed gloomy about their chances .
" we will do our best , but you know ... " said one woman .
so the conservatives are likely to do well , and president ahmadinejad 's power will be reinforced .
there are only a few countries in this region where the voters can change their government at the ballot-box .
iran is far from being a full democracy , but it is a great deal more democratic than almost any country in the arab world or central asia .
but if large numbers of people here decide that nothing will change if they vote , then voting becomes just a formality .
the political gridlock may have broken , but a new one will soon take its place .

the us national cancer institute found low levels of dormant hiv in patients seven years after they started - and responded well to - standard therapy .
the finding confirms patients must take drugs indefinitely , and that any break runs the risk of rekindling infection .
the study features in proceedings of the national academy of sciences .
people with hiv need to take treatment indefinitely because current drugs can not reach this pool of dormant virus keith alcorn nam the researchers followed 40 patients infected with hiv for seven years .
doctors do not usually record infection levels once the number of hiv particles falls below 50 per ml of blood .
however , the nci team used highly sensitive equipment to measure infection levels below this threshold .
they found that the virus was still present at low levels in 77 % of the patients .
the research suggests that although potent antiretroviral therapy can suppress hiv infection to almost undetectable levels , it can not eradicate the virus .
renewed risk the researchers said that even though levels of the virus that remain are low , they are high enough to rekindle infection if treatment is interrupted .
the risk of infecting others is low , but can not be ruled out .
they believe hiv may be harboured by cd4 + cells , which play a role in the immune system .
these cells are most likely infected before therapy was initiated and the amount of virus they produce is small .
researcher dr sarah palmer said : " it is extremely important that new drugs are developed to eradicate hiv infection as the side effects associated with long-term hiv treatment can be severe . "
she also warned that failing to take prescribed medication raised the risk that hiv could begin to develop resistance , rendering future treatment less effective .
keith alcorn , of the hiv information service nam , said scientists were looking at approaches to treatment that could flush out hiv from cells .
he said : " this research shows that , for the time being , people with hiv need to take treatment indefinitely because current drugs can not reach this pool of dormant virus .
" if treatment stops , this pool of virus provides the basis for a rapid rebound in virus levels . "
mary lima , a treatment advisor at the hiv charity terrence higgins trust , said : " this study only highlights the complexity of hiv and why it 's so difficult for us to find a cure .
" it 's important we find out as much as possible about how hiv acts over long periods of time , so we can continue to develop new treatment strategies to tackle it .
in order to keep people with hiv well for longer , we need to attack the virus at all stages . "

page last updated at 08:33 gmt , tuesday , 11 march 2008 e-mail this to a friend printable version siberian prison 's beauty pageant by maria yatskova this world , bbc two women inmates in a siberian prison take part in an annual beauty contest which offers inmates a chance to demonstrate good behaviour and win early parole .
natalya khapova , 26 , wears a ball gown for the miss spring contest in the middle of a small room , with dirty-white walls decorated with pictures of jesus and an array of plastic plants , a young woman stands on a stool .
she wears a candy-pink , cotton ball gown .
at her feet , three other women sew tiny flowers along the hem of her giant hoop skirt .
her lips are painted bright red and light brown curls frame her face .
" a woman should always be beautiful , " says natalya khapova , 26 , as she poses on her pedestal .
" not just outside the fence .
even if she 's in here , she should show her beauty .
a woman is everything gentle and wonderful - or she should be . "
when the contest first began in 1990 , supplies were non-existent - the winner made her dress out of plastic bags from the prison kitchen the fence khapova refers to surrounds the correctional facility uf 91/9 , an all-women 's prison camp some 20 miles away from the siberian capital , novosibirsk .
her ball gown is one of three outfits she will don for the prison 's main event of the year - the annual " miss spring " beauty contest .
good behaviour we wanted to find ways to occupy convicts ' free time natalya baulina , prison 's administrative head the annual pageant is a welcome diversion from the strictly regimented routine and the monotony of life inside the jail .
but where " active participation in the social life of the camp " can help women win early parole , the " miss spring " contest has become an important way for the female inmates to demonstrate good behaviour .
" we wanted to find ways to occupy convicts ' free time , " says natalya baulina , the prison 's administrative head .
" when i first introduced the idea to the women , they were in utter shock .
the only pageant they knew was miss universe - women parading in barely visible swimsuits before male judges . "
the prison decided to invent its own rules with three categories - " greek goddesses " , " flower gowns " , and " imaginary uniforms " , which lets inmates design their ideal prison uniforms of the future .
many women have never heard of the greek myths or exotic flowers they portray onstage , but they learn from books provided by the staff .
participating in the pageant can help prisoners win early parole when the contest first began in 1990 , supplies were non-existent .
the winner made her dress out of plastic bags from the prison kitchen .
nowadays women have hairspray , lipstick , nail polish , and all manner of female accoutrements not normally allowed in the prison .
several guards and unit chiefs judge the contestants on their appearance and creativity , crowning the winner with a tiara " miss spring " and two runners-up " miss charm " and " miss grace " .
news crews even broadcast the event on local tv .
women turning to crime khapova , who has six-and-a-half years left of her eight-year sentence for assault , is one of more than 1,000 female inmates at uf 91/9 , who are serving time for everything from drug possession to murder .
when the soviet union disintegrated in 1991 , the economy collapsed almost overnight and many unemployed women turned to crime .
prisoners are subjected to a strict regime in siberia 's uf 91/9 there are now 35 women 's prisons in russia and the female incarceration rate is almost five times as high as britain 's .
half of the women at uf 91/9 are doing time for narcotics .
yulia lutsak , 30 , is serving four years for illegal drug trafficking .
she says a miscarriage , a cheating husband , and unemployment led her into drug use .
" i was on opium for three years , then heroin for a year , " she admits .
" i did n't have enough money , and someone asked me , ' why do n't you sell some ? '
that 's how i wound up here . "
yulia works as a supervisor and has a starring role in the pageant .
she is already planning her new life on the outside .
" i want to take computer courses , " she says , " and then maybe work at an orphanage . "
she says she never wants to come back to uf 91/9 , but she worries about the likelihood of finding work and the temptation to sink back into her old ways .
" maybe i lack self esteem , " she says .
" i think after the pageant i 'll feel more confident . "
the trouble with freedom natasha patalakhova has found life tough with a criminal record former inmate natasha patalakhova , 29 , who served eight years for armed assault , directed the pageant when she was in prison and her involvement helped her secure an early release .
but natasha has found life difficult on the outside .
as an ex-convict and a refugee from kazakhstan , she has been unable to get the papers she needs to work or even to travel .
" my prison days continue to haunt me , " she says .
but as she returns to the prison on contest day she is greeted like a superstar to hoots and cheers .
even after nona madjidova in a giant lily gown has been crowned miss spring , the real buzz is about natasha 's visit .
" i told them they could have a fresh beginning , " says natasha .
" i told them to forgive each other , help each other , and strive to get home .
what else could i say ? "

keith towler said the uk and assembly governments should explain now how they planned to end child poverty by 2020 .
the social justice minister admitted the rate of progress in wales had slowed down over the last two years .
but dr brian gibbons am said the issue continued to be tackled and " had to be a top priority " .
mr towler , who took over as children 's commissioner last week , told bbc wales : " i 'm beginning to think actually that the 2010 target is a bit of red herrring .
the absolute commitment was to end child poverty by 2020 .
" what we need the westminster government and the welsh assembly government -lsb- to do is -rsb- to come back to us now and say how are we going to achieve that by 2020 .
we ca n't fail children by 2020 . "
he made his comments after the publication of a new report , which said 90,000 children in wales were missing out on the likes of holidays and school trips .
' multiple disadvantages ' save the children wants more take-up of benefits and tax credit encouraged .
the charity , along with the bevan foundation think-tank , said wales ' poorest children are missing out on significant occasions rather than physical items .
it found 90,000 children - or 13 % - live in households which could be classed as in " severe poverty " .

several detained or former patients at rampton hospital in nottinghamshire argue the ban is a " disproportionate interference " with their rights .
nottinghamshire nhs healthcare trust said patients were given help to quit , adding the policy applied to the entire hospital organisation .
three individuals are seeking a judicial review at the high court .
basic freedoms they argue that article 8 of the european convention on human rights , which guarantees respect for private life , entrenches their right to smoke .
their lawyers argue that the hospital is their home - and to prevent them smoking there when they are not free to go elsewhere to smoke interferes with their rights .
smokers make up 26 % of the general population , but 70 % of mental health inpatients are smokers , according to mental health today .
marcus brown of cartwright king said it was a question of basic freedoms .
" you or i may not set so much store by being able to have a cigarette if we choose to or not .
but when it is a such part of your life it has a really devastating effect on them to be told that this is something they are no longer able to do .
" they are being deprived of the choice of doing what they want , " he said .
dr mike harris , director of the trust 's forensic services , said only three patients out of 370 patients were part of the case .
he said inmates were allowed to smoke in prison , but smoking was restricted by a smoke-free environment policy at rampton .
the hearing is expected to last four days .

several detained or former patients at rampton hospital in nottinghamshire argue the ban is a " disproportionate interference " with their rights .
nottinghamshire nhs healthcare trust said patients were given help to quit , adding the policy applied to the entire hospital organisation .
three individuals are seeking a judicial review at the high court .
basic freedoms they argue that article 8 of the european convention on human rights , which guarantees respect for private life , entrenches their right to smoke .
their lawyers argue that the hospital is their home - and to prevent them smoking there when they are not free to go elsewhere to smoke interferes with their rights .
smokers make up 26 % of the general population , but 70 % of mental health inpatients are smokers , according to mental health today .
marcus brown of cartwright king said it was a question of basic freedoms .
" you or i may not set so much store by being able to have a cigarette if we choose to or not .
but when it is a such part of your life it has a really devastating effect on them to be told that this is something they are no longer able to do .
" they are being deprived of the choice of doing what they want , " he said .
dr mike harris , director of the trust 's forensic services , said only three patients out of 370 patients were part of the case .
he said inmates were allowed to smoke in prison , but smoking was restricted by a smoke-free environment policy at rampton .
the hearing is expected to last four days .
