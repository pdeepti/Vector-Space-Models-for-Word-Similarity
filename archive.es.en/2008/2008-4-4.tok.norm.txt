but speculation in his native germany is mounting that he will return for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall in 2009 . during a private audience on thursday , april 3 , dieter althaus , the premier of german state thuringia , invited the pope to return to his home country .
though althaus ' spokesman said the pontiff was " basically open " to the idea , the head of the catholic church has yet to make an official decision . a tour of the former east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trip to erfurt would likely include mass at the cathedral of mary still , the mass-circulation tabloid bild reported friday that the journey would occur in mid-april 2009 .
the anticipated trip would combine celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the 60th anniversary of the passage of germany 's democratic constitution . it would also likely be limited to the cities of berlin and erfurt , thuringia 's capital .
in the heart of the communist former east germany , thuringia is the center of the cult of st. elizabeth of hungary -lrb- 1207-1231 -rrb- , who was born to a royal family and dedicated her life for the poor and sick . erfurt is also a place where catholics are few .
a visit there may be seen as a political move among germans , one-third of whom describe themselves as catholic .
althaus , however , said he would like the visit to focus on the role of the church in a globalized world and the position of the family in society . speculation about a fresh visit first peaked in february .
catholic church figures have asked benedict to visit , but the diocese of erfurt said thursday there was no official confirmation that the pope had accepted those invitations . a rare visit visits abroad by the 80-year-old pope are rare .
he has only three trips outside of italy scheduled for this year , including a much-publicized tour to the united states in mid-april .
during that trip , the former german cardinal joseph ratzinger will be touring a synagogue before the jewish high holiday of passover , a move intended to show good will to the jewish people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff was in cologne for world youth day in 2005 pope benedict xvi sparked controversy recently when he approved a revised version of a good friday mass in latin that includes a line asking god to help jews " acknowledge jesus christ as the savior . " a return to germany would mark the third visit for the pontiff since he ascended in 2005 .
his visit to cologne in 2005 as part of world youth day , a catholic youth convention , was received by a crowd of nearly 1 million - a record in the convention 's 20-year history . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

environmental protection groups supported the move . " we will not do it , " gabriel , a social democrat , told the television channel ard on friday , april 4 .
" it is not a measure dealing with environmental policy , but a measure destined to aid the automobile industry . " the news dealt a blow to so-called green fuels , which have been seen as a way to reduce global warming by reducing carbon dioxide emissions . mixing plant-based ethanol with fossil gasoline can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide , one of several so-called greenhouse gases that exacerbate climate change . but ecologists have complained about the practice not least because a number of countries destroy tropical rain forests in order to cultivate the plants used to make biofuels . damaging older cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers would pay the price , had the plans gone ahead germany had initially hailed biofuel blending as a way of achieving reductions in greenhouse gases without imposing restrictions proposed by the eu , which could hit the country 's performance car industry . the german e10 project was supposed to ensure that 10 percent of petrol used by cars and light trucks in germany was comprised of ethanol by 2009 . the initiative formed the cornerstone of berlin 's ambitious climate change policy package laid out in 2007 , designed to cut emissions 40 percent by 2020 at a cost of 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- . but politicians and industry groups had criticized the plans to raise the level to 10 percent for some gasoline grades from 5 percent , saying that the increase would damage older cars because the biofuels were more corrosive than conventional petrol and threatened to wear out certain engine parts too quickly . meanwhile , otmar bernhard , environment minister in bavaria from the conservative csu party , called the blending plans " climate policy hot air . " passing the buck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old cars would be hardest hit gabriel said he would abandon the project if the number of vehicles that could not use the fuel surpassed 1 million . on friday he said the number had exceeded 3 million and that these cars were not ready for the new fuel and could be forced to switch to more expensive , unblended gasoline grades because of possible damage .
most of the cars in question are imported . the environment minister said he feared the change could hit lower earners who generally own older cars . " our environmental policy does not want to be responsible for driving millions of car drivers ... to expensive super plus petrol pumps , " he told the mass-circulation bild tabloid . gabriel blamed the car industry for the switch in policy , saying it had revised its figures . the german automakers association vda had said thursday that the number was much lower , at around 360,000 , and that the jump in affected automobile was due to imported cars . " the german automotive industry has done its homework and stuck to its word , " vda president matthias wissmann said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tensions between the alliance and russia were eased somewhat , although differences of opinion still remain . it was nato 's biggest ever summit , held in an correspondingly huge venue - bucharest 's huge palace of the parliament .
and while issues like nato expansion and a us missile defense shield still divided the alliance and russia , moscow and the western pact are still on friendly terms and progress was made in several key areas . nato countries agreed to strengthen their defenses against cyber-attacks , launched a new television channel and smoothed over differences over the mission in afghanistan with a " vision statement . " russian president vladimir putin made his final appearance at a nato summit as president - he steps down next month - and nato leaders had praise for the positive mood after a 90-minute meeting on friday with the russian leader .
while no breakthroughs were forthcoming on disputes ranging from kosovo to a planned us missile shield in eastern europe , the meeting did warm relations that had become distinctly chilly . putin did criticize the western military pact for promising georgia and ukraine eventual membership , although nato did not go so far as to put former soviet states georgia and ukraine on a definite track for membership by granting them so-called membership action plans . positive spin still , both sides chose to put the accent on the positive . " the discussion was frank and open , there was no hiding of views but the spirit was positive , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters after the meeting . german chancellor angela merkel also played down any tension between russia and the defense alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin addresses the media on the third day of the nato summit " nato is not anti-anyone , especially not anti-russia , " she said after the meeting with putin .
she said russia was a partner , calling for a closer relationship and more frequent meetings between nato leaders and russia 's president . merkel emerged from the meeting with an even stronger reputation as a skilled diplomat .
according to the dpa news agency , several of her colleagues in bucharest noted her impressive negotiating prowess . frank words according to a source from the russian delegation who was at the friday meeting , putin lashed out at some nato countries for " demonizing " moscow and failing to reward russia for helping end the cold war . " some went as far as total demonization of russia and ca n't get away from this even now .
some began to talk about imperial ambitions , " putin told nato leaders at the summit , the source said , who asked not to be named . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush talks with germany 's angela merkel putin said that russia had peacefully withdrawn from eastern europe after the soviet collapse and " of course expected something in return .
but this did n't come . " putin also challenged american policy toward iran and said that the islamic republic , instead of being threatened , should be helped to emerge from isolation . " no one can seriously think that iran would dare attack the united states , " the source quoted putin as telling leaders .
" instead of pushing iran into a corner , it would be far more sensible to think together how to help iran become more predictable and transparent . " cyber defense in an attempt to meet new types of warfare , nato acknowledged the growing threat from cyber-attacks and committed themselves to " strengthening key alliance information systems " and to rush to one another 's defense in case of a assault conducted by computer . bildunterschrift : in april 2007 , estonia 's computer servers were hit by a massive , coordinated attack that almost crippled the baltic country 's banks and government services .
estonia 's firewalls successfully withstood the assault , which was blamed on russia hackers . over the new few months , nato allies and estonia are to set up a cyber defense center of excellence in tallinn .

while they failed to find a compromise , unscripted debates were already quite a novel thing , says dw 's bernd riegert . the big enlargement summit that nato 's leading power and many new eastern european members had wished for has fallen through .
germany and france thwarted us plans and candidates ukraine and georgia were sent back to the waiting room . the conflict between the us and western european countries was openly talked about at the summit .
that 's a new thing for nato , since usually decisions are already made beforehand and everything happens according to plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time , however , the outgoing american president was stymied in his almost missionary expansion zeal .
another unusual aspect of the meeting in bucharest was the fact that 25 nato countries were unable to get greece and macedonia to agree on a compromise in the bizarre twist over macedonia 's name .
that 's why only croatia and albania were invited to become members .
george w. bush , the lame duck , did n't manage to have his way against greece , either . the macedonian name controversy should be seen as an operational accident .
nothing has changed as far as nato 's fundamental readiness to welcome all balkan countries into the stabilizing community is concerned and that 's a good thing .
bosnia-herzegovina , montenegro and serbia were all given a clear perspective - what 's still unclear is how long it will take for all of them to sit at the table . the summit 's surprise was german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy 's newly revived close cooperation .
they obviously want to shift nato 's focus towards europe .
france 's return to nato 's military command structures in the coming year fits into that strategy .
it now depends on who will win the race to the white house and what level of importance the new administration will place on the alliance . an overly confident russian president vladimir putin has gained astonishing influence over nato during his last years of neo-nationalistic foreign policy .
the expansion to include ukraine and georgia was mainly delayed out of consideration for russian objections - something the denials by germany 's chancellor can not cover up . a framework agreement with the us also secured the kremlin a right to have a say in the matter of strategic missile defense , which naturally does n't present a threat to russia .
but accusations by the us and eastern europe that nato is throwing itself at putin are exaggerated . the nato-russia council offered a big stage to the outgoing president to reiterate his old and unfounded allegation at an emotional press conference .
this is probably meant for the domestic audience in russia - nato diplomats merely shake their heads in disbelief at putin 's behavior . despite all verbal attacks , russia and nato cooperate on a practical level , such as a common missile defense on the battle field or the transport of supplies to afghanistan .
for the first time , nato also discussed the orderly withdrawal from afghanistan , where it has been since 2001 . long overdue guidelines for when the multinational assistance force will hand over to afghans were finally decided on .
in the short term , nato will have to send even more troops to afghanistan to get the security situation under control . the germans will be called upon in the fall at the latest .
in bucharest , the chancellor cleverly managed to avert a debate on an expanded role for the german military in afghanistan , but it can not be avoided forever . bernd riegert covers nato as dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while they failed to find a compromise , unscripted debates were already quite a novel thing , says dw 's bernd riegert . the big enlargement summit that nato 's leading power and many new eastern european members had wished for has fallen through .
germany and france thwarted us plans and candidates ukraine and georgia were sent back to the waiting room . the conflict between the us and western european countries was openly talked about at the summit .
that 's a new thing for nato , since usually decisions are already made beforehand and everything happens according to plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time , however , the outgoing american president was stymied in his almost missionary expansion zeal .
another unusual aspect of the meeting in bucharest was the fact that 25 nato countries were unable to get greece and macedonia to agree on a compromise in the bizarre twist over macedonia 's name .
that 's why only croatia and albania were invited to become members .
george w. bush , the lame duck , did n't manage to have his way against greece , either . the macedonian name controversy should be seen as an operational accident .
nothing has changed as far as nato 's fundamental readiness to welcome all balkan countries into the stabilizing community is concerned and that 's a good thing .
bosnia-herzegovina , montenegro and serbia were all given a clear perspective - what 's still unclear is how long it will take for all of them to sit at the table . the summit 's surprise was german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy 's newly revived close cooperation .
they obviously want to shift nato 's focus towards europe .
france 's return to nato 's military command structures in the coming year fits into that strategy .
it now depends on who will win the race to the white house and what level of importance the new administration will place on the alliance . an overly confident russian president vladimir putin has gained astonishing influence over nato during his last years of neo-nationalistic foreign policy .
the expansion to include ukraine and georgia was mainly delayed out of consideration for russian objections - something the denials by germany 's chancellor can not cover up . a framework agreement with the us also secured the kremlin a right to have a say in the matter of strategic missile defense , which naturally does n't present a threat to russia .
but accusations by the us and eastern europe that nato is throwing itself at putin are exaggerated . the nato-russia council offered a big stage to the outgoing president to reiterate his old and unfounded allegation at an emotional press conference .
this is probably meant for the domestic audience in russia - nato diplomats merely shake their heads in disbelief at putin 's behavior . despite all verbal attacks , russia and nato cooperate on a practical level , such as a common missile defense on the battle field or the transport of supplies to afghanistan .
for the first time , nato also discussed the orderly withdrawal from afghanistan , where it has been since 2001 . long overdue guidelines for when the multinational assistance force will hand over to afghans were finally decided on .
in the short term , nato will have to send even more troops to afghanistan to get the security situation under control . the germans will be called upon in the fall at the latest .
in bucharest , the chancellor cleverly managed to avert a debate on an expanded role for the german military in afghanistan , but it can not be avoided forever . bernd riegert covers nato as dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de nato summit ends on positive note , fails to heal rifts a feared showdown friday between nato and russian president vladimir putin did not materialize , according to senior officials .

the move has stirred deep unease in some quarters . under the 10-year , 7.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- project , a consortium between the bundeswehr and private firms like siemens and ibm is upgrading non-military it and communications infrastructure .
the project involves some 140,000 pcs , 7,000 servers and 300,000 telephones .
the bundeswehr has used the private sector to a limited extent before - chiefly for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
project hercules , currently the largest initiative of its kind in europe , represents a giant leap in scale .
is germany going down the problematic path taken by the us of outsourcing massive sectors of the military to profit-conscious private enterprise ?
the consortium - called bwi information technologies - says no .
" using the private sector has advantages , " bwi chief executive officer peter blaschke said .
" the bundeswehr is dependent on annual parliamentary budgets and can only engage in short-term planning .
with project hercules , we can - for the first time - have a 10-year plan and be flexible with investments .
for example , we 've invested ahead in the first year to get the project off to a fast start .
in addition , we 're securing the know-how of experts over a number of years . "
but some german politicians are monitoring the initiative with an extremely critical eye .
" the privatization of bundeswehr tasks is the wrong way to go , " said paul schaefer , the defense spokesman for the opposition left party 's parliamentary group .
" the private sector can play a role , but the question is who is ultimately responsible for the decision-making , " schaefer added .
" ibm and siemens will want to recoup their money , and there no telling right now whether the project will actually yield savings .
the total price has already gone up from 6.6 to over 7 billion euros , and the whole thing was preceded by five years of costly negotiations . "
lessons from the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bwi 's peter blaschke says project hercules has built-in safeguards project hercules distinguished between " green " -lrb- military -rrb- and " white " -lrb- non-military -rrb- information technology , with bwi only responsible for the latter .
the bundeswehr itself is represented on the board of directors , and the consortium is open to audit by the military , the german defense ministry and the general accountants office .
that 's part of an attempt to avoid repeating mistakes made by the united states .
private military contractors employed by the pentagon have been accused in extreme cases - such as the 2004 torture scandal at the abu ghraib prison in iraq - being involved in human rights abuses .
there have also been allegations of companies over-charging , doing poor work and usurping whole military sectors .
" the bundeswehr has chosen a clever path , " blaschke said .
" this is not a normal business contract , but a mandate for the military to build up its own it company .
the main computer center will not end up at ibm , and the bundeswehr will not fall into the trap of not having the know-how to run its own equipment .
after 10 years , bwi will revert to 100 percent bundeswehr control - that 's specified by the contract . "
but contracts , some fear , can be broken .
" there 's definitely more supervisory administration in germany than in the us , " schaefer said .
" but the question of brain-drain remains .
will the know-how really return to or remain with the bundeswehr once the contract expires ? "
the challenge for the bundeswehr is how to utilize the flexibility and expertise of the private sector without making itself as dependent as the us army , which is sometimes unable to operate and maintain privately designed systems .
the line between green and white bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blackwater employees have been active in combat in iraq the us military is thoroughly entwined with military service providers , which include not just blackwater and halliburton but lesser-known companies like caci or dyncorp .
the industry is highly secretive , but some estimates put the number of private employees in iraq above that of all non-us foreign troops combined - essentially making business the second-largest force in that war-torn country .
especially in the fog of war , it can be difficult to distinguish clearly between military and non-military activities when it comes to private companies .
" in germany , we 're roughly where the us was in the late 1980s and early 1990s in that only civilian , non-military tasks are supposed to be outsourced , " schaefer said .
" but the vehicle maintenance company has already been in bosnia .
and it may probably be just a matter of time until logistics specialists become active in afghanistan as well . "
bwi acknowledges the difficulties of drawing absolute lines between civilian , domestic tasks and foreign , military ones .
but it says there are safeguards .
" bwi will not be active abroad with the bundeswehr , and we 're not involved in things like weapons-guidance systems or it for military command centers , " blaschke said .
" and in a crisis situation , where the lines get blurred , the bundeswehr can assume total responsibility for all areas .
that 's part of the agreement . "
bwi said project hercules has gotten off to an optimal start .
but it will be years down the road before its efficiency can be determined - and the question answered as to whether the bundeswehr has succeeded in maintaining the crucial distinction between civilian and military tasks . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has stirred deep unease in some quarters . under the 10-year , 7.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- project , a consortium between the bundeswehr and private firms like siemens and ibm is upgrading non-military it and communications infrastructure .
the project involves some 140,000 pcs , 7,000 servers and 300,000 telephones .
the bundeswehr has used the private sector to a limited extent before - chiefly for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
project hercules , currently the largest initiative of its kind in europe , represents a giant leap in scale .
is germany going down the problematic path taken by the us of outsourcing massive sectors of the military to profit-conscious private enterprise ?
the consortium - called bwi information technologies - says no .
" using the private sector has advantages , " bwi chief executive officer peter blaschke said .
" the bundeswehr is dependent on annual parliamentary budgets and can only engage in short-term planning .
with project hercules , we can - for the first time - have a 10-year plan and be flexible with investments .
for example , we 've invested ahead in the first year to get the project off to a fast start .
in addition , we 're securing the know-how of experts over a number of years . "
but some german politicians are monitoring the initiative with an extremely critical eye .
" the privatization of bundeswehr tasks is the wrong way to go , " said paul schaefer , the defense spokesman for the opposition left party 's parliamentary group .
" the private sector can play a role , but the question is who is ultimately responsible for the decision-making , " schaefer added .
" ibm and siemens will want to recoup their money , and there no telling right now whether the project will actually yield savings .
the total price has already gone up from 6.6 to over 7 billion euros , and the whole thing was preceded by five years of costly negotiations . "

the bundeswehr itself is represented on the board of directors , and the consortium is open to audit by the military , the german defense ministry and the general accountants office .
that 's part of an attempt to avoid repeating mistakes made by the united states .
private military contractors employed by the pentagon have been accused in extreme cases - such as the 2004 torture scandal at the abu ghraib prison in iraq - being involved in human rights abuses .
there have also been allegations of companies over-charging , doing poor work and usurping whole military sectors .
" the bundeswehr has chosen a clever path , " blaschke said .
" this is not a normal business contract , but a mandate for the military to build up its own it company .
the main computer center will not end up at ibm , and the bundeswehr will not fall into the trap of not having the know-how to run its own equipment .
after 10 years , bwi will revert to 100 percent bundeswehr control - that 's specified by the contract . "
but contracts , some fear , can be broken .
" there 's definitely more supervisory administration in germany than in the us , " schaefer said .
" but the question of brain-drain remains .
will the know-how really return to or remain with the bundeswehr once the contract expires ? "
the challenge for the bundeswehr is how to utilize the flexibility and expertise of the private sector without making itself as dependent as the us army , which is sometimes unable to operate and maintain privately designed systems .

especially in the fog of war , it can be difficult to distinguish clearly between military and non-military activities when it comes to private companies .
" in germany , we 're roughly where the us was in the late 1980s and early 1990s in that only civilian , non-military tasks are supposed to be outsourced , " schaefer said .

" in germany , we 're roughly where the us was in the late 1980s and early 1990s in that only civilian , non-military tasks are supposed to be outsourced , " schaefer said .
" but the vehicle maintenance company has already been in bosnia .
and it may probably be just a matter of time until logistics specialists become active in afghanistan as well . "
bwi acknowledges the difficulties of drawing absolute lines between civilian , domestic tasks and foreign , military ones .
but it says there are safeguards .
" bwi will not be active abroad with the bundeswehr , and we 're not involved in things like weapons-guidance systems or it for military command centers , " blaschke said .
" and in a crisis situation , where the lines get blurred , the bundeswehr can assume total responsibility for all areas .
that 's part of the agreement . "
bwi said project hercules has gotten off to an optimal start .
but it will be years down the road before its efficiency can be determined - and the question answered as to whether the bundeswehr has succeeded in maintaining the crucial distinction between civilian and military tasks . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 04.04.2008 opinion : lots of surprises at nato summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato leaders openly discussed their differences at the bucharest summit .
while they failed to find a compromise , unscripted debates were already quite a novel thing , says dw 's bernd riegert . the big enlargement summit that nato 's leading power and many new eastern european members had wished for has fallen through .
germany and france thwarted us plans and candidates ukraine and georgia were sent back to the waiting room . the conflict between the us and western european countries was openly talked about at the summit .
that 's a new thing for nato , since usually decisions are already made beforehand and everything happens according to plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time , however , the outgoing american president was stymied in his almost missionary expansion zeal .
another unusual aspect of the meeting in bucharest was the fact that 25 nato countries were unable to get greece and macedonia to agree on a compromise in the bizarre twist over macedonia 's name .
that 's why only croatia and albania were invited to become members .
george w. bush , the lame duck , did n't manage to have his way against greece , either . the macedonian name controversy should be seen as an operational accident .
nothing has changed as far as nato 's fundamental readiness to welcome all balkan countries into the stabilizing community is concerned and that 's a good thing .
bosnia-herzegovina , montenegro and serbia were all given a clear perspective - what 's still unclear is how long it will take for all of them to sit at the table . the summit 's surprise was german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy 's newly revived close cooperation .
they obviously want to shift nato 's focus towards europe .
france 's return to nato 's military command structures in the coming year fits into that strategy .
it now depends on who will win the race to the white house and what level of importance the new administration will place on the alliance . an overly confident russian president vladimir putin has gained astonishing influence over nato during his last years of neo-nationalistic foreign policy .
the expansion to include ukraine and georgia was mainly delayed out of consideration for russian objections - something the denials by germany 's chancellor can not cover up . a framework agreement with the us also secured the kremlin a right to have a say in the matter of strategic missile defense , which naturally does n't present a threat to russia .
but accusations by the us and eastern europe that nato is throwing itself at putin are exaggerated . the nato-russia council offered a big stage to the outgoing president to reiterate his old and unfounded allegation at an emotional press conference .
this is probably meant for the domestic audience in russia - nato diplomats merely shake their heads in disbelief at putin 's behavior . despite all verbal attacks , russia and nato cooperate on a practical level , such as a common missile defense on the battle field or the transport of supplies to afghanistan .
for the first time , nato also discussed the orderly withdrawal from afghanistan , where it has been since 2001 . long overdue guidelines for when the multinational assistance force will hand over to afghans were finally decided on .
in the short term , nato will have to send even more troops to afghanistan to get the security situation under control . the germans will be called upon in the fall at the latest .
in bucharest , the chancellor cleverly managed to avert a debate on an expanded role for the german military in afghanistan , but it can not be avoided forever . bernd riegert covers nato as dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is considered to be the current leader of europe and chancellor angela merkel the continent 's most influential politician , according to a six-nation poll published friday , april 4 .
only the us begs to differ . citizens in the five eu nations surveyed see germany as leader of the bloc , including 57 percent of spaniards and germans , 39 percent of italians and 35 percent of britons , according to the harris interactive poll published by france 24 television and the international herald tribune .
the poll of 6,478 people was conducted online between feb .
27 and march 6 . merkel came out well ahead of president nicolas " bling-bling " sarkozy as europe 's most influential personality - even in france where 38 percent cite the german leader against 18 percent their own president . although sarkozy is doing his best to seize the reins in europe , 68 percent of respondents in france still believe berlin is calling the shots in brussels - and germany is also seen as the country likely to have the most influence on the rest of europe over the next decade . trans-atlantic differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown -lrb- l -rrb- and bush - still close in the united states , meanwhile , perceptions are altogether different , with the much-touted " special relationship " between washington and london still very much in evidence . across the atlantic , a clear majority of 63 percent of americans believe britain to be the current leader of europe , a view shared by 33 percent of britons and 34 percent of italians . us respondents also believed british prime minister gordon brown to have most influence in europe at 23 percent , while sarkozy lags a long way behind with 9 percent and merkel with 8 percent . a potential ms. europe but back in europe , merkel ca n't be topped .
although most british and americans say they would choose former british prime minister tony blair as a potential president of europe , on the continent it is merkel who gets the popular vote , making her the only serving leader to be considered appropriate . the question has particular resonance with the prospect of an election for a newly empowered presidency of the european council looming on the horizon .
according to the lisbon treaty , eu leaders would , in future , choose a president for a 30-month term rather than the current six-month , rotating presidency system . earlier this week , even a high-ranking eu official suggested that merkel would be an ideal candidate to sit at the head of the eu table . " there are few women in the running when it comes to the eu 's top jobs , " said european communications commissioner margot wallstrom , pointing to merkel as a highly capable woman more than eligible for such a post . old europe gathering strength ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing ranks the six-nation poll was published the same week of the nato summit taking place in bucharest , which saw merkel and her sarkozy challenge us president george w. bush over the question of nato 's eastwards expansion , making it clear that berlin firmly opposed nato membership for georgia and ukraine in the short term . bush was forced to abandon his hopes for the two countries , while merkel , together with sarkozy , demonstrated that when germany and france close ranks they have considerable clout . on thursday , the french and german leaders , also announced that their nations would be jointly hosting the alliance 's 60th anniversary summit next year in the eastern french city of strasbourg and its german sister town of kehl , just across the rhine river . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but speculation in his native germany is mounting that he will return for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall in 2009 . during a private audience on thursday , april 3 , dieter althaus , the premier of german state thuringia , invited the pope to return to his home country .
though althaus ' spokesman said the pontiff was " basically open " to the idea , the head of the catholic church has yet to make an official decision . a tour of the former east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trip to erfurt would likely include mass at the cathedral of mary still , the mass-circulation tabloid bild reported friday that the journey would occur in mid-april 2009 .
the anticipated trip would combine celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the 60th anniversary of the passage of germany 's democratic constitution . it would also likely be limited to the cities of berlin and erfurt , thuringia 's capital .
in the heart of the communist former east germany , thuringia is the center of the cult of st. elizabeth of hungary -lrb- 1207-1231 -rrb- , who was born to a royal family and dedicated her life for the poor and sick . erfurt is also a place where catholics are few .
a visit there may be seen as a political move among germans , one-third of whom describe themselves as catholic .
althaus , however , said he would like the visit to focus on the role of the church in a globalized world and the position of the family in society . speculation about a fresh visit first peaked in february .
catholic church figures have asked benedict to visit , but the diocese of erfurt said thursday there was no official confirmation that the pope had accepted those invitations . a rare visit visits abroad by the 80-year-old pope are rare .
he has only three trips outside of italy scheduled for this year , including a much-publicized tour to the united states in mid-april .
during that trip , the former german cardinal joseph ratzinger will be touring a synagogue before the jewish high holiday of passover , a move intended to show good will to the jewish people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff was in cologne for world youth day in 2005 pope benedict xvi sparked controversy recently when he approved a revised version of a good friday mass in latin that includes a line asking god to help jews " acknowledge jesus christ as the savior . " a return to germany would mark the third visit for the pontiff since he ascended in 2005 .
his visit to cologne in 2005 as part of world youth day , a catholic youth convention , was received by a crowd of nearly 1 million - a record in the convention 's 20-year history . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but speculation in his native germany is mounting that he will return for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall in 2009 . during a private audience on thursday , april 3 , dieter althaus , the premier of german state thuringia , invited the pope to return to his home country .

catholic church figures have asked benedict to visit , but the diocese of erfurt said thursday there was no official confirmation that the pope had accepted those invitations . a rare visit visits abroad by the 80-year-old pope are rare .
he has only three trips outside of italy scheduled for this year , including a much-publicized tour to the united states in mid-april .

tensions between the alliance and russia were eased somewhat , although differences of opinion still remain . it was nato 's biggest ever summit , held in an correspondingly huge venue - bucharest 's huge palace of the parliament .
and while issues like nato expansion and a us missile defense shield still divided the alliance and russia , moscow and the western pact are still on friendly terms and progress was made in several key areas . nato countries agreed to strengthen their defenses against cyber-attacks , launched a new television channel and smoothed over differences over the mission in afghanistan with a " vision statement . " russian president vladimir putin made his final appearance at a nato summit as president - he steps down next month - and nato leaders had praise for the positive mood after a 90-minute meeting on friday with the russian leader .
while no breakthroughs were forthcoming on disputes ranging from kosovo to a planned us missile shield in eastern europe , the meeting did warm relations that had become distinctly chilly . putin did criticize the western military pact for promising georgia and ukraine eventual membership , although nato did not go so far as to put former soviet states georgia and ukraine on a definite track for membership by granting them so-called membership action plans . positive spin still , both sides chose to put the accent on the positive . " the discussion was frank and open , there was no hiding of views but the spirit was positive , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters after the meeting . german chancellor angela merkel also played down any tension between russia and the defense alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin addresses the media on the third day of the nato summit " nato is not anti-anyone , especially not anti-russia , " she said after the meeting with putin .
she said russia was a partner , calling for a closer relationship and more frequent meetings between nato leaders and russia 's president . merkel emerged from the meeting with an even stronger reputation as a skilled diplomat .
according to the dpa news agency , several of her colleagues in bucharest noted her impressive negotiating prowess . frank words according to a source from the russian delegation who was at the friday meeting , putin lashed out at some nato countries for " demonizing " moscow and failing to reward russia for helping end the cold war . " some went as far as total demonization of russia and ca n't get away from this even now .
some began to talk about imperial ambitions , " putin told nato leaders at the summit , the source said , who asked not to be named . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush talks with germany 's angela merkel putin said that russia had peacefully withdrawn from eastern europe after the soviet collapse and " of course expected something in return .
but this did n't come . " putin also challenged american policy toward iran and said that the islamic republic , instead of being threatened , should be helped to emerge from isolation . " no one can seriously think that iran would dare attack the united states , " the source quoted putin as telling leaders .
" instead of pushing iran into a corner , it would be far more sensible to think together how to help iran become more predictable and transparent . " cyber defense in an attempt to meet new types of warfare , nato acknowledged the growing threat from cyber-attacks and committed themselves to " strengthening key alliance information systems " and to rush to one another 's defense in case of a assault conducted by computer . bildunterschrift : in april 2007 , estonia 's computer servers were hit by a massive , coordinated attack that almost crippled the baltic country 's banks and government services .
estonia 's firewalls successfully withstood the assault , which was blamed on russia hackers . over the new few months , nato allies and estonia are to set up a cyber defense center of excellence in tallinn .
nato officials say that the alliance has a duty to protect sensitive targets such as financial and communication centers . " if one of our allies comes under attack , we need to be prepared , " one nato official told the dpa news agency . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of the imf , dominique strauss-kahn , on the other hand said that believes the real problem of the euro , as well as being overvalued , is the all powerful position of the european central bank . in monday 's edition of le monde , strauss-kahn said " the problem of the euro is that the european central bank , which has worked well to contain inflation , is all powerful . " " there is no counterweight in the shape of a real european finance minister who would be tasked with ensuring growth , " he told the newspaper . there have been persistent calls , especially in france , for the ecb to cut interest rates to bolster a slowing economy , but the bank has insisted that inflation remains the main threat and lending costs must remain high as a result . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 04.04.2008 opinion : lots of surprises at nato summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato leaders openly discussed their differences at the bucharest summit .
while they failed to find a compromise , unscripted debates were already quite a novel thing , says dw 's bernd riegert . the big enlargement summit that nato 's leading power and many new eastern european members had wished for has fallen through .
germany and france thwarted us plans and candidates ukraine and georgia were sent back to the waiting room . the conflict between the us and western european countries was openly talked about at the summit .
that 's a new thing for nato , since usually decisions are already made beforehand and everything happens according to plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time , however , the outgoing american president was stymied in his almost missionary expansion zeal .
another unusual aspect of the meeting in bucharest was the fact that 25 nato countries were unable to get greece and macedonia to agree on a compromise in the bizarre twist over macedonia 's name .
that 's why only croatia and albania were invited to become members .
george w. bush , the lame duck , did n't manage to have his way against greece , either . the macedonian name controversy should be seen as an operational accident .
nothing has changed as far as nato 's fundamental readiness to welcome all balkan countries into the stabilizing community is concerned and that 's a good thing .
bosnia-herzegovina , montenegro and serbia were all given a clear perspective - what 's still unclear is how long it will take for all of them to sit at the table . the summit 's surprise was german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy 's newly revived close cooperation .
they obviously want to shift nato 's focus towards europe .
france 's return to nato 's military command structures in the coming year fits into that strategy .
it now depends on who will win the race to the white house and what level of importance the new administration will place on the alliance . an overly confident russian president vladimir putin has gained astonishing influence over nato during his last years of neo-nationalistic foreign policy .
the expansion to include ukraine and georgia was mainly delayed out of consideration for russian objections - something the denials by germany 's chancellor can not cover up . a framework agreement with the us also secured the kremlin a right to have a say in the matter of strategic missile defense , which naturally does n't present a threat to russia .
but accusations by the us and eastern europe that nato is throwing itself at putin are exaggerated . the nato-russia council offered a big stage to the outgoing president to reiterate his old and unfounded allegation at an emotional press conference .
this is probably meant for the domestic audience in russia - nato diplomats merely shake their heads in disbelief at putin 's behavior . despite all verbal attacks , russia and nato cooperate on a practical level , such as a common missile defense on the battle field or the transport of supplies to afghanistan .
for the first time , nato also discussed the orderly withdrawal from afghanistan , where it has been since 2001 . long overdue guidelines for when the multinational assistance force will hand over to afghans were finally decided on .
in the short term , nato will have to send even more troops to afghanistan to get the security situation under control . the germans will be called upon in the fall at the latest .
in bucharest , the chancellor cleverly managed to avert a debate on an expanded role for the german military in afghanistan , but it can not be avoided forever . bernd riegert covers nato as dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de nato summit ends on positive note , fails to heal rifts a feared showdown friday between nato and russian president vladimir putin did not materialize , according to senior officials .
however , putin did warn nato members not to beef up european security at russia 's expense .
-lrb- 04.04.2008 -rrb- nato vows to bolster troops in afghanistan nato allies meeting in romania at a major alliance summit reconfirmed their " long-term commitment " to afghanistan and pledged to substantially beef up troop numbers in the country .
-lrb- 03.04.2008 -rrb- nato 's eastward expansion rift to dominate summit the membership bids of two former soviet republics , georgia and ukraine , backed strongly by us president bush , are set to overshadow a nato summit in romania - much to the displeasure of germany .

but speculation in his native germany is mounting that he will return for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall in 2009 . during a private audience on thursday , april 3 , dieter althaus , the premier of german state thuringia , invited the pope to return to his home country .
though althaus ' spokesman said the pontiff was " basically open " to the idea , the head of the catholic church has yet to make an official decision . a tour of the former east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trip to erfurt would likely include mass at the cathedral of mary still , the mass-circulation tabloid bild reported friday that the journey would occur in mid-april 2009 .
the anticipated trip would combine celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the 60th anniversary of the passage of germany 's democratic constitution . it would also likely be limited to the cities of berlin and erfurt , thuringia 's capital .
in the heart of the communist former east germany , thuringia is the center of the cult of st. elizabeth of hungary -lrb- 1207-1231 -rrb- , who was born to a royal family and dedicated her life for the poor and sick . erfurt is also a place where catholics are few .
a visit there may be seen as a political move among germans , one-third of whom describe themselves as catholic .
althaus , however , said he would like the visit to focus on the role of the church in a globalized world and the position of the family in society . speculation about a fresh visit first peaked in february .
catholic church figures have asked benedict to visit , but the diocese of erfurt said thursday there was no official confirmation that the pope had accepted those invitations . a rare visit visits abroad by the 80-year-old pope are rare .
he has only three trips outside of italy scheduled for this year , including a much-publicized tour to the united states in mid-april .
during that trip , the former german cardinal joseph ratzinger will be touring a synagogue before the jewish high holiday of passover , a move intended to show good will to the jewish people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff was in cologne for world youth day in 2005 pope benedict xvi sparked controversy recently when he approved a revised version of a good friday mass in latin that includes a line asking god to help jews " acknowledge jesus christ as the savior . " a return to germany would mark the third visit for the pontiff since he ascended in 2005 .

but speculation in his native germany is mounting that he will return for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall in 2009 . during a private audience on thursday , april 3 , dieter althaus , the premier of german state thuringia , invited the pope to return to his home country .
though althaus ' spokesman said the pontiff was " basically open " to the idea , the head of the catholic church has yet to make an official decision . a tour of the former east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trip to erfurt would likely include mass at the cathedral of mary still , the mass-circulation tabloid bild reported friday that the journey would occur in mid-april 2009 .
the anticipated trip would combine celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the 60th anniversary of the passage of germany 's democratic constitution . it would also likely be limited to the cities of berlin and erfurt , thuringia 's capital .
in the heart of the communist former east germany , thuringia is the center of the cult of st. elizabeth of hungary -lrb- 1207-1231 -rrb- , who was born to a royal family and dedicated her life for the poor and sick . erfurt is also a place where catholics are few .
a visit there may be seen as a political move among germans , one-third of whom describe themselves as catholic .
althaus , however , said he would like the visit to focus on the role of the church in a globalized world and the position of the family in society . speculation about a fresh visit first peaked in february .
catholic church figures have asked benedict to visit , but the diocese of erfurt said thursday there was no official confirmation that the pope had accepted those invitations . a rare visit visits abroad by the 80-year-old pope are rare .
he has only three trips outside of italy scheduled for this year , including a much-publicized tour to the united states in mid-april .
during that trip , the former german cardinal joseph ratzinger will be touring a synagogue before the jewish high holiday of passover , a move intended to show good will to the jewish people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff was in cologne for world youth day in 2005 pope benedict xvi sparked controversy recently when he approved a revised version of a good friday mass in latin that includes a line asking god to help jews " acknowledge jesus christ as the savior . " a return to germany would mark the third visit for the pontiff since he ascended in 2005 .

while they failed to find a compromise , unscripted debates were already quite a novel thing , says dw 's bernd riegert . the big enlargement summit that nato 's leading power and many new eastern european members had wished for has fallen through .
germany and france thwarted us plans and candidates ukraine and georgia were sent back to the waiting room . the conflict between the us and western european countries was openly talked about at the summit .
that 's a new thing for nato , since usually decisions are already made beforehand and everything happens according to plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time , however , the outgoing american president was stymied in his almost missionary expansion zeal .
another unusual aspect of the meeting in bucharest was the fact that 25 nato countries were unable to get greece and macedonia to agree on a compromise in the bizarre twist over macedonia 's name .
that 's why only croatia and albania were invited to become members .
george w. bush , the lame duck , did n't manage to have his way against greece , either . the macedonian name controversy should be seen as an operational accident .
nothing has changed as far as nato 's fundamental readiness to welcome all balkan countries into the stabilizing community is concerned and that 's a good thing .
bosnia-herzegovina , montenegro and serbia were all given a clear perspective - what 's still unclear is how long it will take for all of them to sit at the table . the summit 's surprise was german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy 's newly revived close cooperation .
they obviously want to shift nato 's focus towards europe .
france 's return to nato 's military command structures in the coming year fits into that strategy .
it now depends on who will win the race to the white house and what level of importance the new administration will place on the alliance . an overly confident russian president vladimir putin has gained astonishing influence over nato during his last years of neo-nationalistic foreign policy .
the expansion to include ukraine and georgia was mainly delayed out of consideration for russian objections - something the denials by germany 's chancellor can not cover up . a framework agreement with the us also secured the kremlin a right to have a say in the matter of strategic missile defense , which naturally does n't present a threat to russia .
but accusations by the us and eastern europe that nato is throwing itself at putin are exaggerated . the nato-russia council offered a big stage to the outgoing president to reiterate his old and unfounded allegation at an emotional press conference .
this is probably meant for the domestic audience in russia - nato diplomats merely shake their heads in disbelief at putin 's behavior . despite all verbal attacks , russia and nato cooperate on a practical level , such as a common missile defense on the battle field or the transport of supplies to afghanistan .
for the first time , nato also discussed the orderly withdrawal from afghanistan , where it has been since 2001 . long overdue guidelines for when the multinational assistance force will hand over to afghans were finally decided on .
in the short term , nato will have to send even more troops to afghanistan to get the security situation under control . the germans will be called upon in the fall at the latest .

while they failed to find a compromise , unscripted debates were already quite a novel thing , says dw 's bernd riegert . the big enlargement summit that nato 's leading power and many new eastern european members had wished for has fallen through .
germany and france thwarted us plans and candidates ukraine and georgia were sent back to the waiting room . the conflict between the us and western european countries was openly talked about at the summit .
that 's a new thing for nato , since usually decisions are already made beforehand and everything happens according to plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time , however , the outgoing american president was stymied in his almost missionary expansion zeal .
another unusual aspect of the meeting in bucharest was the fact that 25 nato countries were unable to get greece and macedonia to agree on a compromise in the bizarre twist over macedonia 's name .
that 's why only croatia and albania were invited to become members .
george w. bush , the lame duck , did n't manage to have his way against greece , either . the macedonian name controversy should be seen as an operational accident .
nothing has changed as far as nato 's fundamental readiness to welcome all balkan countries into the stabilizing community is concerned and that 's a good thing .
bosnia-herzegovina , montenegro and serbia were all given a clear perspective - what 's still unclear is how long it will take for all of them to sit at the table . the summit 's surprise was german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy 's newly revived close cooperation .
they obviously want to shift nato 's focus towards europe .
france 's return to nato 's military command structures in the coming year fits into that strategy .
it now depends on who will win the race to the white house and what level of importance the new administration will place on the alliance . an overly confident russian president vladimir putin has gained astonishing influence over nato during his last years of neo-nationalistic foreign policy .
the expansion to include ukraine and georgia was mainly delayed out of consideration for russian objections - something the denials by germany 's chancellor can not cover up . a framework agreement with the us also secured the kremlin a right to have a say in the matter of strategic missile defense , which naturally does n't present a threat to russia .
but accusations by the us and eastern europe that nato is throwing itself at putin are exaggerated . the nato-russia council offered a big stage to the outgoing president to reiterate his old and unfounded allegation at an emotional press conference .
this is probably meant for the domestic audience in russia - nato diplomats merely shake their heads in disbelief at putin 's behavior . despite all verbal attacks , russia and nato cooperate on a practical level , such as a common missile defense on the battle field or the transport of supplies to afghanistan .
for the first time , nato also discussed the orderly withdrawal from afghanistan , where it has been since 2001 . long overdue guidelines for when the multinational assistance force will hand over to afghans were finally decided on .
in the short term , nato will have to send even more troops to afghanistan to get the security situation under control . the germans will be called upon in the fall at the latest .
in bucharest , the chancellor cleverly managed to avert a debate on an expanded role for the german military in afghanistan , but it can not be avoided forever . bernd riegert covers nato as dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their failure to get permission for the side job is the least of their concerns at the moment . german officials have kept quiet in the past when retired special forces members have gone abroad to earn some extra income by passing on their expertise . but the current case , involving at least eight police officers and one german soldier , did lead them to start an investigation . according to a news report in german daily sueddeutsche zeitung , the accused went to libya in 2006 for a private security firm founded by a former member of the special forces unit gsg-9 of germany 's federal police .

germany is considered to be the current leader of europe and chancellor angela merkel the continent 's most influential politician , according to a six-nation poll published friday , april 4 .
only the us begs to differ . citizens in the five eu nations surveyed see germany as leader of the bloc , including 57 percent of spaniards and germans , 39 percent of italians and 35 percent of britons , according to the harris interactive poll published by france 24 television and the international herald tribune .
the poll of 6,478 people was conducted online between feb .
27 and march 6 . merkel came out well ahead of president nicolas " bling-bling " sarkozy as europe 's most influential personality - even in france where 38 percent cite the german leader against 18 percent their own president . although sarkozy is doing his best to seize the reins in europe , 68 percent of respondents in france still believe berlin is calling the shots in brussels - and germany is also seen as the country likely to have the most influence on the rest of europe over the next decade . trans-atlantic differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown -lrb- l -rrb- and bush - still close in the united states , meanwhile , perceptions are altogether different , with the much-touted " special relationship " between washington and london still very much in evidence . across the atlantic , a clear majority of 63 percent of americans believe britain to be the current leader of europe , a view shared by 33 percent of britons and 34 percent of italians . us respondents also believed british prime minister gordon brown to have most influence in europe at 23 percent , while sarkozy lags a long way behind with 9 percent and merkel with 8 percent . a potential ms. europe but back in europe , merkel ca n't be topped .
although most british and americans say they would choose former british prime minister tony blair as a potential president of europe , on the continent it is merkel who gets the popular vote , making her the only serving leader to be considered appropriate . the question has particular resonance with the prospect of an election for a newly empowered presidency of the european council looming on the horizon .
according to the lisbon treaty , eu leaders would , in future , choose a president for a 30-month term rather than the current six-month , rotating presidency system . earlier this week , even a high-ranking eu official suggested that merkel would be an ideal candidate to sit at the head of the eu table . " there are few women in the running when it comes to the eu 's top jobs , " said european communications commissioner margot wallstrom , pointing to merkel as a highly capable woman more than eligible for such a post . old europe gathering strength ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing ranks the six-nation poll was published the same week of the nato summit taking place in bucharest , which saw merkel and her sarkozy challenge us president george w. bush over the question of nato 's eastwards expansion , making it clear that berlin firmly opposed nato membership for georgia and ukraine in the short term . bush was forced to abandon his hopes for the two countries , while merkel , together with sarkozy , demonstrated that when germany and france close ranks they have considerable clout . on thursday , the french and german leaders , also announced that their nations would be jointly hosting the alliance 's 60th anniversary summit next year in the eastern french city of strasbourg and its german sister town of kehl , just across the rhine river . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is considered to be the current leader of europe and chancellor angela merkel the continent 's most influential politician , according to a six-nation poll published friday , april 4 .
only the us begs to differ . citizens in the five eu nations surveyed see germany as leader of the bloc , including 57 percent of spaniards and germans , 39 percent of italians and 35 percent of britons , according to the harris interactive poll published by france 24 television and the international herald tribune .
the poll of 6,478 people was conducted online between feb .
27 and march 6 . merkel came out well ahead of president nicolas " bling-bling " sarkozy as europe 's most influential personality - even in france where 38 percent cite the german leader against 18 percent their own president . although sarkozy is doing his best to seize the reins in europe , 68 percent of respondents in france still believe berlin is calling the shots in brussels - and germany is also seen as the country likely to have the most influence on the rest of europe over the next decade . trans-atlantic differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown -lrb- l -rrb- and bush - still close in the united states , meanwhile , perceptions are altogether different , with the much-touted " special relationship " between washington and london still very much in evidence . across the atlantic , a clear majority of 63 percent of americans believe britain to be the current leader of europe , a view shared by 33 percent of britons and 34 percent of italians . us respondents also believed british prime minister gordon brown to have most influence in europe at 23 percent , while sarkozy lags a long way behind with 9 percent and merkel with 8 percent . a potential ms. europe but back in europe , merkel ca n't be topped .
although most british and americans say they would choose former british prime minister tony blair as a potential president of europe , on the continent it is merkel who gets the popular vote , making her the only serving leader to be considered appropriate . the question has particular resonance with the prospect of an election for a newly empowered presidency of the european council looming on the horizon .
according to the lisbon treaty , eu leaders would , in future , choose a president for a 30-month term rather than the current six-month , rotating presidency system . earlier this week , even a high-ranking eu official suggested that merkel would be an ideal candidate to sit at the head of the eu table . " there are few women in the running when it comes to the eu 's top jobs , " said european communications commissioner margot wallstrom , pointing to merkel as a highly capable woman more than eligible for such a post . old europe gathering strength ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing ranks the six-nation poll was published the same week of the nato summit taking place in bucharest , which saw merkel and her sarkozy challenge us president george w. bush over the question of nato 's eastwards expansion , making it clear that berlin firmly opposed nato membership for georgia and ukraine in the short term . bush was forced to abandon his hopes for the two countries , while merkel , together with sarkozy , demonstrated that when germany and france close ranks they have considerable clout . on thursday , the french and german leaders , also announced that their nations would be jointly hosting the alliance 's 60th anniversary summit next year in the eastern french city of strasbourg and its german sister town of kehl , just across the rhine river . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but speculation in his native germany is mounting that he will return for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall in 2009 . during a private audience on thursday , april 3 , dieter althaus , the premier of german state thuringia , invited the pope to return to his home country .
though althaus ' spokesman said the pontiff was " basically open " to the idea , the head of the catholic church has yet to make an official decision . a tour of the former east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trip to erfurt would likely include mass at the cathedral of mary still , the mass-circulation tabloid bild reported friday that the journey would occur in mid-april 2009 .
the anticipated trip would combine celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the 60th anniversary of the passage of germany 's democratic constitution . it would also likely be limited to the cities of berlin and erfurt , thuringia 's capital .
in the heart of the communist former east germany , thuringia is the center of the cult of st. elizabeth of hungary -lrb- 1207-1231 -rrb- , who was born to a royal family and dedicated her life for the poor and sick . erfurt is also a place where catholics are few .
a visit there may be seen as a political move among germans , one-third of whom describe themselves as catholic .
althaus , however , said he would like the visit to focus on the role of the church in a globalized world and the position of the family in society . speculation about a fresh visit first peaked in february .
catholic church figures have asked benedict to visit , but the diocese of erfurt said thursday there was no official confirmation that the pope had accepted those invitations . a rare visit visits abroad by the 80-year-old pope are rare .
he has only three trips outside of italy scheduled for this year , including a much-publicized tour to the united states in mid-april .
during that trip , the former german cardinal joseph ratzinger will be touring a synagogue before the jewish high holiday of passover , a move intended to show good will to the jewish people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff was in cologne for world youth day in 2005 pope benedict xvi sparked controversy recently when he approved a revised version of a good friday mass in latin that includes a line asking god to help jews " acknowledge jesus christ as the savior . " a return to germany would mark the third visit for the pontiff since he ascended in 2005 .
his visit to cologne in 2005 as part of world youth day , a catholic youth convention , was received by a crowd of nearly 1 million - a record in the convention 's 20-year history . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have signed a memorandum of understanding on financial stability and cooperation in order to ensure stability , " said slovenian finance minister andrej bajuk after chairing a meeting with eu finance ministers and central bankers in the city of brdo .
under the agreement , public bailouts would be sought only if an institution 's troubles threatened the broader economy and there there were no private sector solution , according to the agreement .
" the use of public money to resolve a crisis can never be taken for granted and will only be considered to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy , " the document says .
" the management of an ailing institution will be held accountable , shareholders will not be bailed out and creditors and uninsured depositors should expect to face losses , " it says .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet said that european central banks ' assistance to troubled institutions was limited to situations " where there is a liquidity problem and not a solvency problem . "
minister cautions against " hysteria " arriving in the town of brdo to meet with his colleagues on friday , april 4 , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said that there was no point in getting too worked up over the current problems . " it 's going to keep us busy throughout 2008 , but i advise against getting hysterical about it , " steinbrueck told reporters . along with a record-strong euro , the bloc is also faced with sky-high inflation , which rose to 3.5 percent in march , the highest level since the euro zone was formed in 1999 . while saying that the situation was likely to get even worse , luxembourg 's premier and finance minster jean-claude juncker also tried to look on the bright side .
he said that the international monetary fund 's decision to lower the euro zone 's growth forecast to 1.3 percent for 2008 was " too pessimistic . " but juncker , who also heads the group of euro zone finance ministers , said that he did expect the eu commission to also lower its forecast from the current level of 1.8 percent . structural problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans keep getting less for more euros slovenia 's finance minister , andrej bajuk , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , meanwhile said that there definitely was concern about the current inflation within the bloc . " the changes that we are now seeing seem every day more of a structural nature than just a question of short-term development , " he said . jean-claude trichet has said that employers , including governments , should keep wage hikes moderate to avoid further inflation , according to ap news service . is ecb the problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the ecb partially to blame ?
the head of the imf , dominique strauss-kahn , on the other hand said that believes the real problem of the euro , as well as being overvalued , is the all powerful position of the european central bank . in monday 's edition of le monde , strauss-kahn said " the problem of the euro is that the european central bank , which has worked well to contain inflation , is all powerful . " " there is no counterweight in the shape of a real european finance minister who would be tasked with ensuring growth , " he told the newspaper . there have been persistent calls , especially in france , for the ecb to cut interest rates to bolster a slowing economy , but the bank has insisted that inflation remains the main threat and lending costs must remain high as a result . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the management of an ailing institution will be held accountable , shareholders will not be bailed out and creditors and uninsured depositors should expect to face losses , " it says .

he said that the international monetary fund 's decision to lower the euro zone 's growth forecast to 1.3 percent for 2008 was " too pessimistic . " but juncker , who also heads the group of euro zone finance ministers , said that he did expect the eu commission to also lower its forecast from the current level of 1.8 percent . structural problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans keep getting less for more euros slovenia 's finance minister , andrej bajuk , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , meanwhile said that there definitely was concern about the current inflation within the bloc .

the head of the imf , dominique strauss-kahn , on the other hand said that believes the real problem of the euro , as well as being overvalued , is the all powerful position of the european central bank . in monday 's edition of le monde , strauss-kahn said " the problem of the euro is that the european central bank , which has worked well to contain inflation , is all powerful . " " there is no counterweight in the shape of a real european finance minister who would be tasked with ensuring growth , " he told the newspaper . there have been persistent calls , especially in france , for the ecb to cut interest rates to bolster a slowing economy , but the bank has insisted that inflation remains the main threat and lending costs must remain high as a result . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but speculation in his native germany is mounting that he will return for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall in 2009 . during a private audience on thursday , april 3 , dieter althaus , the premier of german state thuringia , invited the pope to return to his home country .
though althaus ' spokesman said the pontiff was " basically open " to the idea , the head of the catholic church has yet to make an official decision . a tour of the former east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trip to erfurt would likely include mass at the cathedral of mary still , the mass-circulation tabloid bild reported friday that the journey would occur in mid-april 2009 .
the anticipated trip would combine celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the 60th anniversary of the passage of germany 's democratic constitution . it would also likely be limited to the cities of berlin and erfurt , thuringia 's capital .
in the heart of the communist former east germany , thuringia is the center of the cult of st. elizabeth of hungary -lrb- 1207-1231 -rrb- , who was born to a royal family and dedicated her life for the poor and sick . erfurt is also a place where catholics are few .
a visit there may be seen as a political move among germans , one-third of whom describe themselves as catholic .
althaus , however , said he would like the visit to focus on the role of the church in a globalized world and the position of the family in society . speculation about a fresh visit first peaked in february .
catholic church figures have asked benedict to visit , but the diocese of erfurt said thursday there was no official confirmation that the pope had accepted those invitations . a rare visit visits abroad by the 80-year-old pope are rare .
he has only three trips outside of italy scheduled for this year , including a much-publicized tour to the united states in mid-april .
during that trip , the former german cardinal joseph ratzinger will be touring a synagogue before the jewish high holiday of passover , a move intended to show good will to the jewish people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff was in cologne for world youth day in 2005 pope benedict xvi sparked controversy recently when he approved a revised version of a good friday mass in latin that includes a line asking god to help jews " acknowledge jesus christ as the savior . " a return to germany would mark the third visit for the pontiff since he ascended in 2005 .
his visit to cologne in 2005 as part of world youth day , a catholic youth convention , was received by a crowd of nearly 1 million - a record in the convention 's 20-year history . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

environmental protection groups supported the move . " we will not do it , " gabriel , a social democrat , told the television channel ard on friday , april 4 .
" it is not a measure dealing with environmental policy , but a measure destined to aid the automobile industry . " the news dealt a blow to so-called green fuels , which have been seen as a way to reduce global warming by reducing carbon dioxide emissions . mixing plant-based ethanol with fossil gasoline can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide , one of several so-called greenhouse gases that exacerbate climate change . but ecologists have complained about the practice not least because a number of countries destroy tropical rain forests in order to cultivate the plants used to make biofuels . damaging older cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers would pay the price , had the plans gone ahead germany had initially hailed biofuel blending as a way of achieving reductions in greenhouse gases without imposing restrictions proposed by the eu , which could hit the country 's performance car industry . the german e10 project was supposed to ensure that 10 percent of petrol used by cars and light trucks in germany was comprised of ethanol by 2009 . the initiative formed the cornerstone of berlin 's ambitious climate change policy package laid out in 2007 , designed to cut emissions 40 percent by 2020 at a cost of 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- . but politicians and industry groups had criticized the plans to raise the level to 10 percent for some gasoline grades from 5 percent , saying that the increase would damage older cars because the biofuels were more corrosive than conventional petrol and threatened to wear out certain engine parts too quickly . meanwhile , otmar bernhard , environment minister in bavaria from the conservative csu party , called the blending plans " climate policy hot air . " passing the buck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old cars would be hardest hit gabriel said he would abandon the project if the number of vehicles that could not use the fuel surpassed 1 million . on friday he said the number had exceeded 3 million and that these cars were not ready for the new fuel and could be forced to switch to more expensive , unblended gasoline grades because of possible damage .
most of the cars in question are imported . the environment minister said he feared the change could hit lower earners who generally own older cars . " our environmental policy does not want to be responsible for driving millions of car drivers ... to expensive super plus petrol pumps , " he told the mass-circulation bild tabloid . gabriel blamed the car industry for the switch in policy , saying it had revised its figures . the german automakers association vda had said thursday that the number was much lower , at around 360,000 , and that the jump in affected automobile was due to imported cars . " the german automotive industry has done its homework and stuck to its word , " vda president matthias wissmann said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tensions between the alliance and russia were eased somewhat , although differences of opinion still remain . it was nato 's biggest ever summit , held in an correspondingly huge venue - bucharest 's huge palace of the parliament .
and while issues like nato expansion and a us missile defense shield still divided the alliance and russia , moscow and the western pact are still on friendly terms and progress was made in several key areas . nato countries agreed to strengthen their defenses against cyber-attacks , launched a new television channel and smoothed over differences over the mission in afghanistan with a " vision statement . " russian president vladimir putin made his final appearance at a nato summit as president - he steps down next month - and nato leaders had praise for the positive mood after a 90-minute meeting on friday with the russian leader .
while no breakthroughs were forthcoming on disputes ranging from kosovo to a planned us missile shield in eastern europe , the meeting did warm relations that had become distinctly chilly . putin did criticize the western military pact for promising georgia and ukraine eventual membership , although nato did not go so far as to put former soviet states georgia and ukraine on a definite track for membership by granting them so-called membership action plans . positive spin still , both sides chose to put the accent on the positive . " the discussion was frank and open , there was no hiding of views but the spirit was positive , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters after the meeting . german chancellor angela merkel also played down any tension between russia and the defense alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin addresses the media on the third day of the nato summit " nato is not anti-anyone , especially not anti-russia , " she said after the meeting with putin .
she said russia was a partner , calling for a closer relationship and more frequent meetings between nato leaders and russia 's president . merkel emerged from the meeting with an even stronger reputation as a skilled diplomat .
according to the dpa news agency , several of her colleagues in bucharest noted her impressive negotiating prowess . frank words according to a source from the russian delegation who was at the friday meeting , putin lashed out at some nato countries for " demonizing " moscow and failing to reward russia for helping end the cold war . " some went as far as total demonization of russia and ca n't get away from this even now .
some began to talk about imperial ambitions , " putin told nato leaders at the summit , the source said , who asked not to be named . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush talks with germany 's angela merkel putin said that russia had peacefully withdrawn from eastern europe after the soviet collapse and " of course expected something in return .
but this did n't come . " putin also challenged american policy toward iran and said that the islamic republic , instead of being threatened , should be helped to emerge from isolation . " no one can seriously think that iran would dare attack the united states , " the source quoted putin as telling leaders .
" instead of pushing iran into a corner , it would be far more sensible to think together how to help iran become more predictable and transparent . " cyber defense in an attempt to meet new types of warfare , nato acknowledged the growing threat from cyber-attacks and committed themselves to " strengthening key alliance information systems " and to rush to one another 's defense in case of a assault conducted by computer . bildunterschrift : in april 2007 , estonia 's computer servers were hit by a massive , coordinated attack that almost crippled the baltic country 's banks and government services .
estonia 's firewalls successfully withstood the assault , which was blamed on russia hackers . over the new few months , nato allies and estonia are to set up a cyber defense center of excellence in tallinn .
nato officials say that the alliance has a duty to protect sensitive targets such as financial and communication centers . " if one of our allies comes under attack , we need to be prepared , " one nato official told the dpa news agency . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 04.04.2008 german army 's it project raises military privatization issues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project is supposed to free soldiers for their core tasks this year , the german army kickstarts project hercules , a billion-euro initiative transferring non-military computer services to a public-private partnership .
the move has stirred deep unease in some quarters . under the 10-year , 7.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- project , a consortium between the bundeswehr and private firms like siemens and ibm is upgrading non-military it and communications infrastructure .
the project involves some 140,000 pcs , 7,000 servers and 300,000 telephones .
the bundeswehr has used the private sector to a limited extent before - chiefly for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
project hercules , currently the largest initiative of its kind in europe , represents a giant leap in scale .
is germany going down the problematic path taken by the us of outsourcing massive sectors of the military to profit-conscious private enterprise ?
the consortium - called bwi information technologies - says no .
" using the private sector has advantages , " bwi chief executive officer peter blaschke said .
" the bundeswehr is dependent on annual parliamentary budgets and can only engage in short-term planning .
with project hercules , we can - for the first time - have a 10-year plan and be flexible with investments .
for example , we 've invested ahead in the first year to get the project off to a fast start .
in addition , we 're securing the know-how of experts over a number of years . "
but some german politicians are monitoring the initiative with an extremely critical eye .
" the privatization of bundeswehr tasks is the wrong way to go , " said paul schaefer , the defense spokesman for the opposition left party 's parliamentary group .
" the private sector can play a role , but the question is who is ultimately responsible for the decision-making , " schaefer added .
" ibm and siemens will want to recoup their money , and there no telling right now whether the project will actually yield savings .
the total price has already gone up from 6.6 to over 7 billion euros , and the whole thing was preceded by five years of costly negotiations . "
lessons from the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bwi 's peter blaschke says project hercules has built-in safeguards project hercules distinguished between " green " -lrb- military -rrb- and " white " -lrb- non-military -rrb- information technology , with bwi only responsible for the latter .
the bundeswehr itself is represented on the board of directors , and the consortium is open to audit by the military , the german defense ministry and the general accountants office .
that 's part of an attempt to avoid repeating mistakes made by the united states .
private military contractors employed by the pentagon have been accused in extreme cases - such as the 2004 torture scandal at the abu ghraib prison in iraq - being involved in human rights abuses .
there have also been allegations of companies over-charging , doing poor work and usurping whole military sectors .
" the bundeswehr has chosen a clever path , " blaschke said .
" this is not a normal business contract , but a mandate for the military to build up its own it company .
the main computer center will not end up at ibm , and the bundeswehr will not fall into the trap of not having the know-how to run its own equipment .
after 10 years , bwi will revert to 100 percent bundeswehr control - that 's specified by the contract . "
but contracts , some fear , can be broken .
" there 's definitely more supervisory administration in germany than in the us , " schaefer said .
" but the question of brain-drain remains .
will the know-how really return to or remain with the bundeswehr once the contract expires ? "
the challenge for the bundeswehr is how to utilize the flexibility and expertise of the private sector without making itself as dependent as the us army , which is sometimes unable to operate and maintain privately designed systems .
the line between green and white bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blackwater employees have been active in combat in iraq the us military is thoroughly entwined with military service providers , which include not just blackwater and halliburton but lesser-known companies like caci or dyncorp .
the industry is highly secretive , but some estimates put the number of private employees in iraq above that of all non-us foreign troops combined - essentially making business the second-largest force in that war-torn country .
especially in the fog of war , it can be difficult to distinguish clearly between military and non-military activities when it comes to private companies .
" in germany , we 're roughly where the us was in the late 1980s and early 1990s in that only civilian , non-military tasks are supposed to be outsourced , " schaefer said .
" but the vehicle maintenance company has already been in bosnia .
and it may probably be just a matter of time until logistics specialists become active in afghanistan as well . "
bwi acknowledges the difficulties of drawing absolute lines between civilian , domestic tasks and foreign , military ones .
but it says there are safeguards .
" bwi will not be active abroad with the bundeswehr , and we 're not involved in things like weapons-guidance systems or it for military command centers , " blaschke said .
" and in a crisis situation , where the lines get blurred , the bundeswehr can assume total responsibility for all areas .
that 's part of the agreement . "
bwi said project hercules has gotten off to an optimal start .
but it will be years down the road before its efficiency can be determined - and the question answered as to whether the bundeswehr has succeeded in maintaining the crucial distinction between civilian and military tasks . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has stirred deep unease in some quarters . under the 10-year , 7.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- project , a consortium between the bundeswehr and private firms like siemens and ibm is upgrading non-military it and communications infrastructure .
the project involves some 140,000 pcs , 7,000 servers and 300,000 telephones .
the bundeswehr has used the private sector to a limited extent before - chiefly for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
project hercules , currently the largest initiative of its kind in europe , represents a giant leap in scale .
is germany going down the problematic path taken by the us of outsourcing massive sectors of the military to profit-conscious private enterprise ?
the consortium - called bwi information technologies - says no .
" using the private sector has advantages , " bwi chief executive officer peter blaschke said .
" the bundeswehr is dependent on annual parliamentary budgets and can only engage in short-term planning .
with project hercules , we can - for the first time - have a 10-year plan and be flexible with investments .
for example , we 've invested ahead in the first year to get the project off to a fast start .
in addition , we 're securing the know-how of experts over a number of years . "
but some german politicians are monitoring the initiative with an extremely critical eye .
" the privatization of bundeswehr tasks is the wrong way to go , " said paul schaefer , the defense spokesman for the opposition left party 's parliamentary group .
" the private sector can play a role , but the question is who is ultimately responsible for the decision-making , " schaefer added .
" ibm and siemens will want to recoup their money , and there no telling right now whether the project will actually yield savings .
the total price has already gone up from 6.6 to over 7 billion euros , and the whole thing was preceded by five years of costly negotiations . "
lessons from the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bwi 's peter blaschke says project hercules has built-in safeguards project hercules distinguished between " green " -lrb- military -rrb- and " white " -lrb- non-military -rrb- information technology , with bwi only responsible for the latter .
the bundeswehr itself is represented on the board of directors , and the consortium is open to audit by the military , the german defense ministry and the general accountants office .
that 's part of an attempt to avoid repeating mistakes made by the united states .
private military contractors employed by the pentagon have been accused in extreme cases - such as the 2004 torture scandal at the abu ghraib prison in iraq - being involved in human rights abuses .
there have also been allegations of companies over-charging , doing poor work and usurping whole military sectors .
" the bundeswehr has chosen a clever path , " blaschke said .
" this is not a normal business contract , but a mandate for the military to build up its own it company .
the main computer center will not end up at ibm , and the bundeswehr will not fall into the trap of not having the know-how to run its own equipment .
after 10 years , bwi will revert to 100 percent bundeswehr control - that 's specified by the contract . "
but contracts , some fear , can be broken .
" there 's definitely more supervisory administration in germany than in the us , " schaefer said .
" but the question of brain-drain remains .
will the know-how really return to or remain with the bundeswehr once the contract expires ? "
the challenge for the bundeswehr is how to utilize the flexibility and expertise of the private sector without making itself as dependent as the us army , which is sometimes unable to operate and maintain privately designed systems .

the industry is highly secretive , but some estimates put the number of private employees in iraq above that of all non-us foreign troops combined - essentially making business the second-largest force in that war-torn country .
especially in the fog of war , it can be difficult to distinguish clearly between military and non-military activities when it comes to private companies .
" in germany , we 're roughly where the us was in the late 1980s and early 1990s in that only civilian , non-military tasks are supposed to be outsourced , " schaefer said .
" but the vehicle maintenance company has already been in bosnia .

that 's part of the agreement . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 04.04.2008 opinion : lots of surprises at nato summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato leaders openly discussed their differences at the bucharest summit .
while they failed to find a compromise , unscripted debates were already quite a novel thing , says dw 's bernd riegert . the big enlargement summit that nato 's leading power and many new eastern european members had wished for has fallen through .
germany and france thwarted us plans and candidates ukraine and georgia were sent back to the waiting room . the conflict between the us and western european countries was openly talked about at the summit .
that 's a new thing for nato , since usually decisions are already made beforehand and everything happens according to plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time , however , the outgoing american president was stymied in his almost missionary expansion zeal .
another unusual aspect of the meeting in bucharest was the fact that 25 nato countries were unable to get greece and macedonia to agree on a compromise in the bizarre twist over macedonia 's name .
that 's why only croatia and albania were invited to become members .
george w. bush , the lame duck , did n't manage to have his way against greece , either . the macedonian name controversy should be seen as an operational accident .
nothing has changed as far as nato 's fundamental readiness to welcome all balkan countries into the stabilizing community is concerned and that 's a good thing .
bosnia-herzegovina , montenegro and serbia were all given a clear perspective - what 's still unclear is how long it will take for all of them to sit at the table . the summit 's surprise was german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy 's newly revived close cooperation .
they obviously want to shift nato 's focus towards europe .
france 's return to nato 's military command structures in the coming year fits into that strategy .
it now depends on who will win the race to the white house and what level of importance the new administration will place on the alliance . an overly confident russian president vladimir putin has gained astonishing influence over nato during his last years of neo-nationalistic foreign policy .
the expansion to include ukraine and georgia was mainly delayed out of consideration for russian objections - something the denials by germany 's chancellor can not cover up . a framework agreement with the us also secured the kremlin a right to have a say in the matter of strategic missile defense , which naturally does n't present a threat to russia .
but accusations by the us and eastern europe that nato is throwing itself at putin are exaggerated . the nato-russia council offered a big stage to the outgoing president to reiterate his old and unfounded allegation at an emotional press conference .
this is probably meant for the domestic audience in russia - nato diplomats merely shake their heads in disbelief at putin 's behavior . despite all verbal attacks , russia and nato cooperate on a practical level , such as a common missile defense on the battle field or the transport of supplies to afghanistan .
for the first time , nato also discussed the orderly withdrawal from afghanistan , where it has been since 2001 . long overdue guidelines for when the multinational assistance force will hand over to afghans were finally decided on .
in the short term , nato will have to send even more troops to afghanistan to get the security situation under control . the germans will be called upon in the fall at the latest .
in bucharest , the chancellor cleverly managed to avert a debate on an expanded role for the german military in afghanistan , but it can not be avoided forever . bernd riegert covers nato as dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de nato summit ends on positive note , fails to heal rifts a feared showdown friday between nato and russian president vladimir putin did not materialize , according to senior officials .
however , putin did warn nato members not to beef up european security at russia 's expense .
-lrb- 04.04.2008 -rrb- nato vows to bolster troops in afghanistan nato allies meeting in romania at a major alliance summit reconfirmed their " long-term commitment " to afghanistan and pledged to substantially beef up troop numbers in the country .

but speculation in his native germany is mounting that he will return for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall in 2009 . during a private audience on thursday , april 3 , dieter althaus , the premier of german state thuringia , invited the pope to return to his home country .
though althaus ' spokesman said the pontiff was " basically open " to the idea , the head of the catholic church has yet to make an official decision . a tour of the former east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trip to erfurt would likely include mass at the cathedral of mary still , the mass-circulation tabloid bild reported friday that the journey would occur in mid-april 2009 .
the anticipated trip would combine celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the 60th anniversary of the passage of germany 's democratic constitution . it would also likely be limited to the cities of berlin and erfurt , thuringia 's capital .
in the heart of the communist former east germany , thuringia is the center of the cult of st. elizabeth of hungary -lrb- 1207-1231 -rrb- , who was born to a royal family and dedicated her life for the poor and sick . erfurt is also a place where catholics are few .
a visit there may be seen as a political move among germans , one-third of whom describe themselves as catholic .
althaus , however , said he would like the visit to focus on the role of the church in a globalized world and the position of the family in society . speculation about a fresh visit first peaked in february .
catholic church figures have asked benedict to visit , but the diocese of erfurt said thursday there was no official confirmation that the pope had accepted those invitations . a rare visit visits abroad by the 80-year-old pope are rare .
he has only three trips outside of italy scheduled for this year , including a much-publicized tour to the united states in mid-april .
during that trip , the former german cardinal joseph ratzinger will be touring a synagogue before the jewish high holiday of passover , a move intended to show good will to the jewish people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff was in cologne for world youth day in 2005 pope benedict xvi sparked controversy recently when he approved a revised version of a good friday mass in latin that includes a line asking god to help jews " acknowledge jesus christ as the savior . " a return to germany would mark the third visit for the pontiff since he ascended in 2005 .

tensions between the alliance and russia were eased somewhat , although differences of opinion still remain . it was nato 's biggest ever summit , held in an correspondingly huge venue - bucharest 's huge palace of the parliament .
and while issues like nato expansion and a us missile defense shield still divided the alliance and russia , moscow and the western pact are still on friendly terms and progress was made in several key areas . nato countries agreed to strengthen their defenses against cyber-attacks , launched a new television channel and smoothed over differences over the mission in afghanistan with a " vision statement . " russian president vladimir putin made his final appearance at a nato summit as president - he steps down next month - and nato leaders had praise for the positive mood after a 90-minute meeting on friday with the russian leader .
while no breakthroughs were forthcoming on disputes ranging from kosovo to a planned us missile shield in eastern europe , the meeting did warm relations that had become distinctly chilly . putin did criticize the western military pact for promising georgia and ukraine eventual membership , although nato did not go so far as to put former soviet states georgia and ukraine on a definite track for membership by granting them so-called membership action plans . positive spin still , both sides chose to put the accent on the positive . " the discussion was frank and open , there was no hiding of views but the spirit was positive , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters after the meeting . german chancellor angela merkel also played down any tension between russia and the defense alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin addresses the media on the third day of the nato summit " nato is not anti-anyone , especially not anti-russia , " she said after the meeting with putin .
she said russia was a partner , calling for a closer relationship and more frequent meetings between nato leaders and russia 's president . merkel emerged from the meeting with an even stronger reputation as a skilled diplomat .
according to the dpa news agency , several of her colleagues in bucharest noted her impressive negotiating prowess . frank words according to a source from the russian delegation who was at the friday meeting , putin lashed out at some nato countries for " demonizing " moscow and failing to reward russia for helping end the cold war . " some went as far as total demonization of russia and ca n't get away from this even now .
some began to talk about imperial ambitions , " putin told nato leaders at the summit , the source said , who asked not to be named . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush talks with germany 's angela merkel putin said that russia had peacefully withdrawn from eastern europe after the soviet collapse and " of course expected something in return .
but this did n't come . " putin also challenged american policy toward iran and said that the islamic republic , instead of being threatened , should be helped to emerge from isolation . " no one can seriously think that iran would dare attack the united states , " the source quoted putin as telling leaders .
" instead of pushing iran into a corner , it would be far more sensible to think together how to help iran become more predictable and transparent . " cyber defense in an attempt to meet new types of warfare , nato acknowledged the growing threat from cyber-attacks and committed themselves to " strengthening key alliance information systems " and to rush to one another 's defense in case of a assault conducted by computer . bildunterschrift : in april 2007 , estonia 's computer servers were hit by a massive , coordinated attack that almost crippled the baltic country 's banks and government services .
estonia 's firewalls successfully withstood the assault , which was blamed on russia hackers . over the new few months , nato allies and estonia are to set up a cyber defense center of excellence in tallinn .
nato officials say that the alliance has a duty to protect sensitive targets such as financial and communication centers . " if one of our allies comes under attack , we need to be prepared , " one nato official told the dpa news agency . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 04.04.2008 opinion : lots of surprises at nato summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato leaders openly discussed their differences at the bucharest summit .
while they failed to find a compromise , unscripted debates were already quite a novel thing , says dw 's bernd riegert . the big enlargement summit that nato 's leading power and many new eastern european members had wished for has fallen through .
germany and france thwarted us plans and candidates ukraine and georgia were sent back to the waiting room . the conflict between the us and western european countries was openly talked about at the summit .
that 's a new thing for nato , since usually decisions are already made beforehand and everything happens according to plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time , however , the outgoing american president was stymied in his almost missionary expansion zeal .
another unusual aspect of the meeting in bucharest was the fact that 25 nato countries were unable to get greece and macedonia to agree on a compromise in the bizarre twist over macedonia 's name .
that 's why only croatia and albania were invited to become members .
george w. bush , the lame duck , did n't manage to have his way against greece , either . the macedonian name controversy should be seen as an operational accident .
nothing has changed as far as nato 's fundamental readiness to welcome all balkan countries into the stabilizing community is concerned and that 's a good thing .
bosnia-herzegovina , montenegro and serbia were all given a clear perspective - what 's still unclear is how long it will take for all of them to sit at the table . the summit 's surprise was german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy 's newly revived close cooperation .
they obviously want to shift nato 's focus towards europe .
france 's return to nato 's military command structures in the coming year fits into that strategy .
it now depends on who will win the race to the white house and what level of importance the new administration will place on the alliance . an overly confident russian president vladimir putin has gained astonishing influence over nato during his last years of neo-nationalistic foreign policy .
the expansion to include ukraine and georgia was mainly delayed out of consideration for russian objections - something the denials by germany 's chancellor can not cover up . a framework agreement with the us also secured the kremlin a right to have a say in the matter of strategic missile defense , which naturally does n't present a threat to russia .
but accusations by the us and eastern europe that nato is throwing itself at putin are exaggerated . the nato-russia council offered a big stage to the outgoing president to reiterate his old and unfounded allegation at an emotional press conference .
this is probably meant for the domestic audience in russia - nato diplomats merely shake their heads in disbelief at putin 's behavior . despite all verbal attacks , russia and nato cooperate on a practical level , such as a common missile defense on the battle field or the transport of supplies to afghanistan .
for the first time , nato also discussed the orderly withdrawal from afghanistan , where it has been since 2001 . long overdue guidelines for when the multinational assistance force will hand over to afghans were finally decided on .
in the short term , nato will have to send even more troops to afghanistan to get the security situation under control . the germans will be called upon in the fall at the latest .
in bucharest , the chancellor cleverly managed to avert a debate on an expanded role for the german military in afghanistan , but it can not be avoided forever . bernd riegert covers nato as dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is considered to be the current leader of europe and chancellor angela merkel the continent 's most influential politician , according to a six-nation poll published friday , april 4 .
only the us begs to differ . citizens in the five eu nations surveyed see germany as leader of the bloc , including 57 percent of spaniards and germans , 39 percent of italians and 35 percent of britons , according to the harris interactive poll published by france 24 television and the international herald tribune .
the poll of 6,478 people was conducted online between feb .
27 and march 6 . merkel came out well ahead of president nicolas " bling-bling " sarkozy as europe 's most influential personality - even in france where 38 percent cite the german leader against 18 percent their own president . although sarkozy is doing his best to seize the reins in europe , 68 percent of respondents in france still believe berlin is calling the shots in brussels - and germany is also seen as the country likely to have the most influence on the rest of europe over the next decade . trans-atlantic differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown -lrb- l -rrb- and bush - still close in the united states , meanwhile , perceptions are altogether different , with the much-touted " special relationship " between washington and london still very much in evidence . across the atlantic , a clear majority of 63 percent of americans believe britain to be the current leader of europe , a view shared by 33 percent of britons and 34 percent of italians . us respondents also believed british prime minister gordon brown to have most influence in europe at 23 percent , while sarkozy lags a long way behind with 9 percent and merkel with 8 percent . a potential ms. europe but back in europe , merkel ca n't be topped .
although most british and americans say they would choose former british prime minister tony blair as a potential president of europe , on the continent it is merkel who gets the popular vote , making her the only serving leader to be considered appropriate . the question has particular resonance with the prospect of an election for a newly empowered presidency of the european council looming on the horizon .
according to the lisbon treaty , eu leaders would , in future , choose a president for a 30-month term rather than the current six-month , rotating presidency system . earlier this week , even a high-ranking eu official suggested that merkel would be an ideal candidate to sit at the head of the eu table . " there are few women in the running when it comes to the eu 's top jobs , " said european communications commissioner margot wallstrom , pointing to merkel as a highly capable woman more than eligible for such a post . old europe gathering strength ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing ranks the six-nation poll was published the same week of the nato summit taking place in bucharest , which saw merkel and her sarkozy challenge us president george w. bush over the question of nato 's eastwards expansion , making it clear that berlin firmly opposed nato membership for georgia and ukraine in the short term . bush was forced to abandon his hopes for the two countries , while merkel , together with sarkozy , demonstrated that when germany and france close ranks they have considerable clout . on thursday , the french and german leaders , also announced that their nations would be jointly hosting the alliance 's 60th anniversary summit next year in the eastern french city of strasbourg and its german sister town of kehl , just across the rhine river . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is considered to be the current leader of europe and chancellor angela merkel the continent 's most influential politician , according to a six-nation poll published friday , april 4 .
only the us begs to differ . citizens in the five eu nations surveyed see germany as leader of the bloc , including 57 percent of spaniards and germans , 39 percent of italians and 35 percent of britons , according to the harris interactive poll published by france 24 television and the international herald tribune .
the poll of 6,478 people was conducted online between feb .
27 and march 6 . merkel came out well ahead of president nicolas " bling-bling " sarkozy as europe 's most influential personality - even in france where 38 percent cite the german leader against 18 percent their own president . although sarkozy is doing his best to seize the reins in europe , 68 percent of respondents in france still believe berlin is calling the shots in brussels - and germany is also seen as the country likely to have the most influence on the rest of europe over the next decade . trans-atlantic differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown -lrb- l -rrb- and bush - still close in the united states , meanwhile , perceptions are altogether different , with the much-touted " special relationship " between washington and london still very much in evidence . across the atlantic , a clear majority of 63 percent of americans believe britain to be the current leader of europe , a view shared by 33 percent of britons and 34 percent of italians . us respondents also believed british prime minister gordon brown to have most influence in europe at 23 percent , while sarkozy lags a long way behind with 9 percent and merkel with 8 percent . a potential ms. europe but back in europe , merkel ca n't be topped .
although most british and americans say they would choose former british prime minister tony blair as a potential president of europe , on the continent it is merkel who gets the popular vote , making her the only serving leader to be considered appropriate . the question has particular resonance with the prospect of an election for a newly empowered presidency of the european council looming on the horizon .
according to the lisbon treaty , eu leaders would , in future , choose a president for a 30-month term rather than the current six-month , rotating presidency system . earlier this week , even a high-ranking eu official suggested that merkel would be an ideal candidate to sit at the head of the eu table . " there are few women in the running when it comes to the eu 's top jobs , " said european communications commissioner margot wallstrom , pointing to merkel as a highly capable woman more than eligible for such a post . old europe gathering strength ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing ranks the six-nation poll was published the same week of the nato summit taking place in bucharest , which saw merkel and her sarkozy challenge us president george w. bush over the question of nato 's eastwards expansion , making it clear that berlin firmly opposed nato membership for georgia and ukraine in the short term . bush was forced to abandon his hopes for the two countries , while merkel , together with sarkozy , demonstrated that when germany and france close ranks they have considerable clout . on thursday , the french and german leaders , also announced that their nations would be jointly hosting the alliance 's 60th anniversary summit next year in the eastern french city of strasbourg and its german sister town of kehl , just across the rhine river . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have signed a memorandum of understanding on financial stability and cooperation in order to ensure stability , " said slovenian finance minister andrej bajuk after chairing a meeting with eu finance ministers and central bankers in the city of brdo .
under the agreement , public bailouts would be sought only if an institution 's troubles threatened the broader economy and there there were no private sector solution , according to the agreement .
" the use of public money to resolve a crisis can never be taken for granted and will only be considered to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy , " the document says .
" the management of an ailing institution will be held accountable , shareholders will not be bailed out and creditors and uninsured depositors should expect to face losses , " it says .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet said that european central banks ' assistance to troubled institutions was limited to situations " where there is a liquidity problem and not a solvency problem . "
minister cautions against " hysteria " arriving in the town of brdo to meet with his colleagues on friday , april 4 , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said that there was no point in getting too worked up over the current problems . " it 's going to keep us busy throughout 2008 , but i advise against getting hysterical about it , " steinbrueck told reporters . along with a record-strong euro , the bloc is also faced with sky-high inflation , which rose to 3.5 percent in march , the highest level since the euro zone was formed in 1999 . while saying that the situation was likely to get even worse , luxembourg 's premier and finance minster jean-claude juncker also tried to look on the bright side .
he said that the international monetary fund 's decision to lower the euro zone 's growth forecast to 1.3 percent for 2008 was " too pessimistic . " but juncker , who also heads the group of euro zone finance ministers , said that he did expect the eu commission to also lower its forecast from the current level of 1.8 percent . structural problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans keep getting less for more euros slovenia 's finance minister , andrej bajuk , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , meanwhile said that there definitely was concern about the current inflation within the bloc . " the changes that we are now seeing seem every day more of a structural nature than just a question of short-term development , " he said . jean-claude trichet has said that employers , including governments , should keep wage hikes moderate to avoid further inflation , according to ap news service . is ecb the problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the ecb partially to blame ?
the head of the imf , dominique strauss-kahn , on the other hand said that believes the real problem of the euro , as well as being overvalued , is the all powerful position of the european central bank . in monday 's edition of le monde , strauss-kahn said " the problem of the euro is that the european central bank , which has worked well to contain inflation , is all powerful . " " there is no counterweight in the shape of a real european finance minister who would be tasked with ensuring growth , " he told the newspaper . there have been persistent calls , especially in france , for the ecb to cut interest rates to bolster a slowing economy , but the bank has insisted that inflation remains the main threat and lending costs must remain high as a result . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

environmental protection groups supported the move . " we will not do it , " gabriel , a social democrat , told the television channel ard on friday , april 4 .
" it is not a measure dealing with environmental policy , but a measure destined to aid the automobile industry . " the news dealt a blow to so-called green fuels , which have been seen as a way to reduce global warming by reducing carbon dioxide emissions . mixing plant-based ethanol with fossil gasoline can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide , one of several so-called greenhouse gases that exacerbate climate change . but ecologists have complained about the practice not least because a number of countries destroy tropical rain forests in order to cultivate the plants used to make biofuels . damaging older cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers would pay the price , had the plans gone ahead germany had initially hailed biofuel blending as a way of achieving reductions in greenhouse gases without imposing restrictions proposed by the eu , which could hit the country 's performance car industry . the german e10 project was supposed to ensure that 10 percent of petrol used by cars and light trucks in germany was comprised of ethanol by 2009 . the initiative formed the cornerstone of berlin 's ambitious climate change policy package laid out in 2007 , designed to cut emissions 40 percent by 2020 at a cost of 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- . but politicians and industry groups had criticized the plans to raise the level to 10 percent for some gasoline grades from 5 percent , saying that the increase would damage older cars because the biofuels were more corrosive than conventional petrol and threatened to wear out certain engine parts too quickly . meanwhile , otmar bernhard , environment minister in bavaria from the conservative csu party , called the blending plans " climate policy hot air . " passing the buck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old cars would be hardest hit gabriel said he would abandon the project if the number of vehicles that could not use the fuel surpassed 1 million . on friday he said the number had exceeded 3 million and that these cars were not ready for the new fuel and could be forced to switch to more expensive , unblended gasoline grades because of possible damage .
most of the cars in question are imported . the environment minister said he feared the change could hit lower earners who generally own older cars . " our environmental policy does not want to be responsible for driving millions of car drivers ... to expensive super plus petrol pumps , " he told the mass-circulation bild tabloid . gabriel blamed the car industry for the switch in policy , saying it had revised its figures . the german automakers association vda had said thursday that the number was much lower , at around 360,000 , and that the jump in affected automobile was due to imported cars .

tensions between the alliance and russia were eased somewhat , although differences of opinion still remain . it was nato 's biggest ever summit , held in an correspondingly huge venue - bucharest 's huge palace of the parliament .
and while issues like nato expansion and a us missile defense shield still divided the alliance and russia , moscow and the western pact are still on friendly terms and progress was made in several key areas . nato countries agreed to strengthen their defenses against cyber-attacks , launched a new television channel and smoothed over differences over the mission in afghanistan with a " vision statement . " russian president vladimir putin made his final appearance at a nato summit as president - he steps down next month - and nato leaders had praise for the positive mood after a 90-minute meeting on friday with the russian leader .
while no breakthroughs were forthcoming on disputes ranging from kosovo to a planned us missile shield in eastern europe , the meeting did warm relations that had become distinctly chilly . putin did criticize the western military pact for promising georgia and ukraine eventual membership , although nato did not go so far as to put former soviet states georgia and ukraine on a definite track for membership by granting them so-called membership action plans . positive spin still , both sides chose to put the accent on the positive . " the discussion was frank and open , there was no hiding of views but the spirit was positive , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters after the meeting . german chancellor angela merkel also played down any tension between russia and the defense alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin addresses the media on the third day of the nato summit " nato is not anti-anyone , especially not anti-russia , " she said after the meeting with putin .
she said russia was a partner , calling for a closer relationship and more frequent meetings between nato leaders and russia 's president . merkel emerged from the meeting with an even stronger reputation as a skilled diplomat .
according to the dpa news agency , several of her colleagues in bucharest noted her impressive negotiating prowess . frank words according to a source from the russian delegation who was at the friday meeting , putin lashed out at some nato countries for " demonizing " moscow and failing to reward russia for helping end the cold war . " some went as far as total demonization of russia and ca n't get away from this even now .
some began to talk about imperial ambitions , " putin told nato leaders at the summit , the source said , who asked not to be named . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush talks with germany 's angela merkel putin said that russia had peacefully withdrawn from eastern europe after the soviet collapse and " of course expected something in return .
but this did n't come . " putin also challenged american policy toward iran and said that the islamic republic , instead of being threatened , should be helped to emerge from isolation . " no one can seriously think that iran would dare attack the united states , " the source quoted putin as telling leaders .
" instead of pushing iran into a corner , it would be far more sensible to think together how to help iran become more predictable and transparent . " cyber defense in an attempt to meet new types of warfare , nato acknowledged the growing threat from cyber-attacks and committed themselves to " strengthening key alliance information systems " and to rush to one another 's defense in case of a assault conducted by computer . bildunterschrift : in april 2007 , estonia 's computer servers were hit by a massive , coordinated attack that almost crippled the baltic country 's banks and government services .
estonia 's firewalls successfully withstood the assault , which was blamed on russia hackers . over the new few months , nato allies and estonia are to set up a cyber defense center of excellence in tallinn .
nato officials say that the alliance has a duty to protect sensitive targets such as financial and communication centers . " if one of our allies comes under attack , we need to be prepared , " one nato official told the dpa news agency . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but speculation in his native germany is mounting that he will return for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall in 2009 . during a private audience on thursday , april 3 , dieter althaus , the premier of german state thuringia , invited the pope to return to his home country .
though althaus ' spokesman said the pontiff was " basically open " to the idea , the head of the catholic church has yet to make an official decision . a tour of the former east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trip to erfurt would likely include mass at the cathedral of mary still , the mass-circulation tabloid bild reported friday that the journey would occur in mid-april 2009 .
the anticipated trip would combine celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the 60th anniversary of the passage of germany 's democratic constitution . it would also likely be limited to the cities of berlin and erfurt , thuringia 's capital .
in the heart of the communist former east germany , thuringia is the center of the cult of st. elizabeth of hungary -lrb- 1207-1231 -rrb- , who was born to a royal family and dedicated her life for the poor and sick . erfurt is also a place where catholics are few .
a visit there may be seen as a political move among germans , one-third of whom describe themselves as catholic .
althaus , however , said he would like the visit to focus on the role of the church in a globalized world and the position of the family in society . speculation about a fresh visit first peaked in february .
catholic church figures have asked benedict to visit , but the diocese of erfurt said thursday there was no official confirmation that the pope had accepted those invitations . a rare visit visits abroad by the 80-year-old pope are rare .
he has only three trips outside of italy scheduled for this year , including a much-publicized tour to the united states in mid-april .
during that trip , the former german cardinal joseph ratzinger will be touring a synagogue before the jewish high holiday of passover , a move intended to show good will to the jewish people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff was in cologne for world youth day in 2005 pope benedict xvi sparked controversy recently when he approved a revised version of a good friday mass in latin that includes a line asking god to help jews " acknowledge jesus christ as the savior . " a return to germany would mark the third visit for the pontiff since he ascended in 2005 .
his visit to cologne in 2005 as part of world youth day , a catholic youth convention , was received by a crowd of nearly 1 million - a record in the convention 's 20-year history . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

environmental protection groups supported the move . " we will not do it , " gabriel , a social democrat , told the television channel ard on friday , april 4 .
" it is not a measure dealing with environmental policy , but a measure destined to aid the automobile industry . " the news dealt a blow to so-called green fuels , which have been seen as a way to reduce global warming by reducing carbon dioxide emissions . mixing plant-based ethanol with fossil gasoline can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide , one of several so-called greenhouse gases that exacerbate climate change . but ecologists have complained about the practice not least because a number of countries destroy tropical rain forests in order to cultivate the plants used to make biofuels . damaging older cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers would pay the price , had the plans gone ahead germany had initially hailed biofuel blending as a way of achieving reductions in greenhouse gases without imposing restrictions proposed by the eu , which could hit the country 's performance car industry . the german e10 project was supposed to ensure that 10 percent of petrol used by cars and light trucks in germany was comprised of ethanol by 2009 . the initiative formed the cornerstone of berlin 's ambitious climate change policy package laid out in 2007 , designed to cut emissions 40 percent by 2020 at a cost of 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- . but politicians and industry groups had criticized the plans to raise the level to 10 percent for some gasoline grades from 5 percent , saying that the increase would damage older cars because the biofuels were more corrosive than conventional petrol and threatened to wear out certain engine parts too quickly . meanwhile , otmar bernhard , environment minister in bavaria from the conservative csu party , called the blending plans " climate policy hot air . " passing the buck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old cars would be hardest hit gabriel said he would abandon the project if the number of vehicles that could not use the fuel surpassed 1 million . on friday he said the number had exceeded 3 million and that these cars were not ready for the new fuel and could be forced to switch to more expensive , unblended gasoline grades because of possible damage .
most of the cars in question are imported . the environment minister said he feared the change could hit lower earners who generally own older cars . " our environmental policy does not want to be responsible for driving millions of car drivers ... to expensive super plus petrol pumps , " he told the mass-circulation bild tabloid . gabriel blamed the car industry for the switch in policy , saying it had revised its figures . the german automakers association vda had said thursday that the number was much lower , at around 360,000 , and that the jump in affected automobile was due to imported cars . " the german automotive industry has done its homework and stuck to its word , " vda president matthias wissmann said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is considered to be the current leader of europe and chancellor angela merkel the continent 's most influential politician , according to a six-nation poll published friday , april 4 .
only the us begs to differ . citizens in the five eu nations surveyed see germany as leader of the bloc , including 57 percent of spaniards and germans , 39 percent of italians and 35 percent of britons , according to the harris interactive poll published by france 24 television and the international herald tribune .
the poll of 6,478 people was conducted online between feb .
27 and march 6 . merkel came out well ahead of president nicolas " bling-bling " sarkozy as europe 's most influential personality - even in france where 38 percent cite the german leader against 18 percent their own president . although sarkozy is doing his best to seize the reins in europe , 68 percent of respondents in france still believe berlin is calling the shots in brussels - and germany is also seen as the country likely to have the most influence on the rest of europe over the next decade . trans-atlantic differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown -lrb- l -rrb- and bush - still close in the united states , meanwhile , perceptions are altogether different , with the much-touted " special relationship " between washington and london still very much in evidence . across the atlantic , a clear majority of 63 percent of americans believe britain to be the current leader of europe , a view shared by 33 percent of britons and 34 percent of italians . us respondents also believed british prime minister gordon brown to have most influence in europe at 23 percent , while sarkozy lags a long way behind with 9 percent and merkel with 8 percent . a potential ms. europe but back in europe , merkel ca n't be topped .
although most british and americans say they would choose former british prime minister tony blair as a potential president of europe , on the continent it is merkel who gets the popular vote , making her the only serving leader to be considered appropriate . the question has particular resonance with the prospect of an election for a newly empowered presidency of the european council looming on the horizon .
according to the lisbon treaty , eu leaders would , in future , choose a president for a 30-month term rather than the current six-month , rotating presidency system . earlier this week , even a high-ranking eu official suggested that merkel would be an ideal candidate to sit at the head of the eu table . " there are few women in the running when it comes to the eu 's top jobs , " said european communications commissioner margot wallstrom , pointing to merkel as a highly capable woman more than eligible for such a post . old europe gathering strength ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing ranks the six-nation poll was published the same week of the nato summit taking place in bucharest , which saw merkel and her sarkozy challenge us president george w. bush over the question of nato 's eastwards expansion , making it clear that berlin firmly opposed nato membership for georgia and ukraine in the short term . bush was forced to abandon his hopes for the two countries , while merkel , together with sarkozy , demonstrated that when germany and france close ranks they have considerable clout . on thursday , the french and german leaders , also announced that their nations would be jointly hosting the alliance 's 60th anniversary summit next year in the eastern french city of strasbourg and its german sister town of kehl , just across the rhine river . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is considered to be the current leader of europe and chancellor angela merkel the continent 's most influential politician , according to a six-nation poll published friday , april 4 .
only the us begs to differ . citizens in the five eu nations surveyed see germany as leader of the bloc , including 57 percent of spaniards and germans , 39 percent of italians and 35 percent of britons , according to the harris interactive poll published by france 24 television and the international herald tribune .
the poll of 6,478 people was conducted online between feb .
27 and march 6 . merkel came out well ahead of president nicolas " bling-bling " sarkozy as europe 's most influential personality - even in france where 38 percent cite the german leader against 18 percent their own president . although sarkozy is doing his best to seize the reins in europe , 68 percent of respondents in france still believe berlin is calling the shots in brussels - and germany is also seen as the country likely to have the most influence on the rest of europe over the next decade . trans-atlantic differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown -lrb- l -rrb- and bush - still close in the united states , meanwhile , perceptions are altogether different , with the much-touted " special relationship " between washington and london still very much in evidence . across the atlantic , a clear majority of 63 percent of americans believe britain to be the current leader of europe , a view shared by 33 percent of britons and 34 percent of italians . us respondents also believed british prime minister gordon brown to have most influence in europe at 23 percent , while sarkozy lags a long way behind with 9 percent and merkel with 8 percent . a potential ms. europe but back in europe , merkel ca n't be topped .
although most british and americans say they would choose former british prime minister tony blair as a potential president of europe , on the continent it is merkel who gets the popular vote , making her the only serving leader to be considered appropriate . the question has particular resonance with the prospect of an election for a newly empowered presidency of the european council looming on the horizon .
according to the lisbon treaty , eu leaders would , in future , choose a president for a 30-month term rather than the current six-month , rotating presidency system . earlier this week , even a high-ranking eu official suggested that merkel would be an ideal candidate to sit at the head of the eu table . " there are few women in the running when it comes to the eu 's top jobs , " said european communications commissioner margot wallstrom , pointing to merkel as a highly capable woman more than eligible for such a post . old europe gathering strength ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing ranks the six-nation poll was published the same week of the nato summit taking place in bucharest , which saw merkel and her sarkozy challenge us president george w. bush over the question of nato 's eastwards expansion , making it clear that berlin firmly opposed nato membership for georgia and ukraine in the short term . bush was forced to abandon his hopes for the two countries , while merkel , together with sarkozy , demonstrated that when germany and france close ranks they have considerable clout . on thursday , the french and german leaders , also announced that their nations would be jointly hosting the alliance 's 60th anniversary summit next year in the eastern french city of strasbourg and its german sister town of kehl , just across the rhine river . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" no one can seriously think that iran would dare attack the united states , " the source quoted putin as telling leaders .
" instead of pushing iran into a corner , it would be far more sensible to think together how to help iran become more predictable and transparent . " cyber defense in an attempt to meet new types of warfare , nato acknowledged the growing threat from cyber-attacks and committed themselves to " strengthening key alliance information systems " and to rush to one another 's defense in case of a assault conducted by computer . bildunterschrift : in april 2007 , estonia 's computer servers were hit by a massive , coordinated attack that almost crippled the baltic country 's banks and government services .
estonia 's firewalls successfully withstood the assault , which was blamed on russia hackers . over the new few months , nato allies and estonia are to set up a cyber defense center of excellence in tallinn .
nato officials say that the alliance has a duty to protect sensitive targets such as financial and communication centers . " if one of our allies comes under attack , we need to be prepared , " one nato official told the dpa news agency . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while they failed to find a compromise , unscripted debates were already quite a novel thing , says dw 's bernd riegert . the big enlargement summit that nato 's leading power and many new eastern european members had wished for has fallen through .
germany and france thwarted us plans and candidates ukraine and georgia were sent back to the waiting room . the conflict between the us and western european countries was openly talked about at the summit .
that 's a new thing for nato , since usually decisions are already made beforehand and everything happens according to plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time , however , the outgoing american president was stymied in his almost missionary expansion zeal .
another unusual aspect of the meeting in bucharest was the fact that 25 nato countries were unable to get greece and macedonia to agree on a compromise in the bizarre twist over macedonia 's name .
that 's why only croatia and albania were invited to become members .
george w. bush , the lame duck , did n't manage to have his way against greece , either . the macedonian name controversy should be seen as an operational accident .
nothing has changed as far as nato 's fundamental readiness to welcome all balkan countries into the stabilizing community is concerned and that 's a good thing .
bosnia-herzegovina , montenegro and serbia were all given a clear perspective - what 's still unclear is how long it will take for all of them to sit at the table . the summit 's surprise was german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy 's newly revived close cooperation .
they obviously want to shift nato 's focus towards europe .
france 's return to nato 's military command structures in the coming year fits into that strategy .
it now depends on who will win the race to the white house and what level of importance the new administration will place on the alliance . an overly confident russian president vladimir putin has gained astonishing influence over nato during his last years of neo-nationalistic foreign policy .
the expansion to include ukraine and georgia was mainly delayed out of consideration for russian objections - something the denials by germany 's chancellor can not cover up . a framework agreement with the us also secured the kremlin a right to have a say in the matter of strategic missile defense , which naturally does n't present a threat to russia .
but accusations by the us and eastern europe that nato is throwing itself at putin are exaggerated . the nato-russia council offered a big stage to the outgoing president to reiterate his old and unfounded allegation at an emotional press conference .
this is probably meant for the domestic audience in russia - nato diplomats merely shake their heads in disbelief at putin 's behavior . despite all verbal attacks , russia and nato cooperate on a practical level , such as a common missile defense on the battle field or the transport of supplies to afghanistan .
for the first time , nato also discussed the orderly withdrawal from afghanistan , where it has been since 2001 . long overdue guidelines for when the multinational assistance force will hand over to afghans were finally decided on .
in the short term , nato will have to send even more troops to afghanistan to get the security situation under control . the germans will be called upon in the fall at the latest .

another unusual aspect of the meeting in bucharest was the fact that 25 nato countries were unable to get greece and macedonia to agree on a compromise in the bizarre twist over macedonia 's name .
that 's why only croatia and albania were invited to become members .
george w. bush , the lame duck , did n't manage to have his way against greece , either . the macedonian name controversy should be seen as an operational accident .
nothing has changed as far as nato 's fundamental readiness to welcome all balkan countries into the stabilizing community is concerned and that 's a good thing .
bosnia-herzegovina , montenegro and serbia were all given a clear perspective - what 's still unclear is how long it will take for all of them to sit at the table . the summit 's surprise was german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy 's newly revived close cooperation .
they obviously want to shift nato 's focus towards europe .
france 's return to nato 's military command structures in the coming year fits into that strategy .
it now depends on who will win the race to the white house and what level of importance the new administration will place on the alliance . an overly confident russian president vladimir putin has gained astonishing influence over nato during his last years of neo-nationalistic foreign policy .
the expansion to include ukraine and georgia was mainly delayed out of consideration for russian objections - something the denials by germany 's chancellor can not cover up . a framework agreement with the us also secured the kremlin a right to have a say in the matter of strategic missile defense , which naturally does n't present a threat to russia .
but accusations by the us and eastern europe that nato is throwing itself at putin are exaggerated . the nato-russia council offered a big stage to the outgoing president to reiterate his old and unfounded allegation at an emotional press conference .
this is probably meant for the domestic audience in russia - nato diplomats merely shake their heads in disbelief at putin 's behavior . despite all verbal attacks , russia and nato cooperate on a practical level , such as a common missile defense on the battle field or the transport of supplies to afghanistan .
for the first time , nato also discussed the orderly withdrawal from afghanistan , where it has been since 2001 . long overdue guidelines for when the multinational assistance force will hand over to afghans were finally decided on .
in the short term , nato will have to send even more troops to afghanistan to get the security situation under control . the germans will be called upon in the fall at the latest .
in bucharest , the chancellor cleverly managed to avert a debate on an expanded role for the german military in afghanistan , but it can not be avoided forever . bernd riegert covers nato as dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have signed a memorandum of understanding on financial stability and cooperation in order to ensure stability , " said slovenian finance minister andrej bajuk after chairing a meeting with eu finance ministers and central bankers in the city of brdo .
under the agreement , public bailouts would be sought only if an institution 's troubles threatened the broader economy and there there were no private sector solution , according to the agreement .
" the use of public money to resolve a crisis can never be taken for granted and will only be considered to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy , " the document says .
" the management of an ailing institution will be held accountable , shareholders will not be bailed out and creditors and uninsured depositors should expect to face losses , " it says .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet said that european central banks ' assistance to troubled institutions was limited to situations " where there is a liquidity problem and not a solvency problem . "
minister cautions against " hysteria " arriving in the town of brdo to meet with his colleagues on friday , april 4 , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said that there was no point in getting too worked up over the current problems . " it 's going to keep us busy throughout 2008 , but i advise against getting hysterical about it , " steinbrueck told reporters . along with a record-strong euro , the bloc is also faced with sky-high inflation , which rose to 3.5 percent in march , the highest level since the euro zone was formed in 1999 . while saying that the situation was likely to get even worse , luxembourg 's premier and finance minster jean-claude juncker also tried to look on the bright side .
he said that the international monetary fund 's decision to lower the euro zone 's growth forecast to 1.3 percent for 2008 was " too pessimistic . " but juncker , who also heads the group of euro zone finance ministers , said that he did expect the eu commission to also lower its forecast from the current level of 1.8 percent . structural problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans keep getting less for more euros slovenia 's finance minister , andrej bajuk , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , meanwhile said that there definitely was concern about the current inflation within the bloc . " the changes that we are now seeing seem every day more of a structural nature than just a question of short-term development , " he said . jean-claude trichet has said that employers , including governments , should keep wage hikes moderate to avoid further inflation , according to ap news service . is ecb the problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the ecb partially to blame ?
the head of the imf , dominique strauss-kahn , on the other hand said that believes the real problem of the euro , as well as being overvalued , is the all powerful position of the european central bank . in monday 's edition of le monde , strauss-kahn said " the problem of the euro is that the european central bank , which has worked well to contain inflation , is all powerful . " " there is no counterweight in the shape of a real european finance minister who would be tasked with ensuring growth , " he told the newspaper . there have been persistent calls , especially in france , for the ecb to cut interest rates to bolster a slowing economy , but the bank has insisted that inflation remains the main threat and lending costs must remain high as a result . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but speculation in his native germany is mounting that he will return for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall in 2009 . during a private audience on thursday , april 3 , dieter althaus , the premier of german state thuringia , invited the pope to return to his home country .
though althaus ' spokesman said the pontiff was " basically open " to the idea , the head of the catholic church has yet to make an official decision . a tour of the former east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trip to erfurt would likely include mass at the cathedral of mary still , the mass-circulation tabloid bild reported friday that the journey would occur in mid-april 2009 .
the anticipated trip would combine celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the 60th anniversary of the passage of germany 's democratic constitution . it would also likely be limited to the cities of berlin and erfurt , thuringia 's capital .
in the heart of the communist former east germany , thuringia is the center of the cult of st. elizabeth of hungary -lrb- 1207-1231 -rrb- , who was born to a royal family and dedicated her life for the poor and sick . erfurt is also a place where catholics are few .
a visit there may be seen as a political move among germans , one-third of whom describe themselves as catholic .
althaus , however , said he would like the visit to focus on the role of the church in a globalized world and the position of the family in society . speculation about a fresh visit first peaked in february .
catholic church figures have asked benedict to visit , but the diocese of erfurt said thursday there was no official confirmation that the pope had accepted those invitations . a rare visit visits abroad by the 80-year-old pope are rare .
he has only three trips outside of italy scheduled for this year , including a much-publicized tour to the united states in mid-april .
during that trip , the former german cardinal joseph ratzinger will be touring a synagogue before the jewish high holiday of passover , a move intended to show good will to the jewish people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff was in cologne for world youth day in 2005 pope benedict xvi sparked controversy recently when he approved a revised version of a good friday mass in latin that includes a line asking god to help jews " acknowledge jesus christ as the savior . " a return to germany would mark the third visit for the pontiff since he ascended in 2005 .
his visit to cologne in 2005 as part of world youth day , a catholic youth convention , was received by a crowd of nearly 1 million - a record in the convention 's 20-year history . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but speculation in his native germany is mounting that he will return for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall in 2009 . during a private audience on thursday , april 3 , dieter althaus , the premier of german state thuringia , invited the pope to return to his home country .

the anticipated trip would combine celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the 60th anniversary of the passage of germany 's democratic constitution . it would also likely be limited to the cities of berlin and erfurt , thuringia 's capital .
in the heart of the communist former east germany , thuringia is the center of the cult of st. elizabeth of hungary -lrb- 1207-1231 -rrb- , who was born to a royal family and dedicated her life for the poor and sick . erfurt is also a place where catholics are few .

catholic church figures have asked benedict to visit , but the diocese of erfurt said thursday there was no official confirmation that the pope had accepted those invitations . a rare visit visits abroad by the 80-year-old pope are rare .
he has only three trips outside of italy scheduled for this year , including a much-publicized tour to the united states in mid-april .

environmental protection groups supported the move . " we will not do it , " gabriel , a social democrat , told the television channel ard on friday , april 4 .
" it is not a measure dealing with environmental policy , but a measure destined to aid the automobile industry . " the news dealt a blow to so-called green fuels , which have been seen as a way to reduce global warming by reducing carbon dioxide emissions . mixing plant-based ethanol with fossil gasoline can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide , one of several so-called greenhouse gases that exacerbate climate change . but ecologists have complained about the practice not least because a number of countries destroy tropical rain forests in order to cultivate the plants used to make biofuels . damaging older cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers would pay the price , had the plans gone ahead germany had initially hailed biofuel blending as a way of achieving reductions in greenhouse gases without imposing restrictions proposed by the eu , which could hit the country 's performance car industry . the german e10 project was supposed to ensure that 10 percent of petrol used by cars and light trucks in germany was comprised of ethanol by 2009 . the initiative formed the cornerstone of berlin 's ambitious climate change policy package laid out in 2007 , designed to cut emissions 40 percent by 2020 at a cost of 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- . but politicians and industry groups had criticized the plans to raise the level to 10 percent for some gasoline grades from 5 percent , saying that the increase would damage older cars because the biofuels were more corrosive than conventional petrol and threatened to wear out certain engine parts too quickly . meanwhile , otmar bernhard , environment minister in bavaria from the conservative csu party , called the blending plans " climate policy hot air . " passing the buck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old cars would be hardest hit gabriel said he would abandon the project if the number of vehicles that could not use the fuel surpassed 1 million . on friday he said the number had exceeded 3 million and that these cars were not ready for the new fuel and could be forced to switch to more expensive , unblended gasoline grades because of possible damage .
most of the cars in question are imported . the environment minister said he feared the change could hit lower earners who generally own older cars . " our environmental policy does not want to be responsible for driving millions of car drivers ... to expensive super plus petrol pumps , " he told the mass-circulation bild tabloid . gabriel blamed the car industry for the switch in policy , saying it had revised its figures . the german automakers association vda had said thursday that the number was much lower , at around 360,000 , and that the jump in affected automobile was due to imported cars . " the german automotive industry has done its homework and stuck to its word , " vda president matthias wissmann said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 04.04.2008 opinion : lots of surprises at nato summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato leaders openly discussed their differences at the bucharest summit .
while they failed to find a compromise , unscripted debates were already quite a novel thing , says dw 's bernd riegert . the big enlargement summit that nato 's leading power and many new eastern european members had wished for has fallen through .
germany and france thwarted us plans and candidates ukraine and georgia were sent back to the waiting room . the conflict between the us and western european countries was openly talked about at the summit .
that 's a new thing for nato , since usually decisions are already made beforehand and everything happens according to plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time , however , the outgoing american president was stymied in his almost missionary expansion zeal .
another unusual aspect of the meeting in bucharest was the fact that 25 nato countries were unable to get greece and macedonia to agree on a compromise in the bizarre twist over macedonia 's name .
that 's why only croatia and albania were invited to become members .
george w. bush , the lame duck , did n't manage to have his way against greece , either . the macedonian name controversy should be seen as an operational accident .
nothing has changed as far as nato 's fundamental readiness to welcome all balkan countries into the stabilizing community is concerned and that 's a good thing .
bosnia-herzegovina , montenegro and serbia were all given a clear perspective - what 's still unclear is how long it will take for all of them to sit at the table . the summit 's surprise was german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy 's newly revived close cooperation .
they obviously want to shift nato 's focus towards europe .
france 's return to nato 's military command structures in the coming year fits into that strategy .
it now depends on who will win the race to the white house and what level of importance the new administration will place on the alliance . an overly confident russian president vladimir putin has gained astonishing influence over nato during his last years of neo-nationalistic foreign policy .
the expansion to include ukraine and georgia was mainly delayed out of consideration for russian objections - something the denials by germany 's chancellor can not cover up . a framework agreement with the us also secured the kremlin a right to have a say in the matter of strategic missile defense , which naturally does n't present a threat to russia .
but accusations by the us and eastern europe that nato is throwing itself at putin are exaggerated . the nato-russia council offered a big stage to the outgoing president to reiterate his old and unfounded allegation at an emotional press conference .
this is probably meant for the domestic audience in russia - nato diplomats merely shake their heads in disbelief at putin 's behavior . despite all verbal attacks , russia and nato cooperate on a practical level , such as a common missile defense on the battle field or the transport of supplies to afghanistan .
for the first time , nato also discussed the orderly withdrawal from afghanistan , where it has been since 2001 . long overdue guidelines for when the multinational assistance force will hand over to afghans were finally decided on .
in the short term , nato will have to send even more troops to afghanistan to get the security situation under control . the germans will be called upon in the fall at the latest .
in bucharest , the chancellor cleverly managed to avert a debate on an expanded role for the german military in afghanistan , but it can not be avoided forever . bernd riegert covers nato as dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de nato summit ends on positive note , fails to heal rifts a feared showdown friday between nato and russian president vladimir putin did not materialize , according to senior officials .
however , putin did warn nato members not to beef up european security at russia 's expense .
-lrb- 04.04.2008 -rrb- nato vows to bolster troops in afghanistan nato allies meeting in romania at a major alliance summit reconfirmed their " long-term commitment " to afghanistan and pledged to substantially beef up troop numbers in the country .
-lrb- 03.04.2008 -rrb- nato 's eastward expansion rift to dominate summit the membership bids of two former soviet republics , georgia and ukraine , backed strongly by us president bush , are set to overshadow a nato summit in romania - much to the displeasure of germany .

environmental protection groups supported the move . " we will not do it , " gabriel , a social democrat , told the television channel ard on friday , april 4 .
" it is not a measure dealing with environmental policy , but a measure destined to aid the automobile industry . " the news dealt a blow to so-called green fuels , which have been seen as a way to reduce global warming by reducing carbon dioxide emissions . mixing plant-based ethanol with fossil gasoline can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide , one of several so-called greenhouse gases that exacerbate climate change . but ecologists have complained about the practice not least because a number of countries destroy tropical rain forests in order to cultivate the plants used to make biofuels . damaging older cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers would pay the price , had the plans gone ahead germany had initially hailed biofuel blending as a way of achieving reductions in greenhouse gases without imposing restrictions proposed by the eu , which could hit the country 's performance car industry . the german e10 project was supposed to ensure that 10 percent of petrol used by cars and light trucks in germany was comprised of ethanol by 2009 . the initiative formed the cornerstone of berlin 's ambitious climate change policy package laid out in 2007 , designed to cut emissions 40 percent by 2020 at a cost of 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- . but politicians and industry groups had criticized the plans to raise the level to 10 percent for some gasoline grades from 5 percent , saying that the increase would damage older cars because the biofuels were more corrosive than conventional petrol and threatened to wear out certain engine parts too quickly . meanwhile , otmar bernhard , environment minister in bavaria from the conservative csu party , called the blending plans " climate policy hot air . " passing the buck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old cars would be hardest hit gabriel said he would abandon the project if the number of vehicles that could not use the fuel surpassed 1 million . on friday he said the number had exceeded 3 million and that these cars were not ready for the new fuel and could be forced to switch to more expensive , unblended gasoline grades because of possible damage .
most of the cars in question are imported . the environment minister said he feared the change could hit lower earners who generally own older cars . " our environmental policy does not want to be responsible for driving millions of car drivers ... to expensive super plus petrol pumps , " he told the mass-circulation bild tabloid . gabriel blamed the car industry for the switch in policy , saying it had revised its figures . the german automakers association vda had said thursday that the number was much lower , at around 360,000 , and that the jump in affected automobile was due to imported cars . " the german automotive industry has done its homework and stuck to its word , " vda president matthias wissmann said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have signed a memorandum of understanding on financial stability and cooperation in order to ensure stability , " said slovenian finance minister andrej bajuk after chairing a meeting with eu finance ministers and central bankers in the city of brdo .
under the agreement , public bailouts would be sought only if an institution 's troubles threatened the broader economy and there there were no private sector solution , according to the agreement .
" the use of public money to resolve a crisis can never be taken for granted and will only be considered to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy , " the document says .
" the management of an ailing institution will be held accountable , shareholders will not be bailed out and creditors and uninsured depositors should expect to face losses , " it says .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet said that european central banks ' assistance to troubled institutions was limited to situations " where there is a liquidity problem and not a solvency problem . "
minister cautions against " hysteria " arriving in the town of brdo to meet with his colleagues on friday , april 4 , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said that there was no point in getting too worked up over the current problems . " it 's going to keep us busy throughout 2008 , but i advise against getting hysterical about it , " steinbrueck told reporters . along with a record-strong euro , the bloc is also faced with sky-high inflation , which rose to 3.5 percent in march , the highest level since the euro zone was formed in 1999 . while saying that the situation was likely to get even worse , luxembourg 's premier and finance minster jean-claude juncker also tried to look on the bright side .
he said that the international monetary fund 's decision to lower the euro zone 's growth forecast to 1.3 percent for 2008 was " too pessimistic . " but juncker , who also heads the group of euro zone finance ministers , said that he did expect the eu commission to also lower its forecast from the current level of 1.8 percent . structural problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans keep getting less for more euros slovenia 's finance minister , andrej bajuk , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , meanwhile said that there definitely was concern about the current inflation within the bloc . " the changes that we are now seeing seem every day more of a structural nature than just a question of short-term development , " he said . jean-claude trichet has said that employers , including governments , should keep wage hikes moderate to avoid further inflation , according to ap news service . is ecb the problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the ecb partially to blame ?
the head of the imf , dominique strauss-kahn , on the other hand said that believes the real problem of the euro , as well as being overvalued , is the all powerful position of the european central bank . in monday 's edition of le monde , strauss-kahn said " the problem of the euro is that the european central bank , which has worked well to contain inflation , is all powerful . " " there is no counterweight in the shape of a real european finance minister who would be tasked with ensuring growth , " he told the newspaper . there have been persistent calls , especially in france , for the ecb to cut interest rates to bolster a slowing economy , but the bank has insisted that inflation remains the main threat and lending costs must remain high as a result . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 04.04.2008 opinion : lots of surprises at nato summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato leaders openly discussed their differences at the bucharest summit .
while they failed to find a compromise , unscripted debates were already quite a novel thing , says dw 's bernd riegert . the big enlargement summit that nato 's leading power and many new eastern european members had wished for has fallen through .
germany and france thwarted us plans and candidates ukraine and georgia were sent back to the waiting room . the conflict between the us and western european countries was openly talked about at the summit .
that 's a new thing for nato , since usually decisions are already made beforehand and everything happens according to plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time , however , the outgoing american president was stymied in his almost missionary expansion zeal .
another unusual aspect of the meeting in bucharest was the fact that 25 nato countries were unable to get greece and macedonia to agree on a compromise in the bizarre twist over macedonia 's name .
that 's why only croatia and albania were invited to become members .
george w. bush , the lame duck , did n't manage to have his way against greece , either . the macedonian name controversy should be seen as an operational accident .
nothing has changed as far as nato 's fundamental readiness to welcome all balkan countries into the stabilizing community is concerned and that 's a good thing .
bosnia-herzegovina , montenegro and serbia were all given a clear perspective - what 's still unclear is how long it will take for all of them to sit at the table . the summit 's surprise was german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy 's newly revived close cooperation .
they obviously want to shift nato 's focus towards europe .
france 's return to nato 's military command structures in the coming year fits into that strategy .
it now depends on who will win the race to the white house and what level of importance the new administration will place on the alliance . an overly confident russian president vladimir putin has gained astonishing influence over nato during his last years of neo-nationalistic foreign policy .
the expansion to include ukraine and georgia was mainly delayed out of consideration for russian objections - something the denials by germany 's chancellor can not cover up . a framework agreement with the us also secured the kremlin a right to have a say in the matter of strategic missile defense , which naturally does n't present a threat to russia .
but accusations by the us and eastern europe that nato is throwing itself at putin are exaggerated . the nato-russia council offered a big stage to the outgoing president to reiterate his old and unfounded allegation at an emotional press conference .
this is probably meant for the domestic audience in russia - nato diplomats merely shake their heads in disbelief at putin 's behavior . despite all verbal attacks , russia and nato cooperate on a practical level , such as a common missile defense on the battle field or the transport of supplies to afghanistan .
for the first time , nato also discussed the orderly withdrawal from afghanistan , where it has been since 2001 . long overdue guidelines for when the multinational assistance force will hand over to afghans were finally decided on .
in the short term , nato will have to send even more troops to afghanistan to get the security situation under control . the germans will be called upon in the fall at the latest .
in bucharest , the chancellor cleverly managed to avert a debate on an expanded role for the german military in afghanistan , but it can not be avoided forever . bernd riegert covers nato as dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de nato summit ends on positive note , fails to heal rifts a feared showdown friday between nato and russian president vladimir putin did not materialize , according to senior officials .
however , putin did warn nato members not to beef up european security at russia 's expense .
-lrb- 04.04.2008 -rrb- nato vows to bolster troops in afghanistan nato allies meeting in romania at a major alliance summit reconfirmed their " long-term commitment " to afghanistan and pledged to substantially beef up troop numbers in the country .
-lrb- 03.04.2008 -rrb- nato 's eastward expansion rift to dominate summit the membership bids of two former soviet republics , georgia and ukraine , backed strongly by us president bush , are set to overshadow a nato summit in romania - much to the displeasure of germany .

while they failed to find a compromise , unscripted debates were already quite a novel thing , says dw 's bernd riegert . the big enlargement summit that nato 's leading power and many new eastern european members had wished for has fallen through .
germany and france thwarted us plans and candidates ukraine and georgia were sent back to the waiting room . the conflict between the us and western european countries was openly talked about at the summit .
that 's a new thing for nato , since usually decisions are already made beforehand and everything happens according to plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time , however , the outgoing american president was stymied in his almost missionary expansion zeal .
another unusual aspect of the meeting in bucharest was the fact that 25 nato countries were unable to get greece and macedonia to agree on a compromise in the bizarre twist over macedonia 's name .
that 's why only croatia and albania were invited to become members .
george w. bush , the lame duck , did n't manage to have his way against greece , either . the macedonian name controversy should be seen as an operational accident .
nothing has changed as far as nato 's fundamental readiness to welcome all balkan countries into the stabilizing community is concerned and that 's a good thing .
bosnia-herzegovina , montenegro and serbia were all given a clear perspective - what 's still unclear is how long it will take for all of them to sit at the table . the summit 's surprise was german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy 's newly revived close cooperation .
they obviously want to shift nato 's focus towards europe .
france 's return to nato 's military command structures in the coming year fits into that strategy .
it now depends on who will win the race to the white house and what level of importance the new administration will place on the alliance . an overly confident russian president vladimir putin has gained astonishing influence over nato during his last years of neo-nationalistic foreign policy .
the expansion to include ukraine and georgia was mainly delayed out of consideration for russian objections - something the denials by germany 's chancellor can not cover up . a framework agreement with the us also secured the kremlin a right to have a say in the matter of strategic missile defense , which naturally does n't present a threat to russia .
but accusations by the us and eastern europe that nato is throwing itself at putin are exaggerated . the nato-russia council offered a big stage to the outgoing president to reiterate his old and unfounded allegation at an emotional press conference .
this is probably meant for the domestic audience in russia - nato diplomats merely shake their heads in disbelief at putin 's behavior . despite all verbal attacks , russia and nato cooperate on a practical level , such as a common missile defense on the battle field or the transport of supplies to afghanistan .
for the first time , nato also discussed the orderly withdrawal from afghanistan , where it has been since 2001 . long overdue guidelines for when the multinational assistance force will hand over to afghans were finally decided on .
in the short term , nato will have to send even more troops to afghanistan to get the security situation under control . the germans will be called upon in the fall at the latest .
in bucharest , the chancellor cleverly managed to avert a debate on an expanded role for the german military in afghanistan , but it can not be avoided forever . bernd riegert covers nato as dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 04.04.2008 opinion : lots of surprises at nato summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato leaders openly discussed their differences at the bucharest summit .
while they failed to find a compromise , unscripted debates were already quite a novel thing , says dw 's bernd riegert . the big enlargement summit that nato 's leading power and many new eastern european members had wished for has fallen through .
germany and france thwarted us plans and candidates ukraine and georgia were sent back to the waiting room . the conflict between the us and western european countries was openly talked about at the summit .
that 's a new thing for nato , since usually decisions are already made beforehand and everything happens according to plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time , however , the outgoing american president was stymied in his almost missionary expansion zeal .
another unusual aspect of the meeting in bucharest was the fact that 25 nato countries were unable to get greece and macedonia to agree on a compromise in the bizarre twist over macedonia 's name .
that 's why only croatia and albania were invited to become members .
george w. bush , the lame duck , did n't manage to have his way against greece , either . the macedonian name controversy should be seen as an operational accident .
nothing has changed as far as nato 's fundamental readiness to welcome all balkan countries into the stabilizing community is concerned and that 's a good thing .
bosnia-herzegovina , montenegro and serbia were all given a clear perspective - what 's still unclear is how long it will take for all of them to sit at the table . the summit 's surprise was german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy 's newly revived close cooperation .
they obviously want to shift nato 's focus towards europe .
france 's return to nato 's military command structures in the coming year fits into that strategy .
it now depends on who will win the race to the white house and what level of importance the new administration will place on the alliance . an overly confident russian president vladimir putin has gained astonishing influence over nato during his last years of neo-nationalistic foreign policy .
the expansion to include ukraine and georgia was mainly delayed out of consideration for russian objections - something the denials by germany 's chancellor can not cover up . a framework agreement with the us also secured the kremlin a right to have a say in the matter of strategic missile defense , which naturally does n't present a threat to russia .
but accusations by the us and eastern europe that nato is throwing itself at putin are exaggerated . the nato-russia council offered a big stage to the outgoing president to reiterate his old and unfounded allegation at an emotional press conference .
this is probably meant for the domestic audience in russia - nato diplomats merely shake their heads in disbelief at putin 's behavior . despite all verbal attacks , russia and nato cooperate on a practical level , such as a common missile defense on the battle field or the transport of supplies to afghanistan .
for the first time , nato also discussed the orderly withdrawal from afghanistan , where it has been since 2001 . long overdue guidelines for when the multinational assistance force will hand over to afghans were finally decided on .
in the short term , nato will have to send even more troops to afghanistan to get the security situation under control . the germans will be called upon in the fall at the latest .
in bucharest , the chancellor cleverly managed to avert a debate on an expanded role for the german military in afghanistan , but it can not be avoided forever . bernd riegert covers nato as dw-radio 's brussels correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de nato summit ends on positive note , fails to heal rifts a feared showdown friday between nato and russian president vladimir putin did not materialize , according to senior officials .
however , putin did warn nato members not to beef up european security at russia 's expense .
-lrb- 04.04.2008 -rrb- nato vows to bolster troops in afghanistan nato allies meeting in romania at a major alliance summit reconfirmed their " long-term commitment " to afghanistan and pledged to substantially beef up troop numbers in the country .
-lrb- 03.04.2008 -rrb- nato 's eastward expansion rift to dominate summit the membership bids of two former soviet republics , georgia and ukraine , backed strongly by us president bush , are set to overshadow a nato summit in romania - much to the displeasure of germany .

but speculation in his native germany is mounting that he will return for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall in 2009 . during a private audience on thursday , april 3 , dieter althaus , the premier of german state thuringia , invited the pope to return to his home country .
though althaus ' spokesman said the pontiff was " basically open " to the idea , the head of the catholic church has yet to make an official decision . a tour of the former east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trip to erfurt would likely include mass at the cathedral of mary still , the mass-circulation tabloid bild reported friday that the journey would occur in mid-april 2009 .
the anticipated trip would combine celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the 60th anniversary of the passage of germany 's democratic constitution . it would also likely be limited to the cities of berlin and erfurt , thuringia 's capital .
in the heart of the communist former east germany , thuringia is the center of the cult of st. elizabeth of hungary -lrb- 1207-1231 -rrb- , who was born to a royal family and dedicated her life for the poor and sick . erfurt is also a place where catholics are few .
a visit there may be seen as a political move among germans , one-third of whom describe themselves as catholic .
althaus , however , said he would like the visit to focus on the role of the church in a globalized world and the position of the family in society . speculation about a fresh visit first peaked in february .
catholic church figures have asked benedict to visit , but the diocese of erfurt said thursday there was no official confirmation that the pope had accepted those invitations . a rare visit visits abroad by the 80-year-old pope are rare .
he has only three trips outside of italy scheduled for this year , including a much-publicized tour to the united states in mid-april .
during that trip , the former german cardinal joseph ratzinger will be touring a synagogue before the jewish high holiday of passover , a move intended to show good will to the jewish people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff was in cologne for world youth day in 2005 pope benedict xvi sparked controversy recently when he approved a revised version of a good friday mass in latin that includes a line asking god to help jews " acknowledge jesus christ as the savior . " a return to germany would mark the third visit for the pontiff since he ascended in 2005 .

the move has stirred deep unease in some quarters . under the 10-year , 7.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- project , a consortium between the bundeswehr and private firms like siemens and ibm is upgrading non-military it and communications infrastructure .
the project involves some 140,000 pcs , 7,000 servers and 300,000 telephones .
the bundeswehr has used the private sector to a limited extent before - chiefly for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
project hercules , currently the largest initiative of its kind in europe , represents a giant leap in scale .
is germany going down the problematic path taken by the us of outsourcing massive sectors of the military to profit-conscious private enterprise ?
the consortium - called bwi information technologies - says no .
" using the private sector has advantages , " bwi chief executive officer peter blaschke said .
" the bundeswehr is dependent on annual parliamentary budgets and can only engage in short-term planning .
with project hercules , we can - for the first time - have a 10-year plan and be flexible with investments .
for example , we 've invested ahead in the first year to get the project off to a fast start .
in addition , we 're securing the know-how of experts over a number of years . "
but some german politicians are monitoring the initiative with an extremely critical eye .
" the privatization of bundeswehr tasks is the wrong way to go , " said paul schaefer , the defense spokesman for the opposition left party 's parliamentary group .
" the private sector can play a role , but the question is who is ultimately responsible for the decision-making , " schaefer added .
" ibm and siemens will want to recoup their money , and there no telling right now whether the project will actually yield savings .
the total price has already gone up from 6.6 to over 7 billion euros , and the whole thing was preceded by five years of costly negotiations . "
lessons from the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bwi 's peter blaschke says project hercules has built-in safeguards project hercules distinguished between " green " -lrb- military -rrb- and " white " -lrb- non-military -rrb- information technology , with bwi only responsible for the latter .
the bundeswehr itself is represented on the board of directors , and the consortium is open to audit by the military , the german defense ministry and the general accountants office .
that 's part of an attempt to avoid repeating mistakes made by the united states .
private military contractors employed by the pentagon have been accused in extreme cases - such as the 2004 torture scandal at the abu ghraib prison in iraq - being involved in human rights abuses .
there have also been allegations of companies over-charging , doing poor work and usurping whole military sectors .
" the bundeswehr has chosen a clever path , " blaschke said .
" this is not a normal business contract , but a mandate for the military to build up its own it company .
the main computer center will not end up at ibm , and the bundeswehr will not fall into the trap of not having the know-how to run its own equipment .
after 10 years , bwi will revert to 100 percent bundeswehr control - that 's specified by the contract . "
but contracts , some fear , can be broken .
" there 's definitely more supervisory administration in germany than in the us , " schaefer said .
" but the question of brain-drain remains .
will the know-how really return to or remain with the bundeswehr once the contract expires ? "
the challenge for the bundeswehr is how to utilize the flexibility and expertise of the private sector without making itself as dependent as the us army , which is sometimes unable to operate and maintain privately designed systems .
the line between green and white bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blackwater employees have been active in combat in iraq the us military is thoroughly entwined with military service providers , which include not just blackwater and halliburton but lesser-known companies like caci or dyncorp .
the industry is highly secretive , but some estimates put the number of private employees in iraq above that of all non-us foreign troops combined - essentially making business the second-largest force in that war-torn country .
especially in the fog of war , it can be difficult to distinguish clearly between military and non-military activities when it comes to private companies .
" in germany , we 're roughly where the us was in the late 1980s and early 1990s in that only civilian , non-military tasks are supposed to be outsourced , " schaefer said .
" but the vehicle maintenance company has already been in bosnia .
and it may probably be just a matter of time until logistics specialists become active in afghanistan as well . "
bwi acknowledges the difficulties of drawing absolute lines between civilian , domestic tasks and foreign , military ones .
but it says there are safeguards .
" bwi will not be active abroad with the bundeswehr , and we 're not involved in things like weapons-guidance systems or it for military command centers , " blaschke said .
" and in a crisis situation , where the lines get blurred , the bundeswehr can assume total responsibility for all areas .
that 's part of the agreement . "
bwi said project hercules has gotten off to an optimal start .
but it will be years down the road before its efficiency can be determined - and the question answered as to whether the bundeswehr has succeeded in maintaining the crucial distinction between civilian and military tasks . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while they failed to find a compromise , unscripted debates were already quite a novel thing , says dw 's bernd riegert . the big enlargement summit that nato 's leading power and many new eastern european members had wished for has fallen through .
germany and france thwarted us plans and candidates ukraine and georgia were sent back to the waiting room . the conflict between the us and western european countries was openly talked about at the summit .
that 's a new thing for nato , since usually decisions are already made beforehand and everything happens according to plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time , however , the outgoing american president was stymied in his almost missionary expansion zeal .
another unusual aspect of the meeting in bucharest was the fact that 25 nato countries were unable to get greece and macedonia to agree on a compromise in the bizarre twist over macedonia 's name .
that 's why only croatia and albania were invited to become members .
george w. bush , the lame duck , did n't manage to have his way against greece , either . the macedonian name controversy should be seen as an operational accident .
nothing has changed as far as nato 's fundamental readiness to welcome all balkan countries into the stabilizing community is concerned and that 's a good thing .
bosnia-herzegovina , montenegro and serbia were all given a clear perspective - what 's still unclear is how long it will take for all of them to sit at the table . the summit 's surprise was german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy 's newly revived close cooperation .
they obviously want to shift nato 's focus towards europe .
france 's return to nato 's military command structures in the coming year fits into that strategy .
it now depends on who will win the race to the white house and what level of importance the new administration will place on the alliance . an overly confident russian president vladimir putin has gained astonishing influence over nato during his last years of neo-nationalistic foreign policy .
the expansion to include ukraine and georgia was mainly delayed out of consideration for russian objections - something the denials by germany 's chancellor can not cover up . a framework agreement with the us also secured the kremlin a right to have a say in the matter of strategic missile defense , which naturally does n't present a threat to russia .
but accusations by the us and eastern europe that nato is throwing itself at putin are exaggerated . the nato-russia council offered a big stage to the outgoing president to reiterate his old and unfounded allegation at an emotional press conference .
this is probably meant for the domestic audience in russia - nato diplomats merely shake their heads in disbelief at putin 's behavior . despite all verbal attacks , russia and nato cooperate on a practical level , such as a common missile defense on the battle field or the transport of supplies to afghanistan .
for the first time , nato also discussed the orderly withdrawal from afghanistan , where it has been since 2001 . long overdue guidelines for when the multinational assistance force will hand over to afghans were finally decided on .
in the short term , nato will have to send even more troops to afghanistan to get the security situation under control . the germans will be called upon in the fall at the latest .

while they failed to find a compromise , unscripted debates were already quite a novel thing , says dw 's bernd riegert . the big enlargement summit that nato 's leading power and many new eastern european members had wished for has fallen through .
germany and france thwarted us plans and candidates ukraine and georgia were sent back to the waiting room . the conflict between the us and western european countries was openly talked about at the summit .
that 's a new thing for nato , since usually decisions are already made beforehand and everything happens according to plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time , however , the outgoing american president was stymied in his almost missionary expansion zeal .
another unusual aspect of the meeting in bucharest was the fact that 25 nato countries were unable to get greece and macedonia to agree on a compromise in the bizarre twist over macedonia 's name .
that 's why only croatia and albania were invited to become members .
george w. bush , the lame duck , did n't manage to have his way against greece , either . the macedonian name controversy should be seen as an operational accident .
nothing has changed as far as nato 's fundamental readiness to welcome all balkan countries into the stabilizing community is concerned and that 's a good thing .
bosnia-herzegovina , montenegro and serbia were all given a clear perspective - what 's still unclear is how long it will take for all of them to sit at the table . the summit 's surprise was german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy 's newly revived close cooperation .
they obviously want to shift nato 's focus towards europe .
france 's return to nato 's military command structures in the coming year fits into that strategy .
it now depends on who will win the race to the white house and what level of importance the new administration will place on the alliance . an overly confident russian president vladimir putin has gained astonishing influence over nato during his last years of neo-nationalistic foreign policy .
the expansion to include ukraine and georgia was mainly delayed out of consideration for russian objections - something the denials by germany 's chancellor can not cover up . a framework agreement with the us also secured the kremlin a right to have a say in the matter of strategic missile defense , which naturally does n't present a threat to russia .
but accusations by the us and eastern europe that nato is throwing itself at putin are exaggerated . the nato-russia council offered a big stage to the outgoing president to reiterate his old and unfounded allegation at an emotional press conference .
this is probably meant for the domestic audience in russia - nato diplomats merely shake their heads in disbelief at putin 's behavior . despite all verbal attacks , russia and nato cooperate on a practical level , such as a common missile defense on the battle field or the transport of supplies to afghanistan .
for the first time , nato also discussed the orderly withdrawal from afghanistan , where it has been since 2001 . long overdue guidelines for when the multinational assistance force will hand over to afghans were finally decided on .

" we have signed a memorandum of understanding on financial stability and cooperation in order to ensure stability , " said slovenian finance minister andrej bajuk after chairing a meeting with eu finance ministers and central bankers in the city of brdo .
under the agreement , public bailouts would be sought only if an institution 's troubles threatened the broader economy and there there were no private sector solution , according to the agreement .
" the use of public money to resolve a crisis can never be taken for granted and will only be considered to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy , " the document says .
" the management of an ailing institution will be held accountable , shareholders will not be bailed out and creditors and uninsured depositors should expect to face losses , " it says .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet said that european central banks ' assistance to troubled institutions was limited to situations " where there is a liquidity problem and not a solvency problem . "
minister cautions against " hysteria " arriving in the town of brdo to meet with his colleagues on friday , april 4 , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said that there was no point in getting too worked up over the current problems . " it 's going to keep us busy throughout 2008 , but i advise against getting hysterical about it , " steinbrueck told reporters . along with a record-strong euro , the bloc is also faced with sky-high inflation , which rose to 3.5 percent in march , the highest level since the euro zone was formed in 1999 . while saying that the situation was likely to get even worse , luxembourg 's premier and finance minster jean-claude juncker also tried to look on the bright side .
he said that the international monetary fund 's decision to lower the euro zone 's growth forecast to 1.3 percent for 2008 was " too pessimistic . " but juncker , who also heads the group of euro zone finance ministers , said that he did expect the eu commission to also lower its forecast from the current level of 1.8 percent . structural problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans keep getting less for more euros slovenia 's finance minister , andrej bajuk , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , meanwhile said that there definitely was concern about the current inflation within the bloc . " the changes that we are now seeing seem every day more of a structural nature than just a question of short-term development , " he said . jean-claude trichet has said that employers , including governments , should keep wage hikes moderate to avoid further inflation , according to ap news service . is ecb the problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the ecb partially to blame ?
the head of the imf , dominique strauss-kahn , on the other hand said that believes the real problem of the euro , as well as being overvalued , is the all powerful position of the european central bank . in monday 's edition of le monde , strauss-kahn said " the problem of the euro is that the european central bank , which has worked well to contain inflation , is all powerful . " " there is no counterweight in the shape of a real european finance minister who would be tasked with ensuring growth , " he told the newspaper . there have been persistent calls , especially in france , for the ecb to cut interest rates to bolster a slowing economy , but the bank has insisted that inflation remains the main threat and lending costs must remain high as a result . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german minister says subprime effects could extend into 2009 finance minister peer steinbrueck believes the impact of the global financial crisis could be felt well into next year .

" we have signed a memorandum of understanding on financial stability and cooperation in order to ensure stability , " said slovenian finance minister andrej bajuk after chairing a meeting with eu finance ministers and central bankers in the city of brdo .
under the agreement , public bailouts would be sought only if an institution 's troubles threatened the broader economy and there there were no private sector solution , according to the agreement .
" the use of public money to resolve a crisis can never be taken for granted and will only be considered to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy , " the document says .
" the management of an ailing institution will be held accountable , shareholders will not be bailed out and creditors and uninsured depositors should expect to face losses , " it says .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet said that european central banks ' assistance to troubled institutions was limited to situations " where there is a liquidity problem and not a solvency problem . "

germany is considered to be the current leader of europe and chancellor angela merkel the continent 's most influential politician , according to a six-nation poll published friday , april 4 .
only the us begs to differ . citizens in the five eu nations surveyed see germany as leader of the bloc , including 57 percent of spaniards and germans , 39 percent of italians and 35 percent of britons , according to the harris interactive poll published by france 24 television and the international herald tribune .
the poll of 6,478 people was conducted online between feb .
27 and march 6 . merkel came out well ahead of president nicolas " bling-bling " sarkozy as europe 's most influential personality - even in france where 38 percent cite the german leader against 18 percent their own president . although sarkozy is doing his best to seize the reins in europe , 68 percent of respondents in france still believe berlin is calling the shots in brussels - and germany is also seen as the country likely to have the most influence on the rest of europe over the next decade . trans-atlantic differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown -lrb- l -rrb- and bush - still close in the united states , meanwhile , perceptions are altogether different , with the much-touted " special relationship " between washington and london still very much in evidence . across the atlantic , a clear majority of 63 percent of americans believe britain to be the current leader of europe , a view shared by 33 percent of britons and 34 percent of italians . us respondents also believed british prime minister gordon brown to have most influence in europe at 23 percent , while sarkozy lags a long way behind with 9 percent and merkel with 8 percent . a potential ms. europe but back in europe , merkel ca n't be topped .
although most british and americans say they would choose former british prime minister tony blair as a potential president of europe , on the continent it is merkel who gets the popular vote , making her the only serving leader to be considered appropriate . the question has particular resonance with the prospect of an election for a newly empowered presidency of the european council looming on the horizon .
according to the lisbon treaty , eu leaders would , in future , choose a president for a 30-month term rather than the current six-month , rotating presidency system . earlier this week , even a high-ranking eu official suggested that merkel would be an ideal candidate to sit at the head of the eu table . " there are few women in the running when it comes to the eu 's top jobs , " said european communications commissioner margot wallstrom , pointing to merkel as a highly capable woman more than eligible for such a post . old europe gathering strength ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing ranks the six-nation poll was published the same week of the nato summit taking place in bucharest , which saw merkel and her sarkozy challenge us president george w. bush over the question of nato 's eastwards expansion , making it clear that berlin firmly opposed nato membership for georgia and ukraine in the short term . bush was forced to abandon his hopes for the two countries , while merkel , together with sarkozy , demonstrated that when germany and france close ranks they have considerable clout . on thursday , the french and german leaders , also announced that their nations would be jointly hosting the alliance 's 60th anniversary summit next year in the eastern french city of strasbourg and its german sister town of kehl , just across the rhine river . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is considered to be the current leader of europe and chancellor angela merkel the continent 's most influential politician , according to a six-nation poll published friday , april 4 .
only the us begs to differ . citizens in the five eu nations surveyed see germany as leader of the bloc , including 57 percent of spaniards and germans , 39 percent of italians and 35 percent of britons , according to the harris interactive poll published by france 24 television and the international herald tribune .
the poll of 6,478 people was conducted online between feb .
27 and march 6 . merkel came out well ahead of president nicolas " bling-bling " sarkozy as europe 's most influential personality - even in france where 38 percent cite the german leader against 18 percent their own president . although sarkozy is doing his best to seize the reins in europe , 68 percent of respondents in france still believe berlin is calling the shots in brussels - and germany is also seen as the country likely to have the most influence on the rest of europe over the next decade . trans-atlantic differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown -lrb- l -rrb- and bush - still close in the united states , meanwhile , perceptions are altogether different , with the much-touted " special relationship " between washington and london still very much in evidence . across the atlantic , a clear majority of 63 percent of americans believe britain to be the current leader of europe , a view shared by 33 percent of britons and 34 percent of italians . us respondents also believed british prime minister gordon brown to have most influence in europe at 23 percent , while sarkozy lags a long way behind with 9 percent and merkel with 8 percent . a potential ms. europe but back in europe , merkel ca n't be topped .
although most british and americans say they would choose former british prime minister tony blair as a potential president of europe , on the continent it is merkel who gets the popular vote , making her the only serving leader to be considered appropriate . the question has particular resonance with the prospect of an election for a newly empowered presidency of the european council looming on the horizon .
according to the lisbon treaty , eu leaders would , in future , choose a president for a 30-month term rather than the current six-month , rotating presidency system . earlier this week , even a high-ranking eu official suggested that merkel would be an ideal candidate to sit at the head of the eu table . " there are few women in the running when it comes to the eu 's top jobs , " said european communications commissioner margot wallstrom , pointing to merkel as a highly capable woman more than eligible for such a post . old europe gathering strength ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing ranks the six-nation poll was published the same week of the nato summit taking place in bucharest , which saw merkel and her sarkozy challenge us president george w. bush over the question of nato 's eastwards expansion , making it clear that berlin firmly opposed nato membership for georgia and ukraine in the short term . bush was forced to abandon his hopes for the two countries , while merkel , together with sarkozy , demonstrated that when germany and france close ranks they have considerable clout . on thursday , the french and german leaders , also announced that their nations would be jointly hosting the alliance 's 60th anniversary summit next year in the eastern french city of strasbourg and its german sister town of kehl , just across the rhine river . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is considered to be the current leader of europe and chancellor angela merkel the continent 's most influential politician , according to a six-nation poll published friday , april 4 .
only the us begs to differ . citizens in the five eu nations surveyed see germany as leader of the bloc , including 57 percent of spaniards and germans , 39 percent of italians and 35 percent of britons , according to the harris interactive poll published by france 24 television and the international herald tribune .
the poll of 6,478 people was conducted online between feb .
27 and march 6 . merkel came out well ahead of president nicolas " bling-bling " sarkozy as europe 's most influential personality - even in france where 38 percent cite the german leader against 18 percent their own president . although sarkozy is doing his best to seize the reins in europe , 68 percent of respondents in france still believe berlin is calling the shots in brussels - and germany is also seen as the country likely to have the most influence on the rest of europe over the next decade . trans-atlantic differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown -lrb- l -rrb- and bush - still close in the united states , meanwhile , perceptions are altogether different , with the much-touted " special relationship " between washington and london still very much in evidence . across the atlantic , a clear majority of 63 percent of americans believe britain to be the current leader of europe , a view shared by 33 percent of britons and 34 percent of italians . us respondents also believed british prime minister gordon brown to have most influence in europe at 23 percent , while sarkozy lags a long way behind with 9 percent and merkel with 8 percent . a potential ms. europe but back in europe , merkel ca n't be topped .
although most british and americans say they would choose former british prime minister tony blair as a potential president of europe , on the continent it is merkel who gets the popular vote , making her the only serving leader to be considered appropriate . the question has particular resonance with the prospect of an election for a newly empowered presidency of the european council looming on the horizon .
according to the lisbon treaty , eu leaders would , in future , choose a president for a 30-month term rather than the current six-month , rotating presidency system . earlier this week , even a high-ranking eu official suggested that merkel would be an ideal candidate to sit at the head of the eu table . " there are few women in the running when it comes to the eu 's top jobs , " said european communications commissioner margot wallstrom , pointing to merkel as a highly capable woman more than eligible for such a post . old europe gathering strength ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing ranks the six-nation poll was published the same week of the nato summit taking place in bucharest , which saw merkel and her sarkozy challenge us president george w. bush over the question of nato 's eastwards expansion , making it clear that berlin firmly opposed nato membership for georgia and ukraine in the short term . bush was forced to abandon his hopes for the two countries , while merkel , together with sarkozy , demonstrated that when germany and france close ranks they have considerable clout . on thursday , the french and german leaders , also announced that their nations would be jointly hosting the alliance 's 60th anniversary summit next year in the eastern french city of strasbourg and its german sister town of kehl , just across the rhine river . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have signed a memorandum of understanding on financial stability and cooperation in order to ensure stability , " said slovenian finance minister andrej bajuk after chairing a meeting with eu finance ministers and central bankers in the city of brdo .
under the agreement , public bailouts would be sought only if an institution 's troubles threatened the broader economy and there there were no private sector solution , according to the agreement .
" the use of public money to resolve a crisis can never be taken for granted and will only be considered to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy , " the document says .
" the management of an ailing institution will be held accountable , shareholders will not be bailed out and creditors and uninsured depositors should expect to face losses , " it says .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet said that european central banks ' assistance to troubled institutions was limited to situations " where there is a liquidity problem and not a solvency problem . "
minister cautions against " hysteria " arriving in the town of brdo to meet with his colleagues on friday , april 4 , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said that there was no point in getting too worked up over the current problems . " it 's going to keep us busy throughout 2008 , but i advise against getting hysterical about it , " steinbrueck told reporters . along with a record-strong euro , the bloc is also faced with sky-high inflation , which rose to 3.5 percent in march , the highest level since the euro zone was formed in 1999 . while saying that the situation was likely to get even worse , luxembourg 's premier and finance minster jean-claude juncker also tried to look on the bright side .
he said that the international monetary fund 's decision to lower the euro zone 's growth forecast to 1.3 percent for 2008 was " too pessimistic . " but juncker , who also heads the group of euro zone finance ministers , said that he did expect the eu commission to also lower its forecast from the current level of 1.8 percent . structural problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans keep getting less for more euros slovenia 's finance minister , andrej bajuk , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , meanwhile said that there definitely was concern about the current inflation within the bloc . " the changes that we are now seeing seem every day more of a structural nature than just a question of short-term development , " he said . jean-claude trichet has said that employers , including governments , should keep wage hikes moderate to avoid further inflation , according to ap news service . is ecb the problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the ecb partially to blame ?
the head of the imf , dominique strauss-kahn , on the other hand said that believes the real problem of the euro , as well as being overvalued , is the all powerful position of the european central bank . in monday 's edition of le monde , strauss-kahn said " the problem of the euro is that the european central bank , which has worked well to contain inflation , is all powerful . " " there is no counterweight in the shape of a real european finance minister who would be tasked with ensuring growth , " he told the newspaper . there have been persistent calls , especially in france , for the ecb to cut interest rates to bolster a slowing economy , but the bank has insisted that inflation remains the main threat and lending costs must remain high as a result . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has stirred deep unease in some quarters . under the 10-year , 7.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- project , a consortium between the bundeswehr and private firms like siemens and ibm is upgrading non-military it and communications infrastructure .
the project involves some 140,000 pcs , 7,000 servers and 300,000 telephones .
the bundeswehr has used the private sector to a limited extent before - chiefly for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
project hercules , currently the largest initiative of its kind in europe , represents a giant leap in scale .
is germany going down the problematic path taken by the us of outsourcing massive sectors of the military to profit-conscious private enterprise ?
the consortium - called bwi information technologies - says no .
" using the private sector has advantages , " bwi chief executive officer peter blaschke said .
" the bundeswehr is dependent on annual parliamentary budgets and can only engage in short-term planning .
with project hercules , we can - for the first time - have a 10-year plan and be flexible with investments .
for example , we 've invested ahead in the first year to get the project off to a fast start .
in addition , we 're securing the know-how of experts over a number of years . "
but some german politicians are monitoring the initiative with an extremely critical eye .
" the privatization of bundeswehr tasks is the wrong way to go , " said paul schaefer , the defense spokesman for the opposition left party 's parliamentary group .
" the private sector can play a role , but the question is who is ultimately responsible for the decision-making , " schaefer added .
" ibm and siemens will want to recoup their money , and there no telling right now whether the project will actually yield savings .
the total price has already gone up from 6.6 to over 7 billion euros , and the whole thing was preceded by five years of costly negotiations . "

the bundeswehr itself is represented on the board of directors , and the consortium is open to audit by the military , the german defense ministry and the general accountants office .
that 's part of an attempt to avoid repeating mistakes made by the united states .
private military contractors employed by the pentagon have been accused in extreme cases - such as the 2004 torture scandal at the abu ghraib prison in iraq - being involved in human rights abuses .
there have also been allegations of companies over-charging , doing poor work and usurping whole military sectors .
" the bundeswehr has chosen a clever path , " blaschke said .
" this is not a normal business contract , but a mandate for the military to build up its own it company .
the main computer center will not end up at ibm , and the bundeswehr will not fall into the trap of not having the know-how to run its own equipment .
after 10 years , bwi will revert to 100 percent bundeswehr control - that 's specified by the contract . "
but contracts , some fear , can be broken .
" there 's definitely more supervisory administration in germany than in the us , " schaefer said .
" but the question of brain-drain remains .
will the know-how really return to or remain with the bundeswehr once the contract expires ? "
the challenge for the bundeswehr is how to utilize the flexibility and expertise of the private sector without making itself as dependent as the us army , which is sometimes unable to operate and maintain privately designed systems .

the industry is highly secretive , but some estimates put the number of private employees in iraq above that of all non-us foreign troops combined - essentially making business the second-largest force in that war-torn country .
especially in the fog of war , it can be difficult to distinguish clearly between military and non-military activities when it comes to private companies .
" in germany , we 're roughly where the us was in the late 1980s and early 1990s in that only civilian , non-military tasks are supposed to be outsourced , " schaefer said .

the move has stirred deep unease in some quarters . under the 10-year , 7.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- project , a consortium between the bundeswehr and private firms like siemens and ibm is upgrading non-military it and communications infrastructure .
the project involves some 140,000 pcs , 7,000 servers and 300,000 telephones .
the bundeswehr has used the private sector to a limited extent before - chiefly for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
project hercules , currently the largest initiative of its kind in europe , represents a giant leap in scale .
is germany going down the problematic path taken by the us of outsourcing massive sectors of the military to profit-conscious private enterprise ?
the consortium - called bwi information technologies - says no .
" using the private sector has advantages , " bwi chief executive officer peter blaschke said .
" the bundeswehr is dependent on annual parliamentary budgets and can only engage in short-term planning .
with project hercules , we can - for the first time - have a 10-year plan and be flexible with investments .
for example , we 've invested ahead in the first year to get the project off to a fast start .
in addition , we 're securing the know-how of experts over a number of years . "
but some german politicians are monitoring the initiative with an extremely critical eye .
" the privatization of bundeswehr tasks is the wrong way to go , " said paul schaefer , the defense spokesman for the opposition left party 's parliamentary group .
" the private sector can play a role , but the question is who is ultimately responsible for the decision-making , " schaefer added .
" ibm and siemens will want to recoup their money , and there no telling right now whether the project will actually yield savings .
the total price has already gone up from 6.6 to over 7 billion euros , and the whole thing was preceded by five years of costly negotiations . "
lessons from the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bwi 's peter blaschke says project hercules has built-in safeguards project hercules distinguished between " green " -lrb- military -rrb- and " white " -lrb- non-military -rrb- information technology , with bwi only responsible for the latter .
the bundeswehr itself is represented on the board of directors , and the consortium is open to audit by the military , the german defense ministry and the general accountants office .
that 's part of an attempt to avoid repeating mistakes made by the united states .
private military contractors employed by the pentagon have been accused in extreme cases - such as the 2004 torture scandal at the abu ghraib prison in iraq - being involved in human rights abuses .
there have also been allegations of companies over-charging , doing poor work and usurping whole military sectors .
" the bundeswehr has chosen a clever path , " blaschke said .
" this is not a normal business contract , but a mandate for the military to build up its own it company .
the main computer center will not end up at ibm , and the bundeswehr will not fall into the trap of not having the know-how to run its own equipment .
after 10 years , bwi will revert to 100 percent bundeswehr control - that 's specified by the contract . "
but contracts , some fear , can be broken .
" there 's definitely more supervisory administration in germany than in the us , " schaefer said .
" but the question of brain-drain remains .
will the know-how really return to or remain with the bundeswehr once the contract expires ? "
the challenge for the bundeswehr is how to utilize the flexibility and expertise of the private sector without making itself as dependent as the us army , which is sometimes unable to operate and maintain privately designed systems .
the line between green and white bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blackwater employees have been active in combat in iraq the us military is thoroughly entwined with military service providers , which include not just blackwater and halliburton but lesser-known companies like caci or dyncorp .
the industry is highly secretive , but some estimates put the number of private employees in iraq above that of all non-us foreign troops combined - essentially making business the second-largest force in that war-torn country .
especially in the fog of war , it can be difficult to distinguish clearly between military and non-military activities when it comes to private companies .
" in germany , we 're roughly where the us was in the late 1980s and early 1990s in that only civilian , non-military tasks are supposed to be outsourced , " schaefer said .
" but the vehicle maintenance company has already been in bosnia .
and it may probably be just a matter of time until logistics specialists become active in afghanistan as well . "
bwi acknowledges the difficulties of drawing absolute lines between civilian , domestic tasks and foreign , military ones .
but it says there are safeguards .
" bwi will not be active abroad with the bundeswehr , and we 're not involved in things like weapons-guidance systems or it for military command centers , " blaschke said .
" and in a crisis situation , where the lines get blurred , the bundeswehr can assume total responsibility for all areas .
that 's part of the agreement . "
bwi said project hercules has gotten off to an optimal start .

but speculation in his native germany is mounting that he will return for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall in 2009 . during a private audience on thursday , april 3 , dieter althaus , the premier of german state thuringia , invited the pope to return to his home country .
though althaus ' spokesman said the pontiff was " basically open " to the idea , the head of the catholic church has yet to make an official decision . a tour of the former east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trip to erfurt would likely include mass at the cathedral of mary still , the mass-circulation tabloid bild reported friday that the journey would occur in mid-april 2009 .
the anticipated trip would combine celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the 60th anniversary of the passage of germany 's democratic constitution . it would also likely be limited to the cities of berlin and erfurt , thuringia 's capital .
in the heart of the communist former east germany , thuringia is the center of the cult of st. elizabeth of hungary -lrb- 1207-1231 -rrb- , who was born to a royal family and dedicated her life for the poor and sick . erfurt is also a place where catholics are few .
a visit there may be seen as a political move among germans , one-third of whom describe themselves as catholic .
althaus , however , said he would like the visit to focus on the role of the church in a globalized world and the position of the family in society . speculation about a fresh visit first peaked in february .
catholic church figures have asked benedict to visit , but the diocese of erfurt said thursday there was no official confirmation that the pope had accepted those invitations . a rare visit visits abroad by the 80-year-old pope are rare .
he has only three trips outside of italy scheduled for this year , including a much-publicized tour to the united states in mid-april .

but speculation in his native germany is mounting that he will return for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall in 2009 . during a private audience on thursday , april 3 , dieter althaus , the premier of german state thuringia , invited the pope to return to his home country .
though althaus ' spokesman said the pontiff was " basically open " to the idea , the head of the catholic church has yet to make an official decision . a tour of the former east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trip to erfurt would likely include mass at the cathedral of mary still , the mass-circulation tabloid bild reported friday that the journey would occur in mid-april 2009 .
the anticipated trip would combine celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the 60th anniversary of the passage of germany 's democratic constitution . it would also likely be limited to the cities of berlin and erfurt , thuringia 's capital .
in the heart of the communist former east germany , thuringia is the center of the cult of st. elizabeth of hungary -lrb- 1207-1231 -rrb- , who was born to a royal family and dedicated her life for the poor and sick . erfurt is also a place where catholics are few .
a visit there may be seen as a political move among germans , one-third of whom describe themselves as catholic .
althaus , however , said he would like the visit to focus on the role of the church in a globalized world and the position of the family in society . speculation about a fresh visit first peaked in february .
catholic church figures have asked benedict to visit , but the diocese of erfurt said thursday there was no official confirmation that the pope had accepted those invitations . a rare visit visits abroad by the 80-year-old pope are rare .
he has only three trips outside of italy scheduled for this year , including a much-publicized tour to the united states in mid-april .

but speculation in his native germany is mounting that he will return for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall in 2009 . during a private audience on thursday , april 3 , dieter althaus , the premier of german state thuringia , invited the pope to return to his home country .
though althaus ' spokesman said the pontiff was " basically open " to the idea , the head of the catholic church has yet to make an official decision . a tour of the former east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trip to erfurt would likely include mass at the cathedral of mary still , the mass-circulation tabloid bild reported friday that the journey would occur in mid-april 2009 .
the anticipated trip would combine celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the 60th anniversary of the passage of germany 's democratic constitution . it would also likely be limited to the cities of berlin and erfurt , thuringia 's capital .
in the heart of the communist former east germany , thuringia is the center of the cult of st. elizabeth of hungary -lrb- 1207-1231 -rrb- , who was born to a royal family and dedicated her life for the poor and sick . erfurt is also a place where catholics are few .
a visit there may be seen as a political move among germans , one-third of whom describe themselves as catholic .
althaus , however , said he would like the visit to focus on the role of the church in a globalized world and the position of the family in society . speculation about a fresh visit first peaked in february .
catholic church figures have asked benedict to visit , but the diocese of erfurt said thursday there was no official confirmation that the pope had accepted those invitations . a rare visit visits abroad by the 80-year-old pope are rare .
he has only three trips outside of italy scheduled for this year , including a much-publicized tour to the united states in mid-april .
during that trip , the former german cardinal joseph ratzinger will be touring a synagogue before the jewish high holiday of passover , a move intended to show good will to the jewish people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff was in cologne for world youth day in 2005 pope benedict xvi sparked controversy recently when he approved a revised version of a good friday mass in latin that includes a line asking god to help jews " acknowledge jesus christ as the savior . " a return to germany would mark the third visit for the pontiff since he ascended in 2005 .
his visit to cologne in 2005 as part of world youth day , a catholic youth convention , was received by a crowd of nearly 1 million - a record in the convention 's 20-year history . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is considered to be the current leader of europe and chancellor angela merkel the continent 's most influential politician , according to a six-nation poll published friday , april 4 .
only the us begs to differ . citizens in the five eu nations surveyed see germany as leader of the bloc , including 57 percent of spaniards and germans , 39 percent of italians and 35 percent of britons , according to the harris interactive poll published by france 24 television and the international herald tribune .
the poll of 6,478 people was conducted online between feb .
27 and march 6 . merkel came out well ahead of president nicolas " bling-bling " sarkozy as europe 's most influential personality - even in france where 38 percent cite the german leader against 18 percent their own president . although sarkozy is doing his best to seize the reins in europe , 68 percent of respondents in france still believe berlin is calling the shots in brussels - and germany is also seen as the country likely to have the most influence on the rest of europe over the next decade . trans-atlantic differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown -lrb- l -rrb- and bush - still close in the united states , meanwhile , perceptions are altogether different , with the much-touted " special relationship " between washington and london still very much in evidence . across the atlantic , a clear majority of 63 percent of americans believe britain to be the current leader of europe , a view shared by 33 percent of britons and 34 percent of italians . us respondents also believed british prime minister gordon brown to have most influence in europe at 23 percent , while sarkozy lags a long way behind with 9 percent and merkel with 8 percent . a potential ms. europe but back in europe , merkel ca n't be topped .
although most british and americans say they would choose former british prime minister tony blair as a potential president of europe , on the continent it is merkel who gets the popular vote , making her the only serving leader to be considered appropriate . the question has particular resonance with the prospect of an election for a newly empowered presidency of the european council looming on the horizon .
according to the lisbon treaty , eu leaders would , in future , choose a president for a 30-month term rather than the current six-month , rotating presidency system . earlier this week , even a high-ranking eu official suggested that merkel would be an ideal candidate to sit at the head of the eu table . " there are few women in the running when it comes to the eu 's top jobs , " said european communications commissioner margot wallstrom , pointing to merkel as a highly capable woman more than eligible for such a post . old europe gathering strength ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing ranks the six-nation poll was published the same week of the nato summit taking place in bucharest , which saw merkel and her sarkozy challenge us president george w. bush over the question of nato 's eastwards expansion , making it clear that berlin firmly opposed nato membership for georgia and ukraine in the short term . bush was forced to abandon his hopes for the two countries , while merkel , together with sarkozy , demonstrated that when germany and france close ranks they have considerable clout . on thursday , the french and german leaders , also announced that their nations would be jointly hosting the alliance 's 60th anniversary summit next year in the eastern french city of strasbourg and its german sister town of kehl , just across the rhine river . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is considered to be the current leader of europe and chancellor angela merkel the continent 's most influential politician , according to a six-nation poll published friday , april 4 .
only the us begs to differ . citizens in the five eu nations surveyed see germany as leader of the bloc , including 57 percent of spaniards and germans , 39 percent of italians and 35 percent of britons , according to the harris interactive poll published by france 24 television and the international herald tribune .
the poll of 6,478 people was conducted online between feb .
27 and march 6 . merkel came out well ahead of president nicolas " bling-bling " sarkozy as europe 's most influential personality - even in france where 38 percent cite the german leader against 18 percent their own president . although sarkozy is doing his best to seize the reins in europe , 68 percent of respondents in france still believe berlin is calling the shots in brussels - and germany is also seen as the country likely to have the most influence on the rest of europe over the next decade . trans-atlantic differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown -lrb- l -rrb- and bush - still close in the united states , meanwhile , perceptions are altogether different , with the much-touted " special relationship " between washington and london still very much in evidence . across the atlantic , a clear majority of 63 percent of americans believe britain to be the current leader of europe , a view shared by 33 percent of britons and 34 percent of italians . us respondents also believed british prime minister gordon brown to have most influence in europe at 23 percent , while sarkozy lags a long way behind with 9 percent and merkel with 8 percent . a potential ms. europe but back in europe , merkel ca n't be topped .
although most british and americans say they would choose former british prime minister tony blair as a potential president of europe , on the continent it is merkel who gets the popular vote , making her the only serving leader to be considered appropriate . the question has particular resonance with the prospect of an election for a newly empowered presidency of the european council looming on the horizon .
according to the lisbon treaty , eu leaders would , in future , choose a president for a 30-month term rather than the current six-month , rotating presidency system . earlier this week , even a high-ranking eu official suggested that merkel would be an ideal candidate to sit at the head of the eu table . " there are few women in the running when it comes to the eu 's top jobs , " said european communications commissioner margot wallstrom , pointing to merkel as a highly capable woman more than eligible for such a post . old europe gathering strength ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing ranks the six-nation poll was published the same week of the nato summit taking place in bucharest , which saw merkel and her sarkozy challenge us president george w. bush over the question of nato 's eastwards expansion , making it clear that berlin firmly opposed nato membership for georgia and ukraine in the short term . bush was forced to abandon his hopes for the two countries , while merkel , together with sarkozy , demonstrated that when germany and france close ranks they have considerable clout . on thursday , the french and german leaders , also announced that their nations would be jointly hosting the alliance 's 60th anniversary summit next year in the eastern french city of strasbourg and its german sister town of kehl , just across the rhine river . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 04.04.2008 german army 's it project raises military privatization issues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project is supposed to free soldiers for their core tasks this year , the german army kickstarts project hercules , a billion-euro initiative transferring non-military computer services to a public-private partnership .
the move has stirred deep unease in some quarters . under the 10-year , 7.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- project , a consortium between the bundeswehr and private firms like siemens and ibm is upgrading non-military it and communications infrastructure .
the project involves some 140,000 pcs , 7,000 servers and 300,000 telephones .
the bundeswehr has used the private sector to a limited extent before - chiefly for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
project hercules , currently the largest initiative of its kind in europe , represents a giant leap in scale .
is germany going down the problematic path taken by the us of outsourcing massive sectors of the military to profit-conscious private enterprise ?
the consortium - called bwi information technologies - says no .
" using the private sector has advantages , " bwi chief executive officer peter blaschke said .
" the bundeswehr is dependent on annual parliamentary budgets and can only engage in short-term planning .
with project hercules , we can - for the first time - have a 10-year plan and be flexible with investments .
for example , we 've invested ahead in the first year to get the project off to a fast start .
in addition , we 're securing the know-how of experts over a number of years . "
but some german politicians are monitoring the initiative with an extremely critical eye .
" the privatization of bundeswehr tasks is the wrong way to go , " said paul schaefer , the defense spokesman for the opposition left party 's parliamentary group .
" the private sector can play a role , but the question is who is ultimately responsible for the decision-making , " schaefer added .
" ibm and siemens will want to recoup their money , and there no telling right now whether the project will actually yield savings .
the total price has already gone up from 6.6 to over 7 billion euros , and the whole thing was preceded by five years of costly negotiations . "
lessons from the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bwi 's peter blaschke says project hercules has built-in safeguards project hercules distinguished between " green " -lrb- military -rrb- and " white " -lrb- non-military -rrb- information technology , with bwi only responsible for the latter .
the bundeswehr itself is represented on the board of directors , and the consortium is open to audit by the military , the german defense ministry and the general accountants office .
that 's part of an attempt to avoid repeating mistakes made by the united states .
private military contractors employed by the pentagon have been accused in extreme cases - such as the 2004 torture scandal at the abu ghraib prison in iraq - being involved in human rights abuses .
there have also been allegations of companies over-charging , doing poor work and usurping whole military sectors .
" the bundeswehr has chosen a clever path , " blaschke said .
" this is not a normal business contract , but a mandate for the military to build up its own it company .
the main computer center will not end up at ibm , and the bundeswehr will not fall into the trap of not having the know-how to run its own equipment .
after 10 years , bwi will revert to 100 percent bundeswehr control - that 's specified by the contract . "
but contracts , some fear , can be broken .
" there 's definitely more supervisory administration in germany than in the us , " schaefer said .
" but the question of brain-drain remains .
will the know-how really return to or remain with the bundeswehr once the contract expires ? "
the challenge for the bundeswehr is how to utilize the flexibility and expertise of the private sector without making itself as dependent as the us army , which is sometimes unable to operate and maintain privately designed systems .
the line between green and white bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blackwater employees have been active in combat in iraq the us military is thoroughly entwined with military service providers , which include not just blackwater and halliburton but lesser-known companies like caci or dyncorp .
the industry is highly secretive , but some estimates put the number of private employees in iraq above that of all non-us foreign troops combined - essentially making business the second-largest force in that war-torn country .
especially in the fog of war , it can be difficult to distinguish clearly between military and non-military activities when it comes to private companies .
" in germany , we 're roughly where the us was in the late 1980s and early 1990s in that only civilian , non-military tasks are supposed to be outsourced , " schaefer said .
" but the vehicle maintenance company has already been in bosnia .
and it may probably be just a matter of time until logistics specialists become active in afghanistan as well . "
bwi acknowledges the difficulties of drawing absolute lines between civilian , domestic tasks and foreign , military ones .
but it says there are safeguards .
" bwi will not be active abroad with the bundeswehr , and we 're not involved in things like weapons-guidance systems or it for military command centers , " blaschke said .
" and in a crisis situation , where the lines get blurred , the bundeswehr can assume total responsibility for all areas .
that 's part of the agreement . "
bwi said project hercules has gotten off to an optimal start .
but it will be years down the road before its efficiency can be determined - and the question answered as to whether the bundeswehr has succeeded in maintaining the crucial distinction between civilian and military tasks . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has stirred deep unease in some quarters . under the 10-year , 7.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- project , a consortium between the bundeswehr and private firms like siemens and ibm is upgrading non-military it and communications infrastructure .
the project involves some 140,000 pcs , 7,000 servers and 300,000 telephones .
the bundeswehr has used the private sector to a limited extent before - chiefly for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
project hercules , currently the largest initiative of its kind in europe , represents a giant leap in scale .
is germany going down the problematic path taken by the us of outsourcing massive sectors of the military to profit-conscious private enterprise ?
the consortium - called bwi information technologies - says no .
" using the private sector has advantages , " bwi chief executive officer peter blaschke said .
" the bundeswehr is dependent on annual parliamentary budgets and can only engage in short-term planning .
with project hercules , we can - for the first time - have a 10-year plan and be flexible with investments .
for example , we 've invested ahead in the first year to get the project off to a fast start .
in addition , we 're securing the know-how of experts over a number of years . "
but some german politicians are monitoring the initiative with an extremely critical eye .
" the privatization of bundeswehr tasks is the wrong way to go , " said paul schaefer , the defense spokesman for the opposition left party 's parliamentary group .
" the private sector can play a role , but the question is who is ultimately responsible for the decision-making , " schaefer added .
" ibm and siemens will want to recoup their money , and there no telling right now whether the project will actually yield savings .
the total price has already gone up from 6.6 to over 7 billion euros , and the whole thing was preceded by five years of costly negotiations . "

the bundeswehr itself is represented on the board of directors , and the consortium is open to audit by the military , the german defense ministry and the general accountants office .
that 's part of an attempt to avoid repeating mistakes made by the united states .
private military contractors employed by the pentagon have been accused in extreme cases - such as the 2004 torture scandal at the abu ghraib prison in iraq - being involved in human rights abuses .
there have also been allegations of companies over-charging , doing poor work and usurping whole military sectors .
" the bundeswehr has chosen a clever path , " blaschke said .
" this is not a normal business contract , but a mandate for the military to build up its own it company .
the main computer center will not end up at ibm , and the bundeswehr will not fall into the trap of not having the know-how to run its own equipment .
after 10 years , bwi will revert to 100 percent bundeswehr control - that 's specified by the contract . "
but contracts , some fear , can be broken .
" there 's definitely more supervisory administration in germany than in the us , " schaefer said .
" but the question of brain-drain remains .
will the know-how really return to or remain with the bundeswehr once the contract expires ? "
the challenge for the bundeswehr is how to utilize the flexibility and expertise of the private sector without making itself as dependent as the us army , which is sometimes unable to operate and maintain privately designed systems .
the line between green and white bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blackwater employees have been active in combat in iraq the us military is thoroughly entwined with military service providers , which include not just blackwater and halliburton but lesser-known companies like caci or dyncorp .
the industry is highly secretive , but some estimates put the number of private employees in iraq above that of all non-us foreign troops combined - essentially making business the second-largest force in that war-torn country .
especially in the fog of war , it can be difficult to distinguish clearly between military and non-military activities when it comes to private companies .
" in germany , we 're roughly where the us was in the late 1980s and early 1990s in that only civilian , non-military tasks are supposed to be outsourced , " schaefer said .
" but the vehicle maintenance company has already been in bosnia .
and it may probably be just a matter of time until logistics specialists become active in afghanistan as well . "

that 's part of the agreement . "

the move has stirred deep unease in some quarters . under the 10-year , 7.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- project , a consortium between the bundeswehr and private firms like siemens and ibm is upgrading non-military it and communications infrastructure .
the project involves some 140,000 pcs , 7,000 servers and 300,000 telephones .
the bundeswehr has used the private sector to a limited extent before - chiefly for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
project hercules , currently the largest initiative of its kind in europe , represents a giant leap in scale .
is germany going down the problematic path taken by the us of outsourcing massive sectors of the military to profit-conscious private enterprise ?
the consortium - called bwi information technologies - says no .
" using the private sector has advantages , " bwi chief executive officer peter blaschke said .
" the bundeswehr is dependent on annual parliamentary budgets and can only engage in short-term planning .
with project hercules , we can - for the first time - have a 10-year plan and be flexible with investments .
for example , we 've invested ahead in the first year to get the project off to a fast start .
in addition , we 're securing the know-how of experts over a number of years . "
but some german politicians are monitoring the initiative with an extremely critical eye .
" the privatization of bundeswehr tasks is the wrong way to go , " said paul schaefer , the defense spokesman for the opposition left party 's parliamentary group .
" the private sector can play a role , but the question is who is ultimately responsible for the decision-making , " schaefer added .
" ibm and siemens will want to recoup their money , and there no telling right now whether the project will actually yield savings .
the total price has already gone up from 6.6 to over 7 billion euros , and the whole thing was preceded by five years of costly negotiations . "
lessons from the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bwi 's peter blaschke says project hercules has built-in safeguards project hercules distinguished between " green " -lrb- military -rrb- and " white " -lrb- non-military -rrb- information technology , with bwi only responsible for the latter .
the bundeswehr itself is represented on the board of directors , and the consortium is open to audit by the military , the german defense ministry and the general accountants office .
that 's part of an attempt to avoid repeating mistakes made by the united states .
private military contractors employed by the pentagon have been accused in extreme cases - such as the 2004 torture scandal at the abu ghraib prison in iraq - being involved in human rights abuses .
there have also been allegations of companies over-charging , doing poor work and usurping whole military sectors .
" the bundeswehr has chosen a clever path , " blaschke said .
" this is not a normal business contract , but a mandate for the military to build up its own it company .
the main computer center will not end up at ibm , and the bundeswehr will not fall into the trap of not having the know-how to run its own equipment .
after 10 years , bwi will revert to 100 percent bundeswehr control - that 's specified by the contract . "
but contracts , some fear , can be broken .
" there 's definitely more supervisory administration in germany than in the us , " schaefer said .
" but the question of brain-drain remains .
will the know-how really return to or remain with the bundeswehr once the contract expires ? "
the challenge for the bundeswehr is how to utilize the flexibility and expertise of the private sector without making itself as dependent as the us army , which is sometimes unable to operate and maintain privately designed systems .

the move has stirred deep unease in some quarters . under the 10-year , 7.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- project , a consortium between the bundeswehr and private firms like siemens and ibm is upgrading non-military it and communications infrastructure .
the project involves some 140,000 pcs , 7,000 servers and 300,000 telephones .
the bundeswehr has used the private sector to a limited extent before - chiefly for clothing , catering and vehicle-maintenance services .
project hercules , currently the largest initiative of its kind in europe , represents a giant leap in scale .
is germany going down the problematic path taken by the us of outsourcing massive sectors of the military to profit-conscious private enterprise ?
the consortium - called bwi information technologies - says no .
" using the private sector has advantages , " bwi chief executive officer peter blaschke said .
" the bundeswehr is dependent on annual parliamentary budgets and can only engage in short-term planning .
with project hercules , we can - for the first time - have a 10-year plan and be flexible with investments .
for example , we 've invested ahead in the first year to get the project off to a fast start .
in addition , we 're securing the know-how of experts over a number of years . "
but some german politicians are monitoring the initiative with an extremely critical eye .
" the privatization of bundeswehr tasks is the wrong way to go , " said paul schaefer , the defense spokesman for the opposition left party 's parliamentary group .
" the private sector can play a role , but the question is who is ultimately responsible for the decision-making , " schaefer added .
" ibm and siemens will want to recoup their money , and there no telling right now whether the project will actually yield savings .
the total price has already gone up from 6.6 to over 7 billion euros , and the whole thing was preceded by five years of costly negotiations . "

the bundeswehr itself is represented on the board of directors , and the consortium is open to audit by the military , the german defense ministry and the general accountants office .
that 's part of an attempt to avoid repeating mistakes made by the united states .
private military contractors employed by the pentagon have been accused in extreme cases - such as the 2004 torture scandal at the abu ghraib prison in iraq - being involved in human rights abuses .
there have also been allegations of companies over-charging , doing poor work and usurping whole military sectors .
" the bundeswehr has chosen a clever path , " blaschke said .
" this is not a normal business contract , but a mandate for the military to build up its own it company .
the main computer center will not end up at ibm , and the bundeswehr will not fall into the trap of not having the know-how to run its own equipment .
after 10 years , bwi will revert to 100 percent bundeswehr control - that 's specified by the contract . "
but contracts , some fear , can be broken .
" there 's definitely more supervisory administration in germany than in the us , " schaefer said .
" but the question of brain-drain remains .
will the know-how really return to or remain with the bundeswehr once the contract expires ? "
the challenge for the bundeswehr is how to utilize the flexibility and expertise of the private sector without making itself as dependent as the us army , which is sometimes unable to operate and maintain privately designed systems .

the industry is highly secretive , but some estimates put the number of private employees in iraq above that of all non-us foreign troops combined - essentially making business the second-largest force in that war-torn country .
especially in the fog of war , it can be difficult to distinguish clearly between military and non-military activities when it comes to private companies .
" in germany , we 're roughly where the us was in the late 1980s and early 1990s in that only civilian , non-military tasks are supposed to be outsourced , " schaefer said .
" but the vehicle maintenance company has already been in bosnia .
and it may probably be just a matter of time until logistics specialists become active in afghanistan as well . "

environmental protection groups supported the move . " we will not do it , " gabriel , a social democrat , told the television channel ard on friday , april 4 .
" it is not a measure dealing with environmental policy , but a measure destined to aid the automobile industry . " the news dealt a blow to so-called green fuels , which have been seen as a way to reduce global warming by reducing carbon dioxide emissions . mixing plant-based ethanol with fossil gasoline can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide , one of several so-called greenhouse gases that exacerbate climate change . but ecologists have complained about the practice not least because a number of countries destroy tropical rain forests in order to cultivate the plants used to make biofuels . damaging older cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers would pay the price , had the plans gone ahead germany had initially hailed biofuel blending as a way of achieving reductions in greenhouse gases without imposing restrictions proposed by the eu , which could hit the country 's performance car industry . the german e10 project was supposed to ensure that 10 percent of petrol used by cars and light trucks in germany was comprised of ethanol by 2009 . the initiative formed the cornerstone of berlin 's ambitious climate change policy package laid out in 2007 , designed to cut emissions 40 percent by 2020 at a cost of 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- . but politicians and industry groups had criticized the plans to raise the level to 10 percent for some gasoline grades from 5 percent , saying that the increase would damage older cars because the biofuels were more corrosive than conventional petrol and threatened to wear out certain engine parts too quickly . meanwhile , otmar bernhard , environment minister in bavaria from the conservative csu party , called the blending plans " climate policy hot air . " passing the buck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old cars would be hardest hit gabriel said he would abandon the project if the number of vehicles that could not use the fuel surpassed 1 million . on friday he said the number had exceeded 3 million and that these cars were not ready for the new fuel and could be forced to switch to more expensive , unblended gasoline grades because of possible damage .
most of the cars in question are imported . the environment minister said he feared the change could hit lower earners who generally own older cars . " our environmental policy does not want to be responsible for driving millions of car drivers ... to expensive super plus petrol pumps , " he told the mass-circulation bild tabloid . gabriel blamed the car industry for the switch in policy , saying it had revised its figures . the german automakers association vda had said thursday that the number was much lower , at around 360,000 , and that the jump in affected automobile was due to imported cars . " the german automotive industry has done its homework and stuck to its word , " vda president matthias wissmann said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hu jia , 34 , was jailed for three and a half years on thursday for subversion .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice called it " deeply disturbing " , while uk counterpart david miliband said it was " a most concerning development " .
amnesty international called it " a warning " to chinese activists who raised human rights concerns publicly .
earlier this week , the rights group accused china of a " wave of repression " against activists and dissidents ahead of the beijing olympic games .
' irrational and unfair ' hu jia has become one of china 's most outspoken activists , tackling issues including religious and political freedom , hiv / aids and the environment .
he was detained late last year , after weeks of house arrest , and convicted on thursday of " inciting subversion of state power and the socialist system " .
his lawyer said that charges related to interviews he gave to foreign media and political articles that he wrote for the internet .
chinese state media said that mr hu has been treated " with leniency " because he had acknowledged wrongdoing .
foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said that his case had been handled " according to chinese laws " and urged people not to interfere in china 's internal affairs .
but hu jia 's sentence was swiftly condemned in other areas .
" there is no doubt that this is a decision that is deeply disturbing to us and we are communicating that to the chinese authorities , " ms rice said at a nato summit in bucharest .
louise arbour , the united nations high commissioner for human rights , expressed concern about cases including hu jia 's " in which it seems national security issues are being used as grounds to curtail social activism by human rights defenders " .
paris-based media watchdog reports without borders , meanwhile , said it was " appalled " .
the group urged european union leaders to freeze human rights dialogue with china and called on leaders to boycott the opening ceremony of the beijing games .
hu jia 's wife , zeng jinyan , is also a human rights activist .
she remains under house arrest but was allowed to attend the court hearing for the verdict .
she said that her husband 's imprisonment came after years of harassment .
" he 's been under surveillance , been kidnapped .
he 's been put under house arrest and now they have sentenced him to three and a half years , " she said .
" this is irrational and unfair . "
hu jia has 10 days in which to lodge an appeal against his sentence , but his lawyer said no decision on whether to do so had been made .

but new doubts have emerged that it will ever happen .
uniting turkey , a large mainly muslim nation , with the european union is europe 's biggest peace project since world war ii , turkey 's foreign minister ali babacan says .
but he complains that some eu countries are holding turkey back out of political ill-will .
turkey has had enough of being europe 's whipping boy .
after nine years of frustrating efforts as an official candidate to join the european union but still without a guarantee of membership in the end , its leaders now have a tougher message for europe - play fair , because you need us as much as we need you .
veiled warning mr babacan told bbc news " europe should never think that turkey has no choice " .
this did not mean there was any " other alliance or group of countries we might join forces with " , the minister explained .
but the relationship must be a two-way street , of benefit to both sides .
the ruling ak party 's agenda is under intense scrutiny the foreign minister 's veiled warning came this week during a conference in istanbul of the british wilton park organisation for politicians and policy-makers to assess turkey 's path towards eu accession .
last week turkey 's most ardent supporters of its european hopes were shocked when the prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan , told students in sarajevo that his country would have " nothing to lose " if europe kept it out .
the eu would be the loser , mr erdogan claimed .
turkey 's 45-year-old commitment to integration in europe has hit serious turbulence .
and " enlargement fatigue " among the eu 's 27 member states is not the main reason .
the issue is turkey itself .
turkish hopes are threatened by flagging popular support on both sides .
feeling unwanted a key eurobarometer opinion poll shows that 59 % of europeans oppose turkish membership , with only 28 % in favour .
the present leaders of germany and france both say turkey lacks the european and democratic credentials to take on eu membership .
among turks , too , support for eu accession has fallen sharply , from three-quarters of the population three years ago to half or even less today .
mr babacan says his people have been made to feel " unwanted " in europe .
both sides have a list of complaints .
the eu complains that turkey 's democratic reforms have slowed since 2005 when its membership talks began .
now the european commission is warning that a high-profile court case could damage turkey 's long-term european ambitions .
turkey 's constitutional court is to hear the chief prosecutor 's case for closing down the ruling ak party , over alleged breaches of turkey 's secular ideals .
the eu 's patience has been stretched to the limit over the turkish government 's delays in amending its notorious article 301 law , under which scores of journalists and writers have been prosecuted for the vague offence of " insulting turkishness " .
cyprus dispute since the end of 2006 turkey 's painstaking talks aimed at eu accession have been pushed into the slow lane to censure the country for its refusal to allow free trade in goods from a new eu member , cyprus .
efforts to reunite divided cyprus are gaining momentum turkey blames the eu for letting in cyprus before ending the island 's division between greek and turkish cypriots .
and turkey in turn accuses europe of not playing fair .
mr babacan says france 's president nicolas sarkozy tried to push turkey into accepting an alternative to eu membership by launching his plan for a " mediterranean union " of eu and neighbouring states .
that threat now seems to have eased , but the turks have not yet said if they will take part .
turkish officials object to the exceptional conditions placed in advance on the terms of their eventual membership - including the demand by current eu states to be allowed to place permanent restrictions on the movement of turks to work elsewhere in europe .
turkish leaders express bafflement that europe does not show more understanding for what they have already done .
turkey , they point , was a loyal member of nato even before the former west germany .
it is now europe 's sixth-largest economy , a major transit route for europe 's energy needs , and a serious regional power .
and at home the government 's own survival is under threat from nationalist judges and political foes .
but still , says mr babacan , some european leaders use populist rhetoric , exaggerating the risks of mass immigration and the turks ' muslim faith to stir up voters ' fear and win elections .
turkey also has its allies , including britain .
uk minister for europe jim murphy told the istanbul gathering that bringing turkey into the european union would dispel the " myths " about a clash of civilisations , and be the most important strategic decision the eu had ever made .
failure , he said , was unthinkable .
the eu as a whole still says turkey will not be ready to join until at least 2014 , if at all .
turkey 's foreign minister puts the question the other way round .
he asks : when will europe be ready for turkey ?

this did not mean there was any " other alliance or group of countries we might join forces with " , the minister explained .
but the relationship must be a two-way street , of benefit to both sides .
the ruling ak party 's agenda is under intense scrutiny the foreign minister 's veiled warning came this week during a conference in istanbul of the british wilton park organisation for politicians and policy-makers to assess turkey 's path towards eu accession .
last week turkey 's most ardent supporters of its european hopes were shocked when the prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan , told students in sarajevo that his country would have " nothing to lose " if europe kept it out .
the eu would be the loser , mr erdogan claimed .
turkey 's 45-year-old commitment to integration in europe has hit serious turbulence .
and " enlargement fatigue " among the eu 's 27 member states is not the main reason .
the issue is turkey itself .
turkish hopes are threatened by flagging popular support on both sides .
feeling unwanted a key eurobarometer opinion poll shows that 59 % of europeans oppose turkish membership , with only 28 % in favour .
the present leaders of germany and france both say turkey lacks the european and democratic credentials to take on eu membership .
among turks , too , support for eu accession has fallen sharply , from three-quarters of the population three years ago to half or even less today .
mr babacan says his people have been made to feel " unwanted " in europe .
both sides have a list of complaints .
the eu complains that turkey 's democratic reforms have slowed since 2005 when its membership talks began .
now the european commission is warning that a high-profile court case could damage turkey 's long-term european ambitions .
turkey 's constitutional court is to hear the chief prosecutor 's case for closing down the ruling ak party , over alleged breaches of turkey 's secular ideals .
the eu 's patience has been stretched to the limit over the turkish government 's delays in amending its notorious article 301 law , under which scores of journalists and writers have been prosecuted for the vague offence of " insulting turkishness " .
cyprus dispute since the end of 2006 turkey 's painstaking talks aimed at eu accession have been pushed into the slow lane to censure the country for its refusal to allow free trade in goods from a new eu member , cyprus .
efforts to reunite divided cyprus are gaining momentum turkey blames the eu for letting in cyprus before ending the island 's division between greek and turkish cypriots .
and turkey in turn accuses europe of not playing fair .
mr babacan says france 's president nicolas sarkozy tried to push turkey into accepting an alternative to eu membership by launching his plan for a " mediterranean union " of eu and neighbouring states .
that threat now seems to have eased , but the turks have not yet said if they will take part .
turkish officials object to the exceptional conditions placed in advance on the terms of their eventual membership - including the demand by current eu states to be allowed to place permanent restrictions on the movement of turks to work elsewhere in europe .
turkish leaders express bafflement that europe does not show more understanding for what they have already done .
turkey , they point , was a loyal member of nato even before the former west germany .
it is now europe 's sixth-largest economy , a major transit route for europe 's energy needs , and a serious regional power .
and at home the government 's own survival is under threat from nationalist judges and political foes .
but still , says mr babacan , some european leaders use populist rhetoric , exaggerating the risks of mass immigration and the turks ' muslim faith to stir up voters ' fear and win elections .
turkey also has its allies , including britain .
uk minister for europe jim murphy told the istanbul gathering that bringing turkey into the european union would dispel the " myths " about a clash of civilisations , and be the most important strategic decision the eu had ever made .
failure , he said , was unthinkable .
the eu as a whole still says turkey will not be ready to join until at least 2014 , if at all .
turkey 's foreign minister puts the question the other way round .
he asks : when will europe be ready for turkey ?

extra trains and coaches will travel on sunday to london for the club 's first game at wembley in 81 years .
but train operator first great western has warned that services will be very busy and warned supporters to buy tickets early to be sure of a place .
there was good news , however , for fans when a planned tube strike due to start on sunday evening was called off .
the exodus of cardiff fans from south wales is beginning for sunday 's game .
the bluebirds hope to progress to their first final since 1927 , when they beat arsenal to become the first welsh club to win the fa cup .
hundreds of coaches and minibuses will also join the convoy over the weekend .
first great western is running three extra trains to and from london paddington to help carry the thousands of supporters .
no alcohol the company said no alcohol will be allowed on board on any service between south wales and london or on the return journeys .
engineering work in the severn tunnel means journeys will be 45 minutes slower than usual .
it will mean trains will travel through gloucester and take between three and three-and-a-half hours to reach london .
network rail said the works , which it had been planning for 18 months , were essential .
from paddington , fans can take a direct london underground service to wembley central using the bakerloo line , or to wembley park station via baker street .
fears that a tube strike could disrupt fans ' travel plans have ended after a proposed strike was called off on thursday .
underground if industrial action had gone ahead from 1830 bst on sunday , it would have caused cardiff and barnsley fans particular problems as the game will kick off at 1600 bst .
bus and overland rail services should still be running as normal .
national express has two special coaches going directly to the stadium itself and hundreds of coaches and minibuses have been chartered by fans from across south wales .
gwyn davies from the valley rams supporters ' club said it had booked between 80 - 90 coaches .

advertisement evan davis talks about his first week on the today programme he gets up at three in the morning and has to think on his feet for three hours .
he has " crashed " the radio 4 pips and been subjected to intense media scrutiny .
but one week into his new job as presenter on bbc radio 4 's flagship today programme , evan davis is as enthusiastic as ever .
and any qualms about sharing studio space - and air time - with legendary figures like john humphrys and jim naughtie are quickly brushed aside .
" they are all lovely - they all know that i am a bit of a novice at this game , " he says , " i 'm used to the dragons in dragons ' den so my fellow presenters are all cuddly kittens by comparison . "
" they all have their idiosyncrasies , " he says , smiling with his trademark grin .
" john humphrys tends to ad lib quite a bit and come into the end of an interview with his own question .
jim naughtie is apparently famous for losing bits of paper " .
precocious kid evan davis started presenting bbc radio 4 's flagship morning news programme on tuesday .

john humphrys had to come in and rescue me because i had basically finished the programme five seconds early evan davis " it means quite a lot to be working on the today programme .
i was a rather precocious kid actually so i was listening to radio 4 when i was quite young .
it 's quite an institution and to be sitting there feels like a lot of responsibility . "

intense scrutiny the bbc 's former economics editor is surprised at how much attention his arrival has received .
he was shocked that the guardian wrote a continuous blog on his first day .
" at eight minutes past 6am there is someone commenting on a time check .
you are subject to a lot of scrutiny .
" it is much harder than it looks .
it is a very , very intense period of concentration - those three hours , " he says .
" there is a great deal of thinking on your feet so afterwards i have a sense of ' oh i should have done better , should have asked a more probing question , a better question , a funnier question ' .
i guess it is just one of those things you get used to . "
early to bed he does not mind the unusual sleep patterns which the programme - which airs from 6am to 9am on weekdays and from 7am to 9am on saturday - demands .
" the best tip my co-presenters gave me was to go to bed very early .
i go to bed at 8pm and get up at 3am .
the only problem is at 8pm you can lie in a darkened room for quite a while with nothing happening .
but generally the sleep thing is going fine " .
how evan will fare in his new role has received much speculation , particularly in the blogosphere .
" a lot of people have said this guy is not going to cut it because he 's not nasty enough , i hope i can be sufficiently nasty to keep the audience engaged .
i do n't want to be gratuitously nasty but i hope i have a little bit of nastiness in me , " he says .
" i tend to be accused of being a cheerful person , that is just who i am , i tend to see things rather optimistically , i tend to see the funny side of them and i find it hard to be driven down by the news .
i suppose if i do the job for long enough i might get a bit world weary but at the moment i am trying to be bountiful and enthusiastic . "

the grant is part of a funding programme which the government hopes will bring a renaissance in the fortunes of english seaside towns .
the cash will be spent on cultural and heritage projects , such as improving theatres and public gardens .
blackpool was chosen because of its high levels of social and economic deprivation , the government said .
culture secretary andy burnham said the aim of the project was to reinvigorate england 's coastal resorts .
" our seaside resorts are much loved and an integral part of english culture .
but some of them are looking a bit faded and no longer attract as many visitors as they did , " he said .
" many hold hidden treasures and this money provides a much needed boost to the resorts . "
' original flair ' so-called " sea change " projects will act as catalysts for further economic regeneration in the towns receiving the cash , the government said .
in february , it was announced that blackpool would get £ 300m of government money for regeneration as a consolation for missing out on the super-casino .
the new cash will be earmarked for projects to improve what has been called the resort 's " cultural infrastructure " .
it can be used to revamp historic public spaces such as promenades and gardens , or enhance buildings such as theatres , galleries , arts centres and concert halls .
blackpool council can put forward projects to the commission for architecture and the built environment -lrb- cabe -rrb- but must match funding costs to qualify for a grant for a specific project .
cabe chairman , sir john sorrell , said : " we want to see exciting and innovative projects which build on the strong identity these towns enjoy and give them the best opportunity to recapture their original flair . "

the grant is part of a funding programme which the government hopes will bring a renaissance in the fortunes of english seaside towns .
the cash will be spent on cultural and heritage projects , such as improving theatres and public gardens .
blackpool was chosen because of its high levels of social and economic deprivation , the government said .
culture secretary andy burnham said the aim of the project was to reinvigorate england 's coastal resorts .
" our seaside resorts are much loved and an integral part of english culture .
but some of them are looking a bit faded and no longer attract as many visitors as they did , " he said .
" many hold hidden treasures and this money provides a much needed boost to the resorts . "
' original flair ' so-called " sea change " projects will act as catalysts for further economic regeneration in the towns receiving the cash , the government said .
in february , it was announced that blackpool would get £ 300m of government money for regeneration as a consolation for missing out on the super-casino .
the new cash will be earmarked for projects to improve what has been called the resort 's " cultural infrastructure " .
it can be used to revamp historic public spaces such as promenades and gardens , or enhance buildings such as theatres , galleries , arts centres and concert halls .
blackpool council can put forward projects to the commission for architecture and the built environment -lrb- cabe -rrb- but must match funding costs to qualify for a grant for a specific project .
cabe chairman , sir john sorrell , said : " we want to see exciting and innovative projects which build on the strong identity these towns enjoy and give them the best opportunity to recapture their original flair . "

the dance musician , from dumfries , in the south of scotland , was returning to the uk from america when the bag containing his laptop went missing .
a spokeswoman for his record company confirmed it contained the only copy of work on harris 's second album .
" this is not good news for me , " he said on his website .
" i have been walking in circles for a couple of days . "
the dj and producer 's first release - i created disco - was a top 10 hit last year and carried the debut single acceptable in the 80s .
the album 's success led to him working with the likes of sophie ellis-bextor and kylie minogue , for whom he wrote the forthcoming single in my arms in his bedroom on a 15-year-old computer .
a spokeswoman for columbia records confirmed that the lost laptop contained several new songs the dj and musician had been working on . "
you ca n't really put a price on something like a new record " columbia records spokeswoman " he has lost the only copy of the new album , " she said .
" it is a big cause for concern - months of work have gone into that . "
she said it would not affect his live performances as they did not involve the use of the laptop .
however , it could set back work on a new album for some time .
" they have offered about £ 750 in compensation , " said the spokeswoman .
" you ca n't really put a price on something like a new record . "
flights cancelled british airways has said its priority is to reunite passengers with their luggage as soon as possible .
more than 400 volunteer staff have been working to deal with the situation .
thousands of bags were caught in a backlog after the opening of the new t5 terminal at heathrow this week .
numerous flights were cancelled due to problems with the baggage handling system .
british airways has admitted that the chaos surrounding the opening of terminal 5 has so far cost about £ 16 million .

they are unhappy with a 2 % pay increase offer and are due to be balloted on strike action , the union prospect said .
staff will also be consulted about action at two smaller sites in risley , warrington and capenhurst on the wiral .
managers at sellafield said they were prepared to negotiate further and are offering a new pay incentive scheme up to 2 % on top of the rise .

' brilliant job ' he said : " we want a fair pay offer but talks are currently at an impasse .
" i do n't want to criticise the management team at sellafield , they have done a brilliant job in difficult circumstances over the years , and i believe their hands have been tied by the government .
" we do n't want to have to take action , but sometimes you have no choice , but action will be the last thing we look at . "
a statement from sellafield management said : " the company offered an increase in salaries of 2 % and the opportunity to earn a further incentive bonus of up to 2 % of salary funded by efficiency improvements .
" we made it clear that we are prepared to negotiate further on the details of this incentive scheme .
" our offer is intended to help increase the efficiency of the business which is a necessary step towards securing our long-term future .

they are unhappy with a 2 % pay increase offer and are due to be balloted on strike action , the union prospect said .
staff will also be consulted about action at two smaller sites in risley , warrington and capenhurst on the wiral .
managers at sellafield said they were prepared to negotiate further and are offering a new pay incentive scheme up to 2 % on top of the rise .

" we do n't want to have to take action , but sometimes you have no choice , but action will be the last thing we look at . "
a statement from sellafield management said : " the company offered an increase in salaries of 2 % and the opportunity to earn a further incentive bonus of up to 2 % of salary funded by efficiency improvements .
" we made it clear that we are prepared to negotiate further on the details of this incentive scheme .

" i do n't want to criticise the management team at sellafield , they have done a brilliant job in difficult circumstances over the years , and i believe their hands have been tied by the government .
" we do n't want to have to take action , but sometimes you have no choice , but action will be the last thing we look at . "
a statement from sellafield management said : " the company offered an increase in salaries of 2 % and the opportunity to earn a further incentive bonus of up to 2 % of salary funded by efficiency improvements .
" we made it clear that we are prepared to negotiate further on the details of this incentive scheme .
" our offer is intended to help increase the efficiency of the business which is a necessary step towards securing our long-term future .

an official who visited the singer 's london home last year has told malawi 's high court that adoption is " in the best interests " of the two-year-old .
the boy has lived with madonna and husband guy ritchie since october 2006 after they met him in an orphanage .
an adoption hearing is scheduled to take place in malawi next week .
' no interference ' but the singer 's lawyers have asked for the hearing to be delayed until the end of april because she has another engagement in the us .
a court official said on monday that a judge would give an answer later in the day .
last year , the malawian child welfare ministry confirmed that madonna had been funding a member of ministry staff .
the singer was said to have paid for tuition and living expenses while an employee was studying in britain .

gardens and patios at knipe point are now in a heap 100ft -lrb- 30.4m -rrb- below the homes on national trust land at cayton bay , between scarborough and filey .
insurers have told one family to move out , while other locals wait for news .
a trust spokesman said the slip had been caused by water and it was impossible to predict the next one .
michael turner of the residents ' association said there was growing concern in the area .
" people are very worried because at the moment they do n't know what 's going to happen , whether there will be any more slippage .
" one family has been told to move out by their insurance company .
" we 're just waiting for the results of investigations into what caused the land slip , but at the moment we 're in limbo . "
' fits and starts ' national trust property manager bob dicker said : " we know that this land is slipping , we know it 's very active at the present time , but to put a scale on it at this stage would be unwise .
we do n't have enough information .
" what we 're finding out , in some respects it 's very obvious , we 're finding out it is a land slip and we should be very careful to remember that - it is n't coastal erosion .
" the land slip itself is caused by water for the most part , there may be other causative agents , but mainly water . "
homes are now perilously close to the edge of the cliffs mr dicker said engineers were trying to find the source of the water that caused the slip .
" what we do n't know is where is the water coming from and what sources there are in the immediate area . "
he said the land slippage had been happening in " fits and starts " and there had been quite a bit of activity for the last two or three months .
" prior to that it had been very stable , if i can use that word , for quite some time .
" but it would be very foolish of me or anybody else to predict at the present time just what will happen either today or in ten years time .
" we do hope to have more information fairly soon . "

gardens and patios at knipe point are now in a heap 100ft -lrb- 30.4m -rrb- below the homes on national trust land at cayton bay , between scarborough and filey .
insurers have told one family to move out , while other locals wait for news .
a trust spokesman said the slip had been caused by water and it was impossible to predict the next one .
michael turner of the residents ' association said there was growing concern in the area .
" people are very worried because at the moment they do n't know what 's going to happen , whether there will be any more slippage .
" one family has been told to move out by their insurance company .
" we 're just waiting for the results of investigations into what caused the land slip , but at the moment we 're in limbo . "
' fits and starts ' national trust property manager bob dicker said : " we know that this land is slipping , we know it 's very active at the present time , but to put a scale on it at this stage would be unwise .
we do n't have enough information .
" what we 're finding out , in some respects it 's very obvious , we 're finding out it is a land slip and we should be very careful to remember that - it is n't coastal erosion .
" the land slip itself is caused by water for the most part , there may be other causative agents , but mainly water . "
homes are now perilously close to the edge of the cliffs mr dicker said engineers were trying to find the source of the water that caused the slip .
" what we do n't know is where is the water coming from and what sources there are in the immediate area . "
he said the land slippage had been happening in " fits and starts " and there had been quite a bit of activity for the last two or three months .
" prior to that it had been very stable , if i can use that word , for quite some time .
" but it would be very foolish of me or anybody else to predict at the present time just what will happen either today or in ten years time .
" we do hope to have more information fairly soon . "
