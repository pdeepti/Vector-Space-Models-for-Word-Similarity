25 . with germany bracing itself for what is expected to be a deep economic downturn next year , leading companies indicated at a meeting this month with german chancellor angela merkel they would attempt to avoid large-scale lay-offs . " this creates confidence " said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- . but he conceded that all companies would not be able to follow this course , telling the dpa news agency that the forecast contraction in economic growth meant that part of industry would be unable to escape job cuts . " a drastic fall in the number of orders means several companies will be forced to cut their workforce , " said thumann . some of germany 's biggest companies offered earlier this month to abstain from mass job cuts in 2009 as a contribution to a government stimulus and recovery package expected to be agreed early next year . however , small and medium-sized companies reacted coolly to the proposals , saying they were skeptical about such pledges in such a volatile economic environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen thumann thumann 's comments came as merkel 's government begins to piece together a possible new stimulus package , which could worth from 25 to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 to $ 42 billion -rrb- , to help the nation 's economy weather the global economic slump . many economists and think tanks are pessimistic about germany 's economic outlook for 2009 .
germany is already in recession and some experts say next year 's economic performance could be the worst in the country 's post-war history . economic stimulus berlin has already set a raft of measures totalling about 31 billion euros to help ward off the global recession . however , berlin has made it clear that it does not plan to finalize the new package until after us president-elect barack obama unveiled his proposals to underpin growth in the world 's biggest economy following his inauguration later next month . merkel is also planning to hold another meeting with top german industry leaders in january to discuss their offer of job guarantees . in his interview , thumann said that it was still too early to say how badly the global economic crisis would hit germany . however , he said what was important was that the international community gave fresh impetus to the currently stalled world trade talks and hammered out a new world trade agreement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 . with germany bracing itself for what is expected to be a deep economic downturn next year , leading companies indicated at a meeting this month with german chancellor angela merkel they would attempt to avoid large-scale lay-offs . " this creates confidence " said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- . but he conceded that all companies would not be able to follow this course , telling the dpa news agency that the forecast contraction in economic growth meant that part of industry would be unable to escape job cuts . " a drastic fall in the number of orders means several companies will be forced to cut their workforce , " said thumann . some of germany 's biggest companies offered earlier this month to abstain from mass job cuts in 2009 as a contribution to a government stimulus and recovery package expected to be agreed early next year . however , small and medium-sized companies reacted coolly to the proposals , saying they were skeptical about such pledges in such a volatile economic environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen thumann thumann 's comments came as merkel 's government begins to piece together a possible new stimulus package , which could worth from 25 to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 to $ 42 billion -rrb- , to help the nation 's economy weather the global economic slump . many economists and think tanks are pessimistic about germany 's economic outlook for 2009 .
germany is already in recession and some experts say next year 's economic performance could be the worst in the country 's post-war history . economic stimulus berlin has already set a raft of measures totalling about 31 billion euros to help ward off the global recession . however , berlin has made it clear that it does not plan to finalize the new package until after us president-elect barack obama unveiled his proposals to underpin growth in the world 's biggest economy following his inauguration later next month . merkel is also planning to hold another meeting with top german industry leaders in january to discuss their offer of job guarantees . in his interview , thumann said that it was still too early to say how badly the global economic crisis would hit germany . however , he said what was important was that the international community gave fresh impetus to the currently stalled world trade talks and hammered out a new world trade agreement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 . with germany bracing itself for what is expected to be a deep economic downturn next year , leading companies indicated at a meeting this month with german chancellor angela merkel they would attempt to avoid large-scale lay-offs . " this creates confidence " said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- . but he conceded that all companies would not be able to follow this course , telling the dpa news agency that the forecast contraction in economic growth meant that part of industry would be unable to escape job cuts . " a drastic fall in the number of orders means several companies will be forced to cut their workforce , " said thumann . some of germany 's biggest companies offered earlier this month to abstain from mass job cuts in 2009 as a contribution to a government stimulus and recovery package expected to be agreed early next year . however , small and medium-sized companies reacted coolly to the proposals , saying they were skeptical about such pledges in such a volatile economic environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen thumann thumann 's comments came as merkel 's government begins to piece together a possible new stimulus package , which could worth from 25 to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 to $ 42 billion -rrb- , to help the nation 's economy weather the global economic slump . many economists and think tanks are pessimistic about germany 's economic outlook for 2009 .
germany is already in recession and some experts say next year 's economic performance could be the worst in the country 's post-war history . economic stimulus berlin has already set a raft of measures totalling about 31 billion euros to help ward off the global recession . however , berlin has made it clear that it does not plan to finalize the new package until after us president-elect barack obama unveiled his proposals to underpin growth in the world 's biggest economy following his inauguration later next month . merkel is also planning to hold another meeting with top german industry leaders in january to discuss their offer of job guarantees . in his interview , thumann said that it was still too early to say how badly the global economic crisis would hit germany . however , he said what was important was that the international community gave fresh impetus to the currently stalled world trade talks and hammered out a new world trade agreement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the islands have been pounded three times in two weeks by powerful waves caused by storm surges and high tides .
the floods have swamped the main urban centres of majuro and ebeye which are less than a metre above sea level .
government officials said the flooding showed how vulnerable the western pacific atoll nation is to small changes in weather conditions .
fears for public hygiene have intensified as the floods also hit cemeteries , " contributing to the already alarming sanitary conditions with the widespread debris caused by the high wave action " , president litokwa tomeing said .
the president said at least 600 people were forced to take refuge in government-designated shelters , churches , and with other family members .
radio australia interviewed the government 's chief secretary , casten nemira , who said damage to outer islands remained unknown until communication with them could be restored .
" over 200 plus houses were affected and some houses are completely damaged , also the cemeteries by the shore lines and erosions , " he said .
" we hope to get a complete picture in the coming days as the reports are still coming in . "
vulnerable deborah manase , deputy director of the office of environmental planning and policy coordination , said damage had been caused despite the waves that crashed into the islands being " quite small " at about five feet .
" it shows that we 're extremely vulnerable , " the afp news agency reported her as saying .
" if the tide had been two feet higher , it would have been much worse .
" at the global level , we 're trying to explain that the smallest change in sea levels will have a big impact on our islands . "
