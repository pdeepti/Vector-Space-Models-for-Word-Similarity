but this development is being driven by what experts say is a " worrying " explosion in the low-wage sector . over the past 10 years , the number of people considered to be low-wage earners in germany increased from 15 to 22 percent , reaching a total of 6.5 million people , a new study has found .
one in five germans today works in the " low-wage " sector and , as of last year , some 200,000 employed people resort to taking an additional " mini-job " to make ends meet .
" the conclusions for germany are worrying , " said gerhard bosch of the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for work , skills and training -lrb- iaq -rrb- , which carried out research for the study in britain , denmark , france , germany , the netherlands and the us .
the development is in part due to the german government , which has intentionally been expanding the low-wage sector in recent years in order to bring down the country 's high unemployment levels .
a general shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the boom in low-wage jobs , the middle class is in danger of eroding but bosch 's colleague at the iaq , dorothea voss-dahm , told dw-world.de that a general shift in society is also to blame .
" for so many years , we 've heard that germany is inflexible in its labor laws , " she said .
" now , companies and employee associations are saying , let 's try something different . "
the low-wage explosion could not have happened without the introduction in 2003 of the so-called " mini-job " in germany .
under the scheme , employees can earn 400 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- month and are exempt from paying tax and social insurance contributions .
but according to voss-dahm , employers have seized on mini-jobs as a way to push wage levels down , with the result that the wage gap is widening , and germany 's middle class shrinking .
" if the middle class erodes , then over the long term , our whole society will change , " voss-dahm said .
" the middle class is the layer upon which our society was built . "
authors surprised by unflattering picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans are learning what it feels like to be " poor despite employment " the study on low-wage sectors in europe and the us showed that , with 22 percent of the workforce considered low-wage earners , germany has already eclipsed britain -lrb- 21.7 percent -rrb- and is catching up with the us -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- .
" if the government does n't do anything to turn this around , germany 's low-wage sector could become larger than that of the us , where every fourth person is a low-wage earner , " american economist robert solow told the frankfurter rundschau .
the authors of the german study admitted that they had n't expected " such unflattering results . "
in comparison with the us , low-wage earners in germany are still better off , as the social net ensures they have health insurance , paid vacation and generous pension benefits .
but the idea that germany 's economy is bolstered by low-wage jobs and people who have to work several jobs just to survive is new .
" in germany , we 've only just begun to realize that poverty could become a problem , " said the iaq 's voss-dahm .
she said the government could take two corrective steps : abolish the mini-job regulations , which would remove the incentive for companies to lower wages ; and introduce a minimum wage which would ensure that even those in lower paying jobs can still make ends meet . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this development is being driven by what experts say is a " worrying " explosion in the low-wage sector . over the past 10 years , the number of people considered to be low-wage earners in germany increased from 15 to 22 percent , reaching a total of 6.5 million people , a new study has found .
one in five germans today works in the " low-wage " sector and , as of last year , some 200,000 employed people resort to taking an additional " mini-job " to make ends meet .
" the conclusions for germany are worrying , " said gerhard bosch of the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for work , skills and training -lrb- iaq -rrb- , which carried out research for the study in britain , denmark , france , germany , the netherlands and the us .
the development is in part due to the german government , which has intentionally been expanding the low-wage sector in recent years in order to bring down the country 's high unemployment levels .
a general shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the boom in low-wage jobs , the middle class is in danger of eroding but bosch 's colleague at the iaq , dorothea voss-dahm , told dw-world.de that a general shift in society is also to blame .
" for so many years , we 've heard that germany is inflexible in its labor laws , " she said .
" now , companies and employee associations are saying , let 's try something different . "
the low-wage explosion could not have happened without the introduction in 2003 of the so-called " mini-job " in germany .
under the scheme , employees can earn 400 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- month and are exempt from paying tax and social insurance contributions .
but according to voss-dahm , employers have seized on mini-jobs as a way to push wage levels down , with the result that the wage gap is widening , and germany 's middle class shrinking .
" if the middle class erodes , then over the long term , our whole society will change , " voss-dahm said .
" the middle class is the layer upon which our society was built . "
authors surprised by unflattering picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans are learning what it feels like to be " poor despite employment " the study on low-wage sectors in europe and the us showed that , with 22 percent of the workforce considered low-wage earners , germany has already eclipsed britain -lrb- 21.7 percent -rrb- and is catching up with the us -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- .
" if the government does n't do anything to turn this around , germany 's low-wage sector could become larger than that of the us , where every fourth person is a low-wage earner , " american economist robert solow told the frankfurter rundschau .
the authors of the german study admitted that they had n't expected " such unflattering results . "
in comparison with the us , low-wage earners in germany are still better off , as the social net ensures they have health insurance , paid vacation and generous pension benefits .
but the idea that germany 's economy is bolstered by low-wage jobs and people who have to work several jobs just to survive is new .
" in germany , we 've only just begun to realize that poverty could become a problem , " said the iaq 's voss-dahm .
she said the government could take two corrective steps : abolish the mini-job regulations , which would remove the incentive for companies to lower wages ; and introduce a minimum wage which would ensure that even those in lower paying jobs can still make ends meet . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .
climate change as a trigger of conflict the event which took place is this week was the third in the mem series first launched in september 2007 .
its stated goal was to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen conference and draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" climate change is already having a considerable impact on security , " sarkozy said in his speech to ministers from the 16 economies that together account for 80 percent of the planet 's greenhouse-gas emissions - including australia , brazil , britain , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , south korea , mexico , russia , south africa and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did climate change contribute to the darfur crisis ?
" water scarcity and rivalry for farmland and fishing resources were emerging as " major challenges , " he said , pointing to the african example .
" in darfur , we see this explosive mixture from the impact of climate change , which prompts immigration by increasingly impoverished people , which then has consequences in war . "

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .
climate change as a trigger of conflict the event which took place is this week was the third in the mem series first launched in september 2007 .
its stated goal was to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen conference and draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" climate change is already having a considerable impact on security , " sarkozy said in his speech to ministers from the 16 economies that together account for 80 percent of the planet 's greenhouse-gas emissions - including australia , brazil , britain , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , south korea , mexico , russia , south africa and the us .

" if we keep going down this path , climate change will encourage the immigration of people with nothing towards areas where the population do have something , and the darfur crisis will be only one crisis among dozens of others , " he stressed .
un secretary general ban ki-moon last june was the first to suggest that the darfur conflict arose " at least in part " from climate change .
reacting to food crisis in his speech , sarkozy also weighed into the debate over food prices , saying the current food crisis called not only for an immediate response but also for an ambitious strategy to support agriculture , and pledging to double france 's emergency food aid this year to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
" we can not remain indifferent to the unrest among those people who , in the developing countries , can no longer satisfy their hunger , " he said .

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .
climate change as a trigger of conflict the event which took place is this week was the third in the mem series first launched in september 2007 .
its stated goal was to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen conference and draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" climate change is already having a considerable impact on security , " sarkozy said in his speech to ministers from the 16 economies that together account for 80 percent of the planet 's greenhouse-gas emissions - including australia , brazil , britain , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , south korea , mexico , russia , south africa and the us .

on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .
when the group is mentioned , its platform should be denounced in the same breath .
the npd should in no way benefit from this short-sighted party conflict . hans-peter uhl is the domestic policy speaker for the cdu-csu faction in the german parliament . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .
when the group is mentioned , its platform should be denounced in the same breath .
the npd should in no way benefit from this short-sighted party conflict . hans-peter uhl is the domestic policy speaker for the cdu-csu faction in the german parliament . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i would urgently like to stress that there are very , very strict conditions ... and it is not the case that everywhere in this country secret cameras or listening devices will be installed in living spaces , " he said .
" it is about terrorist threats that would be averted through preventative measures by the federal police . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be careful what you - and your friends - say at home he added that such methods were already allowed in several german states . " recording and filming must be restricted to the suspect and the suspect 's own home these methods are also permissible in the homes of other persons if evidence shows that the suspect is present or if employing these measures solely in the home of the suspect is insufficient to contain potential risk .
the measure may also be taken if other persons are immediately at risk , " says paragraph 20 of the draft , according to the dpa news agency . in the past , such measures were illegal on the grounds that they marked a breach of the sanctities of the home and the confidentiality of private conversations .
current regulations call for police to turn off their equipment when suspect talk about private matters . a cabinet decision on what is known as the bka law is expected this summer .
the acceptability of using video cameras as well as microphones in private homes for up to a month has divided opinion among the social democrats , who share power at the federal level with chancellor angela mekel 's christian democrats . skepticism persists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cabinet ministers recently agreed spy software could be used in germany the new draft regarding video surveillance met with resistance among members of her party .
berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting -lrb- spd -rrb- and sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- , the chairman of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , were among those voicing strong skepticism . " i see no need for video surveillance in private homes , " said edathy in the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung on friday .
" there is no apparent justification . " he also stressed that his party would resist this most recent extension to bka privileges . after months of discussions , justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble -lrb- cdu -rrb- settled this week on a compromised version of the bka law , with zypries drawing the line at allowing investigators to break into homes to install spyware programs on private computers . as it stands , investigators may only access private computers via the internet . resistance remains the spd 's interior affairs expert dieter wiefelspuetz had similar reservations about the online searches . " this needs to be looked into carefully , " he said , also expressing the hope that the christian democrats ' push to allow police to break into private homes would be unsuccessful . " if they try to get this through , they will soon end up in the country 's constitutional court , " he predicted .
" covertly entering people 's homes to install spying software would only be acceptable if the constitution is changed , " he stressed . interior ministers ' conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's proposals have been described as draconian germany 's state interior ministers are ending their spring conference in the spa resort of bad saarow in brandenburg on friday . topping the agenda were the issues of online searches and a possible ban on the far-right party , the npd . in friday 's edition of the daily schweriner volkszeitung , edathy criticized the participants ' failure to make progress on the latter issue : " the majority of the cdu and the csu are unwilling to discuss creating a framework that would allow an npd ban , " he complained . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the longest serving member of germany 's government , who has been in office since 1998 , she is now taking on an honorary job for the united nations .
as the un 's special envoy , wieczorek-zeul - together with south african finance minister trevor manuel - is organizing the international conference on financing for development , which will take place in doha , qatar , from nov .
29 to dec .
2 .
the meeting is expected to focus on taking stock of current development cooperation and come up with binding assurances for the future , wieczorek-zeul said .
as part of her new role , she 'll also be responsible for helping to make the un 's millennium goals a reality .
the goals include the reduction of debt of developing country , lifting trade restrictions and strengthening the financial power of poorer countries .
red and reliable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul wants to make sure that developing countries get a chance wieczorek-zeul , also known as " red heidi " because of her leftist views and the color of her hair , said that her nomination was a confirmation of " the high level of trust in the federal government and the reliability of german politics " at the united nations .
by picking wieczorek-zeul and manuel , the un secretary general chose a representative from an industrialized and a developing country .
the doha conference is a follow-up meeting to another summit that took place in monterrey , mexico , 2002 .
in light of the global food shortage , wieczorek-zeul called for an increased support for regional agriculture in developing countries .
" we think there 's a lot of work to be done , " she told german daily neue presse , adding that combating hunger and poverty was the most important thing for her .
bad subsidies the minister is also working towards ending export subsidies for agricultural products .
she said that this was something that had to be achieved as fast as possible during negotiations at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
sending subsidized food to developing countries was preventing local production and therefore had to stop , she said .
wieczorek-zeul also reiterated her promise to offer 10 million euros -lrb- $ 15.8 million -rrb- to the un 's world food program .
she said , however , that this could not happen by cutting money from other areas of development aid .
budget battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer streinbrueck expects budget cuts from several ministries " this clearly means that development aid funds will have to rise , " said the minister , who is currently fighting with germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck over the coming budget .
steinbrueck , who is also a social democrat , recently provoked a rift within the government by telling several ministries that they had to lower their budget plans .
wieczorek-zeul is banking on german chancellor angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union .
she said that her ministry simply wants to implement the promises which the chancellor made at last year 's g8 summit . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .
when the group is mentioned , its platform should be denounced in the same breath .
the npd should in no way benefit from this short-sighted party conflict . hans-peter uhl is the domestic policy speaker for the cdu-csu faction in the german parliament . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.04.2008 opinion : denounce but do n't ban far-right npd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should denounce extremism but not ban the far-right npd , said parliamentarian hans-peter uhl .
on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .
when the group is mentioned , its platform should be denounced in the same breath .
the npd should in no way benefit from this short-sighted party conflict . hans-peter uhl is the domestic policy speaker for the cdu-csu faction in the german parliament . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i would urgently like to stress that there are very , very strict conditions ... and it is not the case that everywhere in this country secret cameras or listening devices will be installed in living spaces , " he said .
" it is about terrorist threats that would be averted through preventative measures by the federal police . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be careful what you - and your friends - say at home he added that such methods were already allowed in several german states . " recording and filming must be restricted to the suspect and the suspect 's own home these methods are also permissible in the homes of other persons if evidence shows that the suspect is present or if employing these measures solely in the home of the suspect is insufficient to contain potential risk .
the measure may also be taken if other persons are immediately at risk , " says paragraph 20 of the draft , according to the dpa news agency . in the past , such measures were illegal on the grounds that they marked a breach of the sanctities of the home and the confidentiality of private conversations .
current regulations call for police to turn off their equipment when suspect talk about private matters . a cabinet decision on what is known as the bka law is expected this summer .
the acceptability of using video cameras as well as microphones in private homes for up to a month has divided opinion among the social democrats , who share power at the federal level with chancellor angela mekel 's christian democrats . skepticism persists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cabinet ministers recently agreed spy software could be used in germany the new draft regarding video surveillance met with resistance among members of her party .
berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting -lrb- spd -rrb- and sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- , the chairman of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , were among those voicing strong skepticism . " i see no need for video surveillance in private homes , " said edathy in the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung on friday .
" there is no apparent justification . " he also stressed that his party would resist this most recent extension to bka privileges . after months of discussions , justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble -lrb- cdu -rrb- settled this week on a compromised version of the bka law , with zypries drawing the line at allowing investigators to break into homes to install spyware programs on private computers . as it stands , investigators may only access private computers via the internet . resistance remains the spd 's interior affairs expert dieter wiefelspuetz had similar reservations about the online searches . " this needs to be looked into carefully , " he said , also expressing the hope that the christian democrats ' push to allow police to break into private homes would be unsuccessful . " if they try to get this through , they will soon end up in the country 's constitutional court , " he predicted .
" covertly entering people 's homes to install spying software would only be acceptable if the constitution is changed , " he stressed . interior ministers ' conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's proposals have been described as draconian germany 's state interior ministers are ending their spring conference in the spa resort of bad saarow in brandenburg on friday . topping the agenda were the issues of online searches and a possible ban on the far-right party , the npd . in friday 's edition of the daily schweriner volkszeitung , edathy criticized the participants ' failure to make progress on the latter issue : " the majority of the cdu and the csu are unwilling to discuss creating a framework that would allow an npd ban , " he complained . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 18.04.2008 germany 's low-wage explosion worries experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20 percent of germans are employed in the low-wage sector germany 's economy appears to be humming along , with unemployment figures at their lowest in 15 years .
but this development is being driven by what experts say is a " worrying " explosion in the low-wage sector . over the past 10 years , the number of people considered to be low-wage earners in germany increased from 15 to 22 percent , reaching a total of 6.5 million people , a new study has found .
one in five germans today works in the " low-wage " sector and , as of last year , some 200,000 employed people resort to taking an additional " mini-job " to make ends meet .
" the conclusions for germany are worrying , " said gerhard bosch of the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for work , skills and training -lrb- iaq -rrb- , which carried out research for the study in britain , denmark , france , germany , the netherlands and the us .
the development is in part due to the german government , which has intentionally been expanding the low-wage sector in recent years in order to bring down the country 's high unemployment levels .
a general shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the boom in low-wage jobs , the middle class is in danger of eroding but bosch 's colleague at the iaq , dorothea voss-dahm , told dw-world.de that a general shift in society is also to blame .
" for so many years , we 've heard that germany is inflexible in its labor laws , " she said .
" now , companies and employee associations are saying , let 's try something different . "
the low-wage explosion could not have happened without the introduction in 2003 of the so-called " mini-job " in germany .
under the scheme , employees can earn 400 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- month and are exempt from paying tax and social insurance contributions .
but according to voss-dahm , employers have seized on mini-jobs as a way to push wage levels down , with the result that the wage gap is widening , and germany 's middle class shrinking .
" if the middle class erodes , then over the long term , our whole society will change , " voss-dahm said .
" the middle class is the layer upon which our society was built . "
authors surprised by unflattering picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans are learning what it feels like to be " poor despite employment " the study on low-wage sectors in europe and the us showed that , with 22 percent of the workforce considered low-wage earners , germany has already eclipsed britain -lrb- 21.7 percent -rrb- and is catching up with the us -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- .
" if the government does n't do anything to turn this around , germany 's low-wage sector could become larger than that of the us , where every fourth person is a low-wage earner , " american economist robert solow told the frankfurter rundschau .
the authors of the german study admitted that they had n't expected " such unflattering results . "
in comparison with the us , low-wage earners in germany are still better off , as the social net ensures they have health insurance , paid vacation and generous pension benefits .
but the idea that germany 's economy is bolstered by low-wage jobs and people who have to work several jobs just to survive is new .
" in germany , we 've only just begun to realize that poverty could become a problem , " said the iaq 's voss-dahm .
she said the government could take two corrective steps : abolish the mini-job regulations , which would remove the incentive for companies to lower wages ; and introduce a minimum wage which would ensure that even those in lower paying jobs can still make ends meet . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this development is being driven by what experts say is a " worrying " explosion in the low-wage sector . over the past 10 years , the number of people considered to be low-wage earners in germany increased from 15 to 22 percent , reaching a total of 6.5 million people , a new study has found .
one in five germans today works in the " low-wage " sector and , as of last year , some 200,000 employed people resort to taking an additional " mini-job " to make ends meet .
" the conclusions for germany are worrying , " said gerhard bosch of the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for work , skills and training -lrb- iaq -rrb- , which carried out research for the study in britain , denmark , france , germany , the netherlands and the us .
the development is in part due to the german government , which has intentionally been expanding the low-wage sector in recent years in order to bring down the country 's high unemployment levels .
a general shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the boom in low-wage jobs , the middle class is in danger of eroding but bosch 's colleague at the iaq , dorothea voss-dahm , told dw-world.de that a general shift in society is also to blame .
" for so many years , we 've heard that germany is inflexible in its labor laws , " she said .
" now , companies and employee associations are saying , let 's try something different . "
the low-wage explosion could not have happened without the introduction in 2003 of the so-called " mini-job " in germany .
under the scheme , employees can earn 400 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- month and are exempt from paying tax and social insurance contributions .
but according to voss-dahm , employers have seized on mini-jobs as a way to push wage levels down , with the result that the wage gap is widening , and germany 's middle class shrinking .
" if the middle class erodes , then over the long term , our whole society will change , " voss-dahm said .
" the middle class is the layer upon which our society was built . "
authors surprised by unflattering picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans are learning what it feels like to be " poor despite employment " the study on low-wage sectors in europe and the us showed that , with 22 percent of the workforce considered low-wage earners , germany has already eclipsed britain -lrb- 21.7 percent -rrb- and is catching up with the us -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- .
" if the government does n't do anything to turn this around , germany 's low-wage sector could become larger than that of the us , where every fourth person is a low-wage earner , " american economist robert solow told the frankfurter rundschau .
the authors of the german study admitted that they had n't expected " such unflattering results . "
in comparison with the us , low-wage earners in germany are still better off , as the social net ensures they have health insurance , paid vacation and generous pension benefits .
but the idea that germany 's economy is bolstered by low-wage jobs and people who have to work several jobs just to survive is new .

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .

" in darfur , we see this explosive mixture from the impact of climate change , which prompts immigration by increasingly impoverished people , which then has consequences in war . "
" if we keep going down this path , climate change will encourage the immigration of people with nothing towards areas where the population do have something , and the darfur crisis will be only one crisis among dozens of others , " he stressed .
un secretary general ban ki-moon last june was the first to suggest that the darfur conflict arose " at least in part " from climate change .
reacting to food crisis in his speech , sarkozy also weighed into the debate over food prices , saying the current food crisis called not only for an immediate response but also for an ambitious strategy to support agriculture , and pledging to double france 's emergency food aid this year to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
" we can not remain indifferent to the unrest among those people who , in the developing countries , can no longer satisfy their hunger , " he said .
soaring prices for basic grains such as rice , wheat , soybean and corn , have provoked protests and rioting in at least half a dozen developing countries in past months , reports afp .

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .
climate change as a trigger of conflict the event which took place is this week was the third in the mem series first launched in september 2007 .
its stated goal was to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen conference and draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" climate change is already having a considerable impact on security , " sarkozy said in his speech to ministers from the 16 economies that together account for 80 percent of the planet 's greenhouse-gas emissions - including australia , brazil , britain , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , south korea , mexico , russia , south africa and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did climate change contribute to the darfur crisis ?
" water scarcity and rivalry for farmland and fishing resources were emerging as " major challenges , " he said , pointing to the african example .
" in darfur , we see this explosive mixture from the impact of climate change , which prompts immigration by increasingly impoverished people , which then has consequences in war . "
" if we keep going down this path , climate change will encourage the immigration of people with nothing towards areas where the population do have something , and the darfur crisis will be only one crisis among dozens of others , " he stressed .
un secretary general ban ki-moon last june was the first to suggest that the darfur conflict arose " at least in part " from climate change .
reacting to food crisis in his speech , sarkozy also weighed into the debate over food prices , saying the current food crisis called not only for an immediate response but also for an ambitious strategy to support agriculture , and pledging to double france 's emergency food aid this year to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
" we can not remain indifferent to the unrest among those people who , in the developing countries , can no longer satisfy their hunger , " he said .
soaring prices for basic grains such as rice , wheat , soybean and corn , have provoked protests and rioting in at least half a dozen developing countries in past months , reports afp .
experts have pinpointed climate change as a factor here too , arguing that rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns may be contributing to water scarcity .
biofuels , championed to help reduce carbon emissions and ease dependence on fossil fuels , have also started to become contentious .
with programs such as those in the us and brazil converting grains , sugar and soy beans into ethanol and biodiesel , the boom in biofuels has become key to the food crisis .

bush said on wednesday that he wanted us emissions to peak by 2025 , a measure dismissed as too little too late by the eu and germany , with german environment minister sigmar gabriel describing the plan as " neanderthal . "
the white house on thursday played down germany 's criticism .
" you 're always going to see lots of hot-blooded reaction to anything said on climate , and so you should just be prepared for that , " said tony fratto , a white house spokesman .
fratto said climate change is such a contentious issue that it was no surprise that bush faced criticism over his proposal .
" slings and arrows would have been thrown no matter what we said , and that 's the nature of the debate on climate change , " fratto said .
" and you 're never going to make everyone happy on it . "
sarkozy refrained on friday from referring directly to the us feet-dragging , but his message was clear .

on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .
when the group is mentioned , its platform should be denounced in the same breath .
the npd should in no way benefit from this short-sighted party conflict . hans-peter uhl is the domestic policy speaker for the cdu-csu faction in the german parliament . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.04.2008 opinion : denounce but do n't ban far-right npd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should denounce extremism but not ban the far-right npd , said parliamentarian hans-peter uhl .
on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .

but this development is being driven by what experts say is a " worrying " explosion in the low-wage sector . over the past 10 years , the number of people considered to be low-wage earners in germany increased from 15 to 22 percent , reaching a total of 6.5 million people , a new study has found .
one in five germans today works in the " low-wage " sector and , as of last year , some 200,000 employed people resort to taking an additional " mini-job " to make ends meet .
" the conclusions for germany are worrying , " said gerhard bosch of the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for work , skills and training -lrb- iaq -rrb- , which carried out research for the study in britain , denmark , france , germany , the netherlands and the us .
the development is in part due to the german government , which has intentionally been expanding the low-wage sector in recent years in order to bring down the country 's high unemployment levels .
a general shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the boom in low-wage jobs , the middle class is in danger of eroding but bosch 's colleague at the iaq , dorothea voss-dahm , told dw-world.de that a general shift in society is also to blame .
" for so many years , we 've heard that germany is inflexible in its labor laws , " she said .
" now , companies and employee associations are saying , let 's try something different . "
the low-wage explosion could not have happened without the introduction in 2003 of the so-called " mini-job " in germany .
under the scheme , employees can earn 400 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- month and are exempt from paying tax and social insurance contributions .
but according to voss-dahm , employers have seized on mini-jobs as a way to push wage levels down , with the result that the wage gap is widening , and germany 's middle class shrinking .
" if the middle class erodes , then over the long term , our whole society will change , " voss-dahm said .
" the middle class is the layer upon which our society was built . "

" if the government does n't do anything to turn this around , germany 's low-wage sector could become larger than that of the us , where every fourth person is a low-wage earner , " american economist robert solow told the frankfurter rundschau .
the authors of the german study admitted that they had n't expected " such unflattering results . "
in comparison with the us , low-wage earners in germany are still better off , as the social net ensures they have health insurance , paid vacation and generous pension benefits .
but the idea that germany 's economy is bolstered by low-wage jobs and people who have to work several jobs just to survive is new .
" in germany , we 've only just begun to realize that poverty could become a problem , " said the iaq 's voss-dahm .

but this development is being driven by what experts say is a " worrying " explosion in the low-wage sector . over the past 10 years , the number of people considered to be low-wage earners in germany increased from 15 to 22 percent , reaching a total of 6.5 million people , a new study has found .
one in five germans today works in the " low-wage " sector and , as of last year , some 200,000 employed people resort to taking an additional " mini-job " to make ends meet .
" the conclusions for germany are worrying , " said gerhard bosch of the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for work , skills and training -lrb- iaq -rrb- , which carried out research for the study in britain , denmark , france , germany , the netherlands and the us .
the development is in part due to the german government , which has intentionally been expanding the low-wage sector in recent years in order to bring down the country 's high unemployment levels .
a general shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the boom in low-wage jobs , the middle class is in danger of eroding but bosch 's colleague at the iaq , dorothea voss-dahm , told dw-world.de that a general shift in society is also to blame .
" for so many years , we 've heard that germany is inflexible in its labor laws , " she said .
" now , companies and employee associations are saying , let 's try something different . "
the low-wage explosion could not have happened without the introduction in 2003 of the so-called " mini-job " in germany .
under the scheme , employees can earn 400 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- month and are exempt from paying tax and social insurance contributions .
but according to voss-dahm , employers have seized on mini-jobs as a way to push wage levels down , with the result that the wage gap is widening , and germany 's middle class shrinking .
" if the middle class erodes , then over the long term , our whole society will change , " voss-dahm said .
" the middle class is the layer upon which our society was built . "
authors surprised by unflattering picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans are learning what it feels like to be " poor despite employment " the study on low-wage sectors in europe and the us showed that , with 22 percent of the workforce considered low-wage earners , germany has already eclipsed britain -lrb- 21.7 percent -rrb- and is catching up with the us -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- .
" if the government does n't do anything to turn this around , germany 's low-wage sector could become larger than that of the us , where every fourth person is a low-wage earner , " american economist robert solow told the frankfurter rundschau .
the authors of the german study admitted that they had n't expected " such unflattering results . "
in comparison with the us , low-wage earners in germany are still better off , as the social net ensures they have health insurance , paid vacation and generous pension benefits .
but the idea that germany 's economy is bolstered by low-wage jobs and people who have to work several jobs just to survive is new .
" in germany , we 've only just begun to realize that poverty could become a problem , " said the iaq 's voss-dahm .
she said the government could take two corrective steps : abolish the mini-job regulations , which would remove the incentive for companies to lower wages ; and introduce a minimum wage which would ensure that even those in lower paying jobs can still make ends meet . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the longest serving member of germany 's government , who has been in office since 1998 , she is now taking on an honorary job for the united nations .
as the un 's special envoy , wieczorek-zeul - together with south african finance minister trevor manuel - is organizing the international conference on financing for development , which will take place in doha , qatar , from nov .
29 to dec .
2 .
the meeting is expected to focus on taking stock of current development cooperation and come up with binding assurances for the future , wieczorek-zeul said .
as part of her new role , she 'll also be responsible for helping to make the un 's millennium goals a reality .
the goals include the reduction of debt of developing country , lifting trade restrictions and strengthening the financial power of poorer countries .
red and reliable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul wants to make sure that developing countries get a chance wieczorek-zeul , also known as " red heidi " because of her leftist views and the color of her hair , said that her nomination was a confirmation of " the high level of trust in the federal government and the reliability of german politics " at the united nations .
by picking wieczorek-zeul and manuel , the un secretary general chose a representative from an industrialized and a developing country .
the doha conference is a follow-up meeting to another summit that took place in monterrey , mexico , 2002 .
in light of the global food shortage , wieczorek-zeul called for an increased support for regional agriculture in developing countries .
" we think there 's a lot of work to be done , " she told german daily neue presse , adding that combating hunger and poverty was the most important thing for her .
bad subsidies the minister is also working towards ending export subsidies for agricultural products .
she said that this was something that had to be achieved as fast as possible during negotiations at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
sending subsidized food to developing countries was preventing local production and therefore had to stop , she said .
wieczorek-zeul also reiterated her promise to offer 10 million euros -lrb- $ 15.8 million -rrb- to the un 's world food program .
she said , however , that this could not happen by cutting money from other areas of development aid .
budget battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer streinbrueck expects budget cuts from several ministries " this clearly means that development aid funds will have to rise , " said the minister , who is currently fighting with germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck over the coming budget .
steinbrueck , who is also a social democrat , recently provoked a rift within the government by telling several ministries that they had to lower their budget plans .
wieczorek-zeul is banking on german chancellor angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union .
she said that her ministry simply wants to implement the promises which the chancellor made at last year 's g8 summit . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .
climate change as a trigger of conflict the event which took place is this week was the third in the mem series first launched in september 2007 .
its stated goal was to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen conference and draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" climate change is already having a considerable impact on security , " sarkozy said in his speech to ministers from the 16 economies that together account for 80 percent of the planet 's greenhouse-gas emissions - including australia , brazil , britain , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , south korea , mexico , russia , south africa and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did climate change contribute to the darfur crisis ?
" water scarcity and rivalry for farmland and fishing resources were emerging as " major challenges , " he said , pointing to the african example .
" in darfur , we see this explosive mixture from the impact of climate change , which prompts immigration by increasingly impoverished people , which then has consequences in war . "
" if we keep going down this path , climate change will encourage the immigration of people with nothing towards areas where the population do have something , and the darfur crisis will be only one crisis among dozens of others , " he stressed .
un secretary general ban ki-moon last june was the first to suggest that the darfur conflict arose " at least in part " from climate change .
reacting to food crisis in his speech , sarkozy also weighed into the debate over food prices , saying the current food crisis called not only for an immediate response but also for an ambitious strategy to support agriculture , and pledging to double france 's emergency food aid this year to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
" we can not remain indifferent to the unrest among those people who , in the developing countries , can no longer satisfy their hunger , " he said .
soaring prices for basic grains such as rice , wheat , soybean and corn , have provoked protests and rioting in at least half a dozen developing countries in past months , reports afp .
experts have pinpointed climate change as a factor here too , arguing that rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns may be contributing to water scarcity .
biofuels , championed to help reduce carbon emissions and ease dependence on fossil fuels , have also started to become contentious .
with programs such as those in the us and brazil converting grains , sugar and soy beans into ethanol and biodiesel , the boom in biofuels has become key to the food crisis .
bush-bashing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush 's environment policies have been described as " neanderthal " tempers had flared at the meeting on thursday when criticism was leveled at us president george w. bush 's new climate plan .
bush said on wednesday that he wanted us emissions to peak by 2025 , a measure dismissed as too little too late by the eu and germany , with german environment minister sigmar gabriel describing the plan as " neanderthal . "
the white house on thursday played down germany 's criticism .
" you 're always going to see lots of hot-blooded reaction to anything said on climate , and so you should just be prepared for that , " said tony fratto , a white house spokesman .
fratto said climate change is such a contentious issue that it was no surprise that bush faced criticism over his proposal .
" slings and arrows would have been thrown no matter what we said , and that 's the nature of the debate on climate change , " fratto said .
" and you 're never going to make everyone happy on it . "
sarkozy refrained on friday from referring directly to the us feet-dragging , but his message was clear .
" we can not afford the luxury that one of you remains behind by the roadside because the whole planet needs every one of you , " he said .
" i would like to pass on a simple message to you : the situation is urgent . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.04.2008 opinion : denounce but do n't ban far-right npd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should denounce extremism but not ban the far-right npd , said parliamentarian hans-peter uhl .
on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .
when the group is mentioned , its platform should be denounced in the same breath .
the npd should in no way benefit from this short-sighted party conflict . hans-peter uhl is the domestic policy speaker for the cdu-csu faction in the german parliament . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israel should curb the fanaticism of jewish settlers , said the delegation . the german delegation reacted hesitantly to an apology issued by officials from the jewish settlement in the west bank city of hebron on thursday , april 17 . jerzy montag , a parliamentarian for the greens who had been in hebron the previous day with six other representatives from a german judicial committee , called the incident " completely unacceptable . " the committee members had said that israeli security forces were unwilling to intervene when hebron residents began hurling insults and threats at them and that their visit could not be continued . " it was certainly just a few of the residents who hindered our visit , " the parliamentarians said in a joint statement issued thursday . germans blamed for not seeking dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy montag said threats were directed at the german delegation david wilder , spokesman for the jewish community , said the people 's resentment was not directed at the german politicians but at their israeli guides , who were allegedly biased against the jewish settlers . montag disagreed , however , saying the insults and threats were indeed directed at the german delegation . wilder also accused the visitors of not seeking to engage in dialogue with the jewish community in hebron .
the 800-member community lives under military protection amidst more than 100,000 palestinians . " many of us lost german roots and family members during the holocaust , " said wilder .
" when germans come to hebron , they should at least meet with members of the community . " montag called this a " grotesque twisting of the truth . "
he said he was willing to talk with the settlers , but not after being insulted and threatened . in their statement , the judicial committee appealed to the israeli authorities " to curb the fanaticism of the jewish settlers .

on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .
when the group is mentioned , its platform should be denounced in the same breath .
the npd should in no way benefit from this short-sighted party conflict . hans-peter uhl is the domestic policy speaker for the cdu-csu faction in the german parliament . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israel should curb the fanaticism of jewish settlers , said the delegation . the german delegation reacted hesitantly to an apology issued by officials from the jewish settlement in the west bank city of hebron on thursday , april 17 . jerzy montag , a parliamentarian for the greens who had been in hebron the previous day with six other representatives from a german judicial committee , called the incident " completely unacceptable . " the committee members had said that israeli security forces were unwilling to intervene when hebron residents began hurling insults and threats at them and that their visit could not be continued . " it was certainly just a few of the residents who hindered our visit , " the parliamentarians said in a joint statement issued thursday . germans blamed for not seeking dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy montag said threats were directed at the german delegation david wilder , spokesman for the jewish community , said the people 's resentment was not directed at the german politicians but at their israeli guides , who were allegedly biased against the jewish settlers . montag disagreed , however , saying the insults and threats were indeed directed at the german delegation . wilder also accused the visitors of not seeking to engage in dialogue with the jewish community in hebron .
the 800-member community lives under military protection amidst more than 100,000 palestinians . " many of us lost german roots and family members during the holocaust , " said wilder .
" when germans come to hebron , they should at least meet with members of the community . " montag called this a " grotesque twisting of the truth . "
he said he was willing to talk with the settlers , but not after being insulted and threatened . in their statement , the judicial committee appealed to the israeli authorities " to curb the fanaticism of the jewish settlers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.04.2008 unlikely hamburg coalition no marriage of love großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new five-party system has led to the reconsideration of traditional alliances in a first-ever coalition agreement at the state level , the conservative christian democratic union have signed a deal with the greens .
the german press says the strategic move is risky , but unavoidable . the landmark coalition agreement signed on thursday , april 17 , in hamburg 's city hall , follows five weeks of intensive political negotiations that centered on energy and environmental issues .
it is expected to be formally approved by party executives at the end of the month . " in politics as in normal life , it is important to have the strength and the courage to walk new paths , " said hamburg 's cdu mayor ole von beust .
" it 's not an experiment but a chance ...
even if it may seem unusual to many , i 'm convinced it 'll be a success for hamburg . " von beust lost his absolute majority in the feb .
24 state elections and his party has since then been on the search for a suitable coalition partner . berlin wo n't follow suit , says chancellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gave her blessing but said hamburg would n't set an example for berlin chancellor angela merkel , who is also head of the cdu , welcomed the new partnership in the city-state of hamburg , but denied speculations that it could be a sign of things to come at the federal level . the greens have typically partnered with the spd and the cdu has traditionally found an ally in the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , but the addition of fifth party - the left party - has forced political camps to rethink their well-practice two-party alliances . for both the cdu and the greens in hamburg , " it 's just about opening up new options in the new five-party system , " wrote the financial times deutschland on friday .
" for chancellor and cdu chairwoman angela merkel , nothing less than securing her chancellorship beyond the election year 2009 and the likely end of the grand coalition -lsb- of the cdu and spd -rsb- are at stake .
for this goal , serious conflicts are simply papered over , particularly in the areas of economic and energy policy . " coal question remains unanswered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants large ships to be able to access hamburg 's port indeed , energy was a key point in negotiations between the two sides .
the cdu plans to build a large coal-fired power station within the city limits , which the greens oppose .
no agreement was reached before the coalition deal was written up . however , the environmental party did yield to a cdu-supported initiative to deepen the elbe river so that large container ships can access one of europe 's largest ports . " now older and wiser , the children who had once run away from the middle-class are coming back , " opined the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday from munich .
" the greens are becoming the junior partner of the party that they once considered to represent the bleak , stale , unenlightened middle-class .
and ole von beust ... is making it easy for them because he has a big heart . " von beust partnered with the far-right party pro from 2001 to 2004 , the paper pointed out , and has now turned to the greens at the other end of the political spectrum .
" that ’ s not a lack of principles ; it 's politics .
above all , politics is concerned with power . " " a break in germany 's party history " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have von beust and greens head christa goetsch pushed the problems under the rug ?
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said that it 's not just the greens who are changing their image , but the cdu as well , " breaking out of its middle-class camp was of utmost priority for the cdu . " one does n't have to think hard about the current developments in the party landscape to figure out why the cdu is doing this to itself .
if it had limited itself to its previous coalition possibilities - grand coalition or black-yellow -lsb- cdu-fdp -rsb- - the conservatives ' government possibilities could be counted on one hand . " even with just this one state collation , the cdu " can still put pressure on its traditional coalition partner , " continued the paper . berlin 's tagesspiegel considers the milestone coalition " a break in germany 's party history . " " if it 's successful , the hamburg coalition will contribute to the de-ideologization of german politics , so that it 's no longer membership in a political camp but agreement on individual issues that will determine how governments are built , " wrote the paper on friday . " for the voters , that means that politics is becoming less predictable and more complicated .

the german press says the strategic move is risky , but unavoidable . the landmark coalition agreement signed on thursday , april 17 , in hamburg 's city hall , follows five weeks of intensive political negotiations that centered on energy and environmental issues .
it is expected to be formally approved by party executives at the end of the month . " in politics as in normal life , it is important to have the strength and the courage to walk new paths , " said hamburg 's cdu mayor ole von beust .
" it 's not an experiment but a chance ...
even if it may seem unusual to many , i 'm convinced it 'll be a success for hamburg . " von beust lost his absolute majority in the feb .
24 state elections and his party has since then been on the search for a suitable coalition partner . berlin wo n't follow suit , says chancellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gave her blessing but said hamburg would n't set an example for berlin chancellor angela merkel , who is also head of the cdu , welcomed the new partnership in the city-state of hamburg , but denied speculations that it could be a sign of things to come at the federal level . the greens have typically partnered with the spd and the cdu has traditionally found an ally in the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , but the addition of fifth party - the left party - has forced political camps to rethink their well-practice two-party alliances . for both the cdu and the greens in hamburg , " it 's just about opening up new options in the new five-party system , " wrote the financial times deutschland on friday .
" for chancellor and cdu chairwoman angela merkel , nothing less than securing her chancellorship beyond the election year 2009 and the likely end of the grand coalition -lsb- of the cdu and spd -rsb- are at stake .
for this goal , serious conflicts are simply papered over , particularly in the areas of economic and energy policy . " coal question remains unanswered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants large ships to be able to access hamburg 's port indeed , energy was a key point in negotiations between the two sides .
the cdu plans to build a large coal-fired power station within the city limits , which the greens oppose .
no agreement was reached before the coalition deal was written up . however , the environmental party did yield to a cdu-supported initiative to deepen the elbe river so that large container ships can access one of europe 's largest ports . " now older and wiser , the children who had once run away from the middle-class are coming back , " opined the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday from munich .
" the greens are becoming the junior partner of the party that they once considered to represent the bleak , stale , unenlightened middle-class .
and ole von beust ... is making it easy for them because he has a big heart . " von beust partnered with the far-right party pro from 2001 to 2004 , the paper pointed out , and has now turned to the greens at the other end of the political spectrum .
" that ’ s not a lack of principles ; it 's politics .
above all , politics is concerned with power . " " a break in germany 's party history " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have von beust and greens head christa goetsch pushed the problems under the rug ?
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said that it 's not just the greens who are changing their image , but the cdu as well , " breaking out of its middle-class camp was of utmost priority for the cdu . " one does n't have to think hard about the current developments in the party landscape to figure out why the cdu is doing this to itself .
if it had limited itself to its previous coalition possibilities - grand coalition or black-yellow -lsb- cdu-fdp -rsb- - the conservatives ' government possibilities could be counted on one hand . " even with just this one state collation , the cdu " can still put pressure on its traditional coalition partner , " continued the paper . berlin 's tagesspiegel considers the milestone coalition " a break in germany 's party history . " " if it 's successful , the hamburg coalition will contribute to the de-ideologization of german politics , so that it 's no longer membership in a political camp but agreement on individual issues that will determine how governments are built , " wrote the paper on friday . " for the voters , that means that politics is becoming less predictable and more complicated .

israel should curb the fanaticism of jewish settlers , said the delegation . the german delegation reacted hesitantly to an apology issued by officials from the jewish settlement in the west bank city of hebron on thursday , april 17 . jerzy montag , a parliamentarian for the greens who had been in hebron the previous day with six other representatives from a german judicial committee , called the incident " completely unacceptable . " the committee members had said that israeli security forces were unwilling to intervene when hebron residents began hurling insults and threats at them and that their visit could not be continued . " it was certainly just a few of the residents who hindered our visit , " the parliamentarians said in a joint statement issued thursday . germans blamed for not seeking dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy montag said threats were directed at the german delegation david wilder , spokesman for the jewish community , said the people 's resentment was not directed at the german politicians but at their israeli guides , who were allegedly biased against the jewish settlers . montag disagreed , however , saying the insults and threats were indeed directed at the german delegation . wilder also accused the visitors of not seeking to engage in dialogue with the jewish community in hebron .
the 800-member community lives under military protection amidst more than 100,000 palestinians . " many of us lost german roots and family members during the holocaust , " said wilder .
" when germans come to hebron , they should at least meet with members of the community . " montag called this a " grotesque twisting of the truth . "
he said he was willing to talk with the settlers , but not after being insulted and threatened . in their statement , the judicial committee appealed to the israeli authorities " to curb the fanaticism of the jewish settlers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.04.2008 opinion : denounce but do n't ban far-right npd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should denounce extremism but not ban the far-right npd , said parliamentarian hans-peter uhl .
on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .
when the group is mentioned , its platform should be denounced in the same breath .
the npd should in no way benefit from this short-sighted party conflict . hans-peter uhl is the domestic policy speaker for the cdu-csu faction in the german parliament . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's just as well he was wrong . after news of this david and goliath tale spread around the world , nasa brought the international media back to earth with a bump on wednesday when it issued a statement says the whiz kid was wrong .
the agency said its figures are correct when it comes to the asteroid apophis , not the boy 's .
" we stand by our numbers , " nasa spokesman dwayne brown told afp .
stars in his eyes the agency that oversees space shuttle missions and unmanned space probes made its comments after the german newspaper potsdamer neuester nachrichten reported on tuesday that supremely self-confident local teenager nico marquardt had calculated there was a 1 in 450 chance that the apophis asteroid will collide with earth .
in a project for a regional science competition , marquardt set out to demonstrate that scientists at nasa had got it wrong when they estimated the chances of a collision at only 1 in 45,000 .
he might have slipped up , but the junior astronomer certainly had some of the world 's finest scientific minds worried there .
protesting too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not doomsday just yet experts at the agency 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california , insist they never had any doubts about their calculations , brown said .
the near-earth object program office " has not changed its current estimates for the very low probability -lrb- 1 in 45,000 -rrb- of an earth impact by the asteroid apophis in 2036 , " brown said in a statement .
the student 's estimates were reportedly based on the asteroid hitting a satellite in 2029 .
" however , the asteroid will not pass near the main belt of geosynchronous satellites in 2029 , and the chance of a collision with a satellite is exceedingly remote , " said the statement . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this development is being driven by what experts say is a " worrying " explosion in the low-wage sector . over the past 10 years , the number of people considered to be low-wage earners in germany increased from 15 to 22 percent , reaching a total of 6.5 million people , a new study has found .
one in five germans today works in the " low-wage " sector and , as of last year , some 200,000 employed people resort to taking an additional " mini-job " to make ends meet .
" the conclusions for germany are worrying , " said gerhard bosch of the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for work , skills and training -lrb- iaq -rrb- , which carried out research for the study in britain , denmark , france , germany , the netherlands and the us .
the development is in part due to the german government , which has intentionally been expanding the low-wage sector in recent years in order to bring down the country 's high unemployment levels .
a general shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the boom in low-wage jobs , the middle class is in danger of eroding but bosch 's colleague at the iaq , dorothea voss-dahm , told dw-world.de that a general shift in society is also to blame .
" for so many years , we 've heard that germany is inflexible in its labor laws , " she said .
" now , companies and employee associations are saying , let 's try something different . "
the low-wage explosion could not have happened without the introduction in 2003 of the so-called " mini-job " in germany .
under the scheme , employees can earn 400 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- month and are exempt from paying tax and social insurance contributions .
but according to voss-dahm , employers have seized on mini-jobs as a way to push wage levels down , with the result that the wage gap is widening , and germany 's middle class shrinking .
" if the middle class erodes , then over the long term , our whole society will change , " voss-dahm said .
" the middle class is the layer upon which our society was built . "
authors surprised by unflattering picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans are learning what it feels like to be " poor despite employment " the study on low-wage sectors in europe and the us showed that , with 22 percent of the workforce considered low-wage earners , germany has already eclipsed britain -lrb- 21.7 percent -rrb- and is catching up with the us -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- .
" if the government does n't do anything to turn this around , germany 's low-wage sector could become larger than that of the us , where every fourth person is a low-wage earner , " american economist robert solow told the frankfurter rundschau .
the authors of the german study admitted that they had n't expected " such unflattering results . "
in comparison with the us , low-wage earners in germany are still better off , as the social net ensures they have health insurance , paid vacation and generous pension benefits .
but the idea that germany 's economy is bolstered by low-wage jobs and people who have to work several jobs just to survive is new .
" in germany , we 've only just begun to realize that poverty could become a problem , " said the iaq 's voss-dahm .
she said the government could take two corrective steps : abolish the mini-job regulations , which would remove the incentive for companies to lower wages ; and introduce a minimum wage which would ensure that even those in lower paying jobs can still make ends meet . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this development is being driven by what experts say is a " worrying " explosion in the low-wage sector . over the past 10 years , the number of people considered to be low-wage earners in germany increased from 15 to 22 percent , reaching a total of 6.5 million people , a new study has found .
one in five germans today works in the " low-wage " sector and , as of last year , some 200,000 employed people resort to taking an additional " mini-job " to make ends meet .
" the conclusions for germany are worrying , " said gerhard bosch of the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for work , skills and training -lrb- iaq -rrb- , which carried out research for the study in britain , denmark , france , germany , the netherlands and the us .
the development is in part due to the german government , which has intentionally been expanding the low-wage sector in recent years in order to bring down the country 's high unemployment levels .
a general shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the boom in low-wage jobs , the middle class is in danger of eroding but bosch 's colleague at the iaq , dorothea voss-dahm , told dw-world.de that a general shift in society is also to blame .
" for so many years , we 've heard that germany is inflexible in its labor laws , " she said .
" now , companies and employee associations are saying , let 's try something different . "
the low-wage explosion could not have happened without the introduction in 2003 of the so-called " mini-job " in germany .
under the scheme , employees can earn 400 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- month and are exempt from paying tax and social insurance contributions .
but according to voss-dahm , employers have seized on mini-jobs as a way to push wage levels down , with the result that the wage gap is widening , and germany 's middle class shrinking .
" if the middle class erodes , then over the long term , our whole society will change , " voss-dahm said .
" the middle class is the layer upon which our society was built . "
authors surprised by unflattering picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans are learning what it feels like to be " poor despite employment " the study on low-wage sectors in europe and the us showed that , with 22 percent of the workforce considered low-wage earners , germany has already eclipsed britain -lrb- 21.7 percent -rrb- and is catching up with the us -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- .
" if the government does n't do anything to turn this around , germany 's low-wage sector could become larger than that of the us , where every fourth person is a low-wage earner , " american economist robert solow told the frankfurter rundschau .
the authors of the german study admitted that they had n't expected " such unflattering results . "
in comparison with the us , low-wage earners in germany are still better off , as the social net ensures they have health insurance , paid vacation and generous pension benefits .
but the idea that germany 's economy is bolstered by low-wage jobs and people who have to work several jobs just to survive is new .
" in germany , we 've only just begun to realize that poverty could become a problem , " said the iaq 's voss-dahm .
she said the government could take two corrective steps : abolish the mini-job regulations , which would remove the incentive for companies to lower wages ; and introduce a minimum wage which would ensure that even those in lower paying jobs can still make ends meet . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's just as well he was wrong . after news of this david and goliath tale spread around the world , nasa brought the international media back to earth with a bump on wednesday when it issued a statement says the whiz kid was wrong .
the agency said its figures are correct when it comes to the asteroid apophis , not the boy 's .
" we stand by our numbers , " nasa spokesman dwayne brown told afp .
stars in his eyes the agency that oversees space shuttle missions and unmanned space probes made its comments after the german newspaper potsdamer neuester nachrichten reported on tuesday that supremely self-confident local teenager nico marquardt had calculated there was a 1 in 450 chance that the apophis asteroid will collide with earth .
in a project for a regional science competition , marquardt set out to demonstrate that scientists at nasa had got it wrong when they estimated the chances of a collision at only 1 in 45,000 .
he might have slipped up , but the junior astronomer certainly had some of the world 's finest scientific minds worried there .
protesting too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not doomsday just yet experts at the agency 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california , insist they never had any doubts about their calculations , brown said .
the near-earth object program office " has not changed its current estimates for the very low probability -lrb- 1 in 45,000 -rrb- of an earth impact by the asteroid apophis in 2036 , " brown said in a statement .
the student 's estimates were reportedly based on the asteroid hitting a satellite in 2029 .
" however , the asteroid will not pass near the main belt of geosynchronous satellites in 2029 , and the chance of a collision with a satellite is exceedingly remote , " said the statement . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we demand that russia stop all actions which breach georgia 's sovereignty , " the former soviet republic 's pro-western president , mikhail saakashvili , told ministers at a cabinet meeting , his press office said thursday , april 17 . " the russian federation has made yet another extremely dangerous step towards the de facto annexation of integral parts of georgia 's internationally recognized territory , " georgia 's foreign ministry said in a statement . " we need serious actions , not only words from our partners in the next days and weeks , " said saakashvili , adding that he would be sending foreign minister david bakradze to the united states and euro-atlantic integration minister giorgi baramidze to germany and france to discuss the issue . georgia 's mission to the european union said baramidze had scheduled emergency meetings with nato ambassadors as well as with eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner for friday . russia 's decision has already elicited expressions of concern from the eu and a call from nato for moscow to reverse the measure . russian roulette bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili believes georgia 's sovereignty is in peril tbilisi was reacting to russia 's announcement wednesday that it would be stepping up cooperation with the two pro-moscow breakaway regions , abkhazia and south ossetia , in trade , culture and other areas . the move is intended to pave the way for " mechanisms for the complete protection of the rights , freedoms and legal interests " of russian citizens living in the regions , the russian foreign ministry said . the two regions broke away from georgian control during wars in the 1990s following the country 's independence , after the collapse of the soviet union . unwilling to lose influence in the strategic south caucasus region along its southern border , russia has backed abkhazia and south ossetia both financially and by providing russian citizenship to most of their residents . the nato factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 18-month separatist war between georgia and south ossetia ended in 1992 meanwhile , abkhazia 's self-appointed president sergei bagapsh said georgia was building up troops and artillery along the border and threatened to deploy abkhaz armed forces unless georgia withdrew by the end of friday . saakashvili has pledged to regain control over abkhazia and south ossetia and has long accused the kremlin of stirring up separatism . moscow insists it will stop short of recognizing the independence of the two provinces , a move which analysts say could boost separatist feeling in several russian regions . in fact , russia has increased its support for the separatists in response to western recognition of kosovo as an independent nation .
moscow opposed kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence from serbia in february . in bucharest earlier this month , nato promised that georgia would eventually be given membership in the alliance and cited the country 's fragmented status as one reason for denying georgia 's request to be put on a definite track for membership through nato 's membership action plan . according to the statement released by georgia 's foreign ministry thursday , russia 's actions are an attempt to " not allow georgia 's rapprochement with nato , something an absolute majority of georgian citizens ... firmly supports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.04.2008 opinion : denounce but do n't ban far-right npd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should denounce extremism but not ban the far-right npd , said parliamentarian hans-peter uhl .
on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .
when the group is mentioned , its platform should be denounced in the same breath .
the npd should in no way benefit from this short-sighted party conflict . hans-peter uhl is the domestic policy speaker for the cdu-csu faction in the german parliament . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .

reacting to food crisis in his speech , sarkozy also weighed into the debate over food prices , saying the current food crisis called not only for an immediate response but also for an ambitious strategy to support agriculture , and pledging to double france 's emergency food aid this year to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
" we can not remain indifferent to the unrest among those people who , in the developing countries , can no longer satisfy their hunger , " he said .

bush said on wednesday that he wanted us emissions to peak by 2025 , a measure dismissed as too little too late by the eu and germany , with german environment minister sigmar gabriel describing the plan as " neanderthal . "
the white house on thursday played down germany 's criticism .

fratto said climate change is such a contentious issue that it was no surprise that bush faced criticism over his proposal .
" slings and arrows would have been thrown no matter what we said , and that 's the nature of the debate on climate change , " fratto said .
" and you 're never going to make everyone happy on it . "
sarkozy refrained on friday from referring directly to the us feet-dragging , but his message was clear .

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .

israel should curb the fanaticism of jewish settlers , said the delegation . the german delegation reacted hesitantly to an apology issued by officials from the jewish settlement in the west bank city of hebron on thursday , april 17 . jerzy montag , a parliamentarian for the greens who had been in hebron the previous day with six other representatives from a german judicial committee , called the incident " completely unacceptable . " the committee members had said that israeli security forces were unwilling to intervene when hebron residents began hurling insults and threats at them and that their visit could not be continued . " it was certainly just a few of the residents who hindered our visit , " the parliamentarians said in a joint statement issued thursday . germans blamed for not seeking dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy montag said threats were directed at the german delegation david wilder , spokesman for the jewish community , said the people 's resentment was not directed at the german politicians but at their israeli guides , who were allegedly biased against the jewish settlers . montag disagreed , however , saying the insults and threats were indeed directed at the german delegation . wilder also accused the visitors of not seeking to engage in dialogue with the jewish community in hebron .
the 800-member community lives under military protection amidst more than 100,000 palestinians . " many of us lost german roots and family members during the holocaust , " said wilder .
" when germans come to hebron , they should at least meet with members of the community . " montag called this a " grotesque twisting of the truth . "
he said he was willing to talk with the settlers , but not after being insulted and threatened . in their statement , the judicial committee appealed to the israeli authorities " to curb the fanaticism of the jewish settlers .

on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .
when the group is mentioned , its platform should be denounced in the same breath .
the npd should in no way benefit from this short-sighted party conflict . hans-peter uhl is the domestic policy speaker for the cdu-csu faction in the german parliament . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we demand that russia stop all actions which breach georgia 's sovereignty , " the former soviet republic 's pro-western president , mikhail saakashvili , told ministers at a cabinet meeting , his press office said thursday , april 17 . " the russian federation has made yet another extremely dangerous step towards the de facto annexation of integral parts of georgia 's internationally recognized territory , " georgia 's foreign ministry said in a statement . " we need serious actions , not only words from our partners in the next days and weeks , " said saakashvili , adding that he would be sending foreign minister david bakradze to the united states and euro-atlantic integration minister giorgi baramidze to germany and france to discuss the issue . georgia 's mission to the european union said baramidze had scheduled emergency meetings with nato ambassadors as well as with eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner for friday . russia 's decision has already elicited expressions of concern from the eu and a call from nato for moscow to reverse the measure . russian roulette bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili believes georgia 's sovereignty is in peril tbilisi was reacting to russia 's announcement wednesday that it would be stepping up cooperation with the two pro-moscow breakaway regions , abkhazia and south ossetia , in trade , culture and other areas . the move is intended to pave the way for " mechanisms for the complete protection of the rights , freedoms and legal interests " of russian citizens living in the regions , the russian foreign ministry said . the two regions broke away from georgian control during wars in the 1990s following the country 's independence , after the collapse of the soviet union . unwilling to lose influence in the strategic south caucasus region along its southern border , russia has backed abkhazia and south ossetia both financially and by providing russian citizenship to most of their residents . the nato factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 18-month separatist war between georgia and south ossetia ended in 1992 meanwhile , abkhazia 's self-appointed president sergei bagapsh said georgia was building up troops and artillery along the border and threatened to deploy abkhaz armed forces unless georgia withdrew by the end of friday . saakashvili has pledged to regain control over abkhazia and south ossetia and has long accused the kremlin of stirring up separatism . moscow insists it will stop short of recognizing the independence of the two provinces , a move which analysts say could boost separatist feeling in several russian regions . in fact , russia has increased its support for the separatists in response to western recognition of kosovo as an independent nation .
moscow opposed kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence from serbia in february . in bucharest earlier this month , nato promised that georgia would eventually be given membership in the alliance and cited the country 's fragmented status as one reason for denying georgia 's request to be put on a definite track for membership through nato 's membership action plan . according to the statement released by georgia 's foreign ministry thursday , russia 's actions are an attempt to " not allow georgia 's rapprochement with nato , something an absolute majority of georgian citizens ... firmly supports .

" we demand that russia stop all actions which breach georgia 's sovereignty , " the former soviet republic 's pro-western president , mikhail saakashvili , told ministers at a cabinet meeting , his press office said thursday , april 17 . " the russian federation has made yet another extremely dangerous step towards the de facto annexation of integral parts of georgia 's internationally recognized territory , " georgia 's foreign ministry said in a statement . " we need serious actions , not only words from our partners in the next days and weeks , " said saakashvili , adding that he would be sending foreign minister david bakradze to the united states and euro-atlantic integration minister giorgi baramidze to germany and france to discuss the issue . georgia 's mission to the european union said baramidze had scheduled emergency meetings with nato ambassadors as well as with eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner for friday . russia 's decision has already elicited expressions of concern from the eu and a call from nato for moscow to reverse the measure . russian roulette bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili believes georgia 's sovereignty is in peril tbilisi was reacting to russia 's announcement wednesday that it would be stepping up cooperation with the two pro-moscow breakaway regions , abkhazia and south ossetia , in trade , culture and other areas . the move is intended to pave the way for " mechanisms for the complete protection of the rights , freedoms and legal interests " of russian citizens living in the regions , the russian foreign ministry said . the two regions broke away from georgian control during wars in the 1990s following the country 's independence , after the collapse of the soviet union . unwilling to lose influence in the strategic south caucasus region along its southern border , russia has backed abkhazia and south ossetia both financially and by providing russian citizenship to most of their residents . the nato factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 18-month separatist war between georgia and south ossetia ended in 1992 meanwhile , abkhazia 's self-appointed president sergei bagapsh said georgia was building up troops and artillery along the border and threatened to deploy abkhaz armed forces unless georgia withdrew by the end of friday . saakashvili has pledged to regain control over abkhazia and south ossetia and has long accused the kremlin of stirring up separatism . moscow insists it will stop short of recognizing the independence of the two provinces , a move which analysts say could boost separatist feeling in several russian regions . in fact , russia has increased its support for the separatists in response to western recognition of kosovo as an independent nation .
moscow opposed kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence from serbia in february . in bucharest earlier this month , nato promised that georgia would eventually be given membership in the alliance and cited the country 's fragmented status as one reason for denying georgia 's request to be put on a definite track for membership through nato 's membership action plan . according to the statement released by georgia 's foreign ministry thursday , russia 's actions are an attempt to " not allow georgia 's rapprochement with nato , something an absolute majority of georgian citizens ... firmly supports .

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .
climate change as a trigger of conflict the event which took place is this week was the third in the mem series first launched in september 2007 .
its stated goal was to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen conference and draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" climate change is already having a considerable impact on security , " sarkozy said in his speech to ministers from the 16 economies that together account for 80 percent of the planet 's greenhouse-gas emissions - including australia , brazil , britain , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , south korea , mexico , russia , south africa and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did climate change contribute to the darfur crisis ?
" water scarcity and rivalry for farmland and fishing resources were emerging as " major challenges , " he said , pointing to the african example .
" in darfur , we see this explosive mixture from the impact of climate change , which prompts immigration by increasingly impoverished people , which then has consequences in war . "
" if we keep going down this path , climate change will encourage the immigration of people with nothing towards areas where the population do have something , and the darfur crisis will be only one crisis among dozens of others , " he stressed .
un secretary general ban ki-moon last june was the first to suggest that the darfur conflict arose " at least in part " from climate change .
reacting to food crisis in his speech , sarkozy also weighed into the debate over food prices , saying the current food crisis called not only for an immediate response but also for an ambitious strategy to support agriculture , and pledging to double france 's emergency food aid this year to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
" we can not remain indifferent to the unrest among those people who , in the developing countries , can no longer satisfy their hunger , " he said .
soaring prices for basic grains such as rice , wheat , soybean and corn , have provoked protests and rioting in at least half a dozen developing countries in past months , reports afp .

bush said on wednesday that he wanted us emissions to peak by 2025 , a measure dismissed as too little too late by the eu and germany , with german environment minister sigmar gabriel describing the plan as " neanderthal . "
the white house on thursday played down germany 's criticism .
" you 're always going to see lots of hot-blooded reaction to anything said on climate , and so you should just be prepared for that , " said tony fratto , a white house spokesman .
fratto said climate change is such a contentious issue that it was no surprise that bush faced criticism over his proposal .
" slings and arrows would have been thrown no matter what we said , and that 's the nature of the debate on climate change , " fratto said .
" and you 're never going to make everyone happy on it . "
sarkozy refrained on friday from referring directly to the us feet-dragging , but his message was clear .

israel should curb the fanaticism of jewish settlers , said the delegation . the german delegation reacted hesitantly to an apology issued by officials from the jewish settlement in the west bank city of hebron on thursday , april 17 . jerzy montag , a parliamentarian for the greens who had been in hebron the previous day with six other representatives from a german judicial committee , called the incident " completely unacceptable .

it 's just as well he was wrong . after news of this david and goliath tale spread around the world , nasa brought the international media back to earth with a bump on wednesday when it issued a statement says the whiz kid was wrong .
the agency said its figures are correct when it comes to the asteroid apophis , not the boy 's .
" we stand by our numbers , " nasa spokesman dwayne brown told afp .
stars in his eyes the agency that oversees space shuttle missions and unmanned space probes made its comments after the german newspaper potsdamer neuester nachrichten reported on tuesday that supremely self-confident local teenager nico marquardt had calculated there was a 1 in 450 chance that the apophis asteroid will collide with earth .
in a project for a regional science competition , marquardt set out to demonstrate that scientists at nasa had got it wrong when they estimated the chances of a collision at only 1 in 45,000 .
he might have slipped up , but the junior astronomer certainly had some of the world 's finest scientific minds worried there .

the student 's estimates were reportedly based on the asteroid hitting a satellite in 2029 .

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .
climate change as a trigger of conflict the event which took place is this week was the third in the mem series first launched in september 2007 .
its stated goal was to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen conference and draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" climate change is already having a considerable impact on security , " sarkozy said in his speech to ministers from the 16 economies that together account for 80 percent of the planet 's greenhouse-gas emissions - including australia , brazil , britain , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , south korea , mexico , russia , south africa and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did climate change contribute to the darfur crisis ?
" water scarcity and rivalry for farmland and fishing resources were emerging as " major challenges , " he said , pointing to the african example .
" in darfur , we see this explosive mixture from the impact of climate change , which prompts immigration by increasingly impoverished people , which then has consequences in war . "
" if we keep going down this path , climate change will encourage the immigration of people with nothing towards areas where the population do have something , and the darfur crisis will be only one crisis among dozens of others , " he stressed .
un secretary general ban ki-moon last june was the first to suggest that the darfur conflict arose " at least in part " from climate change .
reacting to food crisis in his speech , sarkozy also weighed into the debate over food prices , saying the current food crisis called not only for an immediate response but also for an ambitious strategy to support agriculture , and pledging to double france 's emergency food aid this year to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
" we can not remain indifferent to the unrest among those people who , in the developing countries , can no longer satisfy their hunger , " he said .
soaring prices for basic grains such as rice , wheat , soybean and corn , have provoked protests and rioting in at least half a dozen developing countries in past months , reports afp .
experts have pinpointed climate change as a factor here too , arguing that rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns may be contributing to water scarcity .

bush said on wednesday that he wanted us emissions to peak by 2025 , a measure dismissed as too little too late by the eu and germany , with german environment minister sigmar gabriel describing the plan as " neanderthal . "
the white house on thursday played down germany 's criticism .
" you 're always going to see lots of hot-blooded reaction to anything said on climate , and so you should just be prepared for that , " said tony fratto , a white house spokesman .
fratto said climate change is such a contentious issue that it was no surprise that bush faced criticism over his proposal .
" slings and arrows would have been thrown no matter what we said , and that 's the nature of the debate on climate change , " fratto said .
" and you 're never going to make everyone happy on it . "
sarkozy refrained on friday from referring directly to the us feet-dragging , but his message was clear .
" we can not afford the luxury that one of you remains behind by the roadside because the whole planet needs every one of you , " he said .

it 's just as well he was wrong . after news of this david and goliath tale spread around the world , nasa brought the international media back to earth with a bump on wednesday when it issued a statement says the whiz kid was wrong .
the agency said its figures are correct when it comes to the asteroid apophis , not the boy 's .
" we stand by our numbers , " nasa spokesman dwayne brown told afp .
stars in his eyes the agency that oversees space shuttle missions and unmanned space probes made its comments after the german newspaper potsdamer neuester nachrichten reported on tuesday that supremely self-confident local teenager nico marquardt had calculated there was a 1 in 450 chance that the apophis asteroid will collide with earth .
in a project for a regional science competition , marquardt set out to demonstrate that scientists at nasa had got it wrong when they estimated the chances of a collision at only 1 in 45,000 .
he might have slipped up , but the junior astronomer certainly had some of the world 's finest scientific minds worried there .
protesting too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not doomsday just yet experts at the agency 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california , insist they never had any doubts about their calculations , brown said .
the near-earth object program office " has not changed its current estimates for the very low probability -lrb- 1 in 45,000 -rrb- of an earth impact by the asteroid apophis in 2036 , " brown said in a statement .
the student 's estimates were reportedly based on the asteroid hitting a satellite in 2029 .
" however , the asteroid will not pass near the main belt of geosynchronous satellites in 2029 , and the chance of a collision with a satellite is exceedingly remote , " said the statement . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .
climate change as a trigger of conflict the event which took place is this week was the third in the mem series first launched in september 2007 .
its stated goal was to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen conference and draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" climate change is already having a considerable impact on security , " sarkozy said in his speech to ministers from the 16 economies that together account for 80 percent of the planet 's greenhouse-gas emissions - including australia , brazil , britain , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , south korea , mexico , russia , south africa and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did climate change contribute to the darfur crisis ?
" water scarcity and rivalry for farmland and fishing resources were emerging as " major challenges , " he said , pointing to the african example .
" in darfur , we see this explosive mixture from the impact of climate change , which prompts immigration by increasingly impoverished people , which then has consequences in war . "
" if we keep going down this path , climate change will encourage the immigration of people with nothing towards areas where the population do have something , and the darfur crisis will be only one crisis among dozens of others , " he stressed .
un secretary general ban ki-moon last june was the first to suggest that the darfur conflict arose " at least in part " from climate change .
reacting to food crisis in his speech , sarkozy also weighed into the debate over food prices , saying the current food crisis called not only for an immediate response but also for an ambitious strategy to support agriculture , and pledging to double france 's emergency food aid this year to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
" we can not remain indifferent to the unrest among those people who , in the developing countries , can no longer satisfy their hunger , " he said .
soaring prices for basic grains such as rice , wheat , soybean and corn , have provoked protests and rioting in at least half a dozen developing countries in past months , reports afp .
experts have pinpointed climate change as a factor here too , arguing that rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns may be contributing to water scarcity .
biofuels , championed to help reduce carbon emissions and ease dependence on fossil fuels , have also started to become contentious .
with programs such as those in the us and brazil converting grains , sugar and soy beans into ethanol and biodiesel , the boom in biofuels has become key to the food crisis .
bush-bashing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush 's environment policies have been described as " neanderthal " tempers had flared at the meeting on thursday when criticism was leveled at us president george w. bush 's new climate plan .
bush said on wednesday that he wanted us emissions to peak by 2025 , a measure dismissed as too little too late by the eu and germany , with german environment minister sigmar gabriel describing the plan as " neanderthal . "
the white house on thursday played down germany 's criticism .
" you 're always going to see lots of hot-blooded reaction to anything said on climate , and so you should just be prepared for that , " said tony fratto , a white house spokesman .
fratto said climate change is such a contentious issue that it was no surprise that bush faced criticism over his proposal .
" slings and arrows would have been thrown no matter what we said , and that 's the nature of the debate on climate change , " fratto said .
" and you 're never going to make everyone happy on it . "
sarkozy refrained on friday from referring directly to the us feet-dragging , but his message was clear .
" we can not afford the luxury that one of you remains behind by the roadside because the whole planet needs every one of you , " he said .
" i would like to pass on a simple message to you : the situation is urgent . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israel should curb the fanaticism of jewish settlers , said the delegation . the german delegation reacted hesitantly to an apology issued by officials from the jewish settlement in the west bank city of hebron on thursday , april 17 . jerzy montag , a parliamentarian for the greens who had been in hebron the previous day with six other representatives from a german judicial committee , called the incident " completely unacceptable . " the committee members had said that israeli security forces were unwilling to intervene when hebron residents began hurling insults and threats at them and that their visit could not be continued . " it was certainly just a few of the residents who hindered our visit , " the parliamentarians said in a joint statement issued thursday . germans blamed for not seeking dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy montag said threats were directed at the german delegation david wilder , spokesman for the jewish community , said the people 's resentment was not directed at the german politicians but at their israeli guides , who were allegedly biased against the jewish settlers . montag disagreed , however , saying the insults and threats were indeed directed at the german delegation . wilder also accused the visitors of not seeking to engage in dialogue with the jewish community in hebron .
the 800-member community lives under military protection amidst more than 100,000 palestinians . " many of us lost german roots and family members during the holocaust , " said wilder .
" when germans come to hebron , they should at least meet with members of the community . " montag called this a " grotesque twisting of the truth . "
he said he was willing to talk with the settlers , but not after being insulted and threatened . in their statement , the judicial committee appealed to the israeli authorities " to curb the fanaticism of the jewish settlers .

" we demand that russia stop all actions which breach georgia 's sovereignty , " the former soviet republic 's pro-western president , mikhail saakashvili , told ministers at a cabinet meeting , his press office said thursday , april 17 .

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .
climate change as a trigger of conflict the event which took place is this week was the third in the mem series first launched in september 2007 .
its stated goal was to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen conference and draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" climate change is already having a considerable impact on security , " sarkozy said in his speech to ministers from the 16 economies that together account for 80 percent of the planet 's greenhouse-gas emissions - including australia , brazil , britain , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , south korea , mexico , russia , south africa and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did climate change contribute to the darfur crisis ?
" water scarcity and rivalry for farmland and fishing resources were emerging as " major challenges , " he said , pointing to the african example .
" in darfur , we see this explosive mixture from the impact of climate change , which prompts immigration by increasingly impoverished people , which then has consequences in war . "
" if we keep going down this path , climate change will encourage the immigration of people with nothing towards areas where the population do have something , and the darfur crisis will be only one crisis among dozens of others , " he stressed .
un secretary general ban ki-moon last june was the first to suggest that the darfur conflict arose " at least in part " from climate change .
reacting to food crisis in his speech , sarkozy also weighed into the debate over food prices , saying the current food crisis called not only for an immediate response but also for an ambitious strategy to support agriculture , and pledging to double france 's emergency food aid this year to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
" we can not remain indifferent to the unrest among those people who , in the developing countries , can no longer satisfy their hunger , " he said .
soaring prices for basic grains such as rice , wheat , soybean and corn , have provoked protests and rioting in at least half a dozen developing countries in past months , reports afp .
experts have pinpointed climate change as a factor here too , arguing that rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns may be contributing to water scarcity .
biofuels , championed to help reduce carbon emissions and ease dependence on fossil fuels , have also started to become contentious .
with programs such as those in the us and brazil converting grains , sugar and soy beans into ethanol and biodiesel , the boom in biofuels has become key to the food crisis .

bush said on wednesday that he wanted us emissions to peak by 2025 , a measure dismissed as too little too late by the eu and germany , with german environment minister sigmar gabriel describing the plan as " neanderthal . "
the white house on thursday played down germany 's criticism .
" you 're always going to see lots of hot-blooded reaction to anything said on climate , and so you should just be prepared for that , " said tony fratto , a white house spokesman .
fratto said climate change is such a contentious issue that it was no surprise that bush faced criticism over his proposal .
" slings and arrows would have been thrown no matter what we said , and that 's the nature of the debate on climate change , " fratto said .
" and you 're never going to make everyone happy on it . "
sarkozy refrained on friday from referring directly to the us feet-dragging , but his message was clear .

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .
climate change as a trigger of conflict the event which took place is this week was the third in the mem series first launched in september 2007 .
its stated goal was to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen conference and draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" climate change is already having a considerable impact on security , " sarkozy said in his speech to ministers from the 16 economies that together account for 80 percent of the planet 's greenhouse-gas emissions - including australia , brazil , britain , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , south korea , mexico , russia , south africa and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did climate change contribute to the darfur crisis ?
" water scarcity and rivalry for farmland and fishing resources were emerging as " major challenges , " he said , pointing to the african example .
" in darfur , we see this explosive mixture from the impact of climate change , which prompts immigration by increasingly impoverished people , which then has consequences in war . "
" if we keep going down this path , climate change will encourage the immigration of people with nothing towards areas where the population do have something , and the darfur crisis will be only one crisis among dozens of others , " he stressed .
un secretary general ban ki-moon last june was the first to suggest that the darfur conflict arose " at least in part " from climate change .
reacting to food crisis in his speech , sarkozy also weighed into the debate over food prices , saying the current food crisis called not only for an immediate response but also for an ambitious strategy to support agriculture , and pledging to double france 's emergency food aid this year to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
" we can not remain indifferent to the unrest among those people who , in the developing countries , can no longer satisfy their hunger , " he said .
soaring prices for basic grains such as rice , wheat , soybean and corn , have provoked protests and rioting in at least half a dozen developing countries in past months , reports afp .
experts have pinpointed climate change as a factor here too , arguing that rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns may be contributing to water scarcity .
biofuels , championed to help reduce carbon emissions and ease dependence on fossil fuels , have also started to become contentious .
with programs such as those in the us and brazil converting grains , sugar and soy beans into ethanol and biodiesel , the boom in biofuels has become key to the food crisis .
bush-bashing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush 's environment policies have been described as " neanderthal " tempers had flared at the meeting on thursday when criticism was leveled at us president george w. bush 's new climate plan .
bush said on wednesday that he wanted us emissions to peak by 2025 , a measure dismissed as too little too late by the eu and germany , with german environment minister sigmar gabriel describing the plan as " neanderthal . "
the white house on thursday played down germany 's criticism .
" you 're always going to see lots of hot-blooded reaction to anything said on climate , and so you should just be prepared for that , " said tony fratto , a white house spokesman .
fratto said climate change is such a contentious issue that it was no surprise that bush faced criticism over his proposal .
" slings and arrows would have been thrown no matter what we said , and that 's the nature of the debate on climate change , " fratto said .
" and you 're never going to make everyone happy on it . "
sarkozy refrained on friday from referring directly to the us feet-dragging , but his message was clear .

on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .
when the group is mentioned , its platform should be denounced in the same breath .
the npd should in no way benefit from this short-sighted party conflict . hans-peter uhl is the domestic policy speaker for the cdu-csu faction in the german parliament . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israel should curb the fanaticism of jewish settlers , said the delegation . the german delegation reacted hesitantly to an apology issued by officials from the jewish settlement in the west bank city of hebron on thursday , april 17 . jerzy montag , a parliamentarian for the greens who had been in hebron the previous day with six other representatives from a german judicial committee , called the incident " completely unacceptable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.04.2008 opinion : denounce but do n't ban far-right npd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should denounce extremism but not ban the far-right npd , said parliamentarian hans-peter uhl .
on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .
when the group is mentioned , its platform should be denounced in the same breath .
the npd should in no way benefit from this short-sighted party conflict . hans-peter uhl is the domestic policy speaker for the cdu-csu faction in the german parliament . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .
when the group is mentioned , its platform should be denounced in the same breath .
the npd should in no way benefit from this short-sighted party conflict . hans-peter uhl is the domestic policy speaker for the cdu-csu faction in the german parliament . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think the right of asylum should be provided without consideration of religion or race , " said slovenian interior minsiter dragutin mate upon his arrival at a meeting of his eu counterparts in luxembourg on friday , april 18 . " it seems to me to be difficult to operate in this sense " of preferential treatment , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is concerned about the situation of iraqi christians german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had been given the green light from the country 's 16 top state security officials to start an eu initiative for the acceptance of iraqi christians as refugees at the meeting in luxembourg . he said an improvement to the situation of iraqi christians was " desperately necessary . " no details of schaeuble 's plans were made public , nor was it clear how many refugees germany would accept , although german press reports have said that the conservatives ' plan would allow for for 30,000 iraqi christians to be sheltered in the country . the social democrats - merkel 's partners in her ruling coalition - said they gave their backing to the proposal but were also uncomfortable with the decision to focus on christians . a difficult path bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- left -rrb- was somewhat reserved about the proposal justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , warned that there could be legal obstacles to singling out a religious group for help . " it 's a difficult path when you start saying that we 're accepting somebody because of their religious conviction , " she said . berlin interior minister erhart koerting , also of the spd , cautioned against focusing exclusively on christians and suggested adopting a broader approach .

it 's just as well he was wrong . after news of this david and goliath tale spread around the world , nasa brought the international media back to earth with a bump on wednesday when it issued a statement says the whiz kid was wrong .
the agency said its figures are correct when it comes to the asteroid apophis , not the boy 's .
" we stand by our numbers , " nasa spokesman dwayne brown told afp .
stars in his eyes the agency that oversees space shuttle missions and unmanned space probes made its comments after the german newspaper potsdamer neuester nachrichten reported on tuesday that supremely self-confident local teenager nico marquardt had calculated there was a 1 in 450 chance that the apophis asteroid will collide with earth .
in a project for a regional science competition , marquardt set out to demonstrate that scientists at nasa had got it wrong when they estimated the chances of a collision at only 1 in 45,000 .
he might have slipped up , but the junior astronomer certainly had some of the world 's finest scientific minds worried there .
protesting too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not doomsday just yet experts at the agency 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california , insist they never had any doubts about their calculations , brown said .
the near-earth object program office " has not changed its current estimates for the very low probability -lrb- 1 in 45,000 -rrb- of an earth impact by the asteroid apophis in 2036 , " brown said in a statement .
the student 's estimates were reportedly based on the asteroid hitting a satellite in 2029 .
" however , the asteroid will not pass near the main belt of geosynchronous satellites in 2029 , and the chance of a collision with a satellite is exceedingly remote , " said the statement . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .
when the group is mentioned , its platform should be denounced in the same breath .
the npd should in no way benefit from this short-sighted party conflict . hans-peter uhl is the domestic policy speaker for the cdu-csu faction in the german parliament . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .
climate change as a trigger of conflict the event which took place is this week was the third in the mem series first launched in september 2007 .
its stated goal was to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen conference and draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" climate change is already having a considerable impact on security , " sarkozy said in his speech to ministers from the 16 economies that together account for 80 percent of the planet 's greenhouse-gas emissions - including australia , brazil , britain , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , south korea , mexico , russia , south africa and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did climate change contribute to the darfur crisis ?
" water scarcity and rivalry for farmland and fishing resources were emerging as " major challenges , " he said , pointing to the african example .
" in darfur , we see this explosive mixture from the impact of climate change , which prompts immigration by increasingly impoverished people , which then has consequences in war . "
" if we keep going down this path , climate change will encourage the immigration of people with nothing towards areas where the population do have something , and the darfur crisis will be only one crisis among dozens of others , " he stressed .
un secretary general ban ki-moon last june was the first to suggest that the darfur conflict arose " at least in part " from climate change .
reacting to food crisis in his speech , sarkozy also weighed into the debate over food prices , saying the current food crisis called not only for an immediate response but also for an ambitious strategy to support agriculture , and pledging to double france 's emergency food aid this year to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
" we can not remain indifferent to the unrest among those people who , in the developing countries , can no longer satisfy their hunger , " he said .
soaring prices for basic grains such as rice , wheat , soybean and corn , have provoked protests and rioting in at least half a dozen developing countries in past months , reports afp .
experts have pinpointed climate change as a factor here too , arguing that rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns may be contributing to water scarcity .
biofuels , championed to help reduce carbon emissions and ease dependence on fossil fuels , have also started to become contentious .
with programs such as those in the us and brazil converting grains , sugar and soy beans into ethanol and biodiesel , the boom in biofuels has become key to the food crisis .

bush said on wednesday that he wanted us emissions to peak by 2025 , a measure dismissed as too little too late by the eu and germany , with german environment minister sigmar gabriel describing the plan as " neanderthal . "

fratto said climate change is such a contentious issue that it was no surprise that bush faced criticism over his proposal .
" slings and arrows would have been thrown no matter what we said , and that 's the nature of the debate on climate change , " fratto said .
" and you 're never going to make everyone happy on it . "
sarkozy refrained on friday from referring directly to the us feet-dragging , but his message was clear .

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .
climate change as a trigger of conflict the event which took place is this week was the third in the mem series first launched in september 2007 .
its stated goal was to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen conference and draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" climate change is already having a considerable impact on security , " sarkozy said in his speech to ministers from the 16 economies that together account for 80 percent of the planet 's greenhouse-gas emissions - including australia , brazil , britain , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , south korea , mexico , russia , south africa and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did climate change contribute to the darfur crisis ?
" water scarcity and rivalry for farmland and fishing resources were emerging as " major challenges , " he said , pointing to the african example .
" in darfur , we see this explosive mixture from the impact of climate change , which prompts immigration by increasingly impoverished people , which then has consequences in war . "
" if we keep going down this path , climate change will encourage the immigration of people with nothing towards areas where the population do have something , and the darfur crisis will be only one crisis among dozens of others , " he stressed .
un secretary general ban ki-moon last june was the first to suggest that the darfur conflict arose " at least in part " from climate change .
reacting to food crisis in his speech , sarkozy also weighed into the debate over food prices , saying the current food crisis called not only for an immediate response but also for an ambitious strategy to support agriculture , and pledging to double france 's emergency food aid this year to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
" we can not remain indifferent to the unrest among those people who , in the developing countries , can no longer satisfy their hunger , " he said .
soaring prices for basic grains such as rice , wheat , soybean and corn , have provoked protests and rioting in at least half a dozen developing countries in past months , reports afp .
experts have pinpointed climate change as a factor here too , arguing that rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns may be contributing to water scarcity .
biofuels , championed to help reduce carbon emissions and ease dependence on fossil fuels , have also started to become contentious .
with programs such as those in the us and brazil converting grains , sugar and soy beans into ethanol and biodiesel , the boom in biofuels has become key to the food crisis .

bush said on wednesday that he wanted us emissions to peak by 2025 , a measure dismissed as too little too late by the eu and germany , with german environment minister sigmar gabriel describing the plan as " neanderthal . "
the white house on thursday played down germany 's criticism .
" you 're always going to see lots of hot-blooded reaction to anything said on climate , and so you should just be prepared for that , " said tony fratto , a white house spokesman .
fratto said climate change is such a contentious issue that it was no surprise that bush faced criticism over his proposal .
" slings and arrows would have been thrown no matter what we said , and that 's the nature of the debate on climate change , " fratto said .
" and you 're never going to make everyone happy on it . "
sarkozy refrained on friday from referring directly to the us feet-dragging , but his message was clear .
" we can not afford the luxury that one of you remains behind by the roadside because the whole planet needs every one of you , " he said .

but this development is being driven by what experts say is a " worrying " explosion in the low-wage sector . over the past 10 years , the number of people considered to be low-wage earners in germany increased from 15 to 22 percent , reaching a total of 6.5 million people , a new study has found .
one in five germans today works in the " low-wage " sector and , as of last year , some 200,000 employed people resort to taking an additional " mini-job " to make ends meet .
" the conclusions for germany are worrying , " said gerhard bosch of the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for work , skills and training -lrb- iaq -rrb- , which carried out research for the study in britain , denmark , france , germany , the netherlands and the us .
the development is in part due to the german government , which has intentionally been expanding the low-wage sector in recent years in order to bring down the country 's high unemployment levels .
a general shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the boom in low-wage jobs , the middle class is in danger of eroding but bosch 's colleague at the iaq , dorothea voss-dahm , told dw-world.de that a general shift in society is also to blame .
" for so many years , we 've heard that germany is inflexible in its labor laws , " she said .
" now , companies and employee associations are saying , let 's try something different . "
the low-wage explosion could not have happened without the introduction in 2003 of the so-called " mini-job " in germany .
under the scheme , employees can earn 400 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- month and are exempt from paying tax and social insurance contributions .
but according to voss-dahm , employers have seized on mini-jobs as a way to push wage levels down , with the result that the wage gap is widening , and germany 's middle class shrinking .
" if the middle class erodes , then over the long term , our whole society will change , " voss-dahm said .
" the middle class is the layer upon which our society was built . "
authors surprised by unflattering picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans are learning what it feels like to be " poor despite employment " the study on low-wage sectors in europe and the us showed that , with 22 percent of the workforce considered low-wage earners , germany has already eclipsed britain -lrb- 21.7 percent -rrb- and is catching up with the us -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- .
" if the government does n't do anything to turn this around , germany 's low-wage sector could become larger than that of the us , where every fourth person is a low-wage earner , " american economist robert solow told the frankfurter rundschau .
the authors of the german study admitted that they had n't expected " such unflattering results . "
in comparison with the us , low-wage earners in germany are still better off , as the social net ensures they have health insurance , paid vacation and generous pension benefits .
but the idea that germany 's economy is bolstered by low-wage jobs and people who have to work several jobs just to survive is new .
" in germany , we 've only just begun to realize that poverty could become a problem , " said the iaq 's voss-dahm .

but this development is being driven by what experts say is a " worrying " explosion in the low-wage sector . over the past 10 years , the number of people considered to be low-wage earners in germany increased from 15 to 22 percent , reaching a total of 6.5 million people , a new study has found .
one in five germans today works in the " low-wage " sector and , as of last year , some 200,000 employed people resort to taking an additional " mini-job " to make ends meet .
" the conclusions for germany are worrying , " said gerhard bosch of the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for work , skills and training -lrb- iaq -rrb- , which carried out research for the study in britain , denmark , france , germany , the netherlands and the us .
the development is in part due to the german government , which has intentionally been expanding the low-wage sector in recent years in order to bring down the country 's high unemployment levels .
a general shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the boom in low-wage jobs , the middle class is in danger of eroding but bosch 's colleague at the iaq , dorothea voss-dahm , told dw-world.de that a general shift in society is also to blame .
" for so many years , we 've heard that germany is inflexible in its labor laws , " she said .
" now , companies and employee associations are saying , let 's try something different . "
the low-wage explosion could not have happened without the introduction in 2003 of the so-called " mini-job " in germany .
under the scheme , employees can earn 400 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- month and are exempt from paying tax and social insurance contributions .
but according to voss-dahm , employers have seized on mini-jobs as a way to push wage levels down , with the result that the wage gap is widening , and germany 's middle class shrinking .
" if the middle class erodes , then over the long term , our whole society will change , " voss-dahm said .
" the middle class is the layer upon which our society was built . "
authors surprised by unflattering picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans are learning what it feels like to be " poor despite employment " the study on low-wage sectors in europe and the us showed that , with 22 percent of the workforce considered low-wage earners , germany has already eclipsed britain -lrb- 21.7 percent -rrb- and is catching up with the us -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- .
" if the government does n't do anything to turn this around , germany 's low-wage sector could become larger than that of the us , where every fourth person is a low-wage earner , " american economist robert solow told the frankfurter rundschau .
the authors of the german study admitted that they had n't expected " such unflattering results . "
in comparison with the us , low-wage earners in germany are still better off , as the social net ensures they have health insurance , paid vacation and generous pension benefits .
but the idea that germany 's economy is bolstered by low-wage jobs and people who have to work several jobs just to survive is new .
" in germany , we 've only just begun to realize that poverty could become a problem , " said the iaq 's voss-dahm .
she said the government could take two corrective steps : abolish the mini-job regulations , which would remove the incentive for companies to lower wages ; and introduce a minimum wage which would ensure that even those in lower paying jobs can still make ends meet . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think the right of asylum should be provided without consideration of religion or race , " said slovenian interior minsiter dragutin mate upon his arrival at a meeting of his eu counterparts in luxembourg on friday , april 18 . " it seems to me to be difficult to operate in this sense " of preferential treatment , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is concerned about the situation of iraqi christians german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had been given the green light from the country 's 16 top state security officials to start an eu initiative for the acceptance of iraqi christians as refugees at the meeting in luxembourg . he said an improvement to the situation of iraqi christians was " desperately necessary . " no details of schaeuble 's plans were made public , nor was it clear how many refugees germany would accept , although german press reports have said that the conservatives ' plan would allow for for 30,000 iraqi christians to be sheltered in the country . the social democrats - merkel 's partners in her ruling coalition - said they gave their backing to the proposal but were also uncomfortable with the decision to focus on christians . a difficult path bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- left -rrb- was somewhat reserved about the proposal justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , warned that there could be legal obstacles to singling out a religious group for help . " it 's a difficult path when you start saying that we 're accepting somebody because of their religious conviction , " she said . berlin interior minister erhart koerting , also of the spd , cautioned against focusing exclusively on christians and suggested adopting a broader approach . " we decided to give schaeuble 's party carte blanche but for my part this does not mean explicitly that it only has to be aimed at christians , " koerting said .

it 's just as well he was wrong . after news of this david and goliath tale spread around the world , nasa brought the international media back to earth with a bump on wednesday when it issued a statement says the whiz kid was wrong .
the agency said its figures are correct when it comes to the asteroid apophis , not the boy 's .
" we stand by our numbers , " nasa spokesman dwayne brown told afp .
stars in his eyes the agency that oversees space shuttle missions and unmanned space probes made its comments after the german newspaper potsdamer neuester nachrichten reported on tuesday that supremely self-confident local teenager nico marquardt had calculated there was a 1 in 450 chance that the apophis asteroid will collide with earth .
in a project for a regional science competition , marquardt set out to demonstrate that scientists at nasa had got it wrong when they estimated the chances of a collision at only 1 in 45,000 .
he might have slipped up , but the junior astronomer certainly had some of the world 's finest scientific minds worried there .
protesting too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not doomsday just yet experts at the agency 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california , insist they never had any doubts about their calculations , brown said .
the near-earth object program office " has not changed its current estimates for the very low probability -lrb- 1 in 45,000 -rrb- of an earth impact by the asteroid apophis in 2036 , " brown said in a statement .
the student 's estimates were reportedly based on the asteroid hitting a satellite in 2029 .
" however , the asteroid will not pass near the main belt of geosynchronous satellites in 2029 , and the chance of a collision with a satellite is exceedingly remote , " said the statement . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's just as well he was wrong . after news of this david and goliath tale spread around the world , nasa brought the international media back to earth with a bump on wednesday when it issued a statement says the whiz kid was wrong .
the agency said its figures are correct when it comes to the asteroid apophis , not the boy 's .
" we stand by our numbers , " nasa spokesman dwayne brown told afp .
stars in his eyes the agency that oversees space shuttle missions and unmanned space probes made its comments after the german newspaper potsdamer neuester nachrichten reported on tuesday that supremely self-confident local teenager nico marquardt had calculated there was a 1 in 450 chance that the apophis asteroid will collide with earth .
in a project for a regional science competition , marquardt set out to demonstrate that scientists at nasa had got it wrong when they estimated the chances of a collision at only 1 in 45,000 .
he might have slipped up , but the junior astronomer certainly had some of the world 's finest scientific minds worried there .
protesting too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not doomsday just yet experts at the agency 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california , insist they never had any doubts about their calculations , brown said .
the near-earth object program office " has not changed its current estimates for the very low probability -lrb- 1 in 45,000 -rrb- of an earth impact by the asteroid apophis in 2036 , " brown said in a statement .
the student 's estimates were reportedly based on the asteroid hitting a satellite in 2029 .
" however , the asteroid will not pass near the main belt of geosynchronous satellites in 2029 , and the chance of a collision with a satellite is exceedingly remote , " said the statement . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .
climate change as a trigger of conflict the event which took place is this week was the third in the mem series first launched in september 2007 .
its stated goal was to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen conference and draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" climate change is already having a considerable impact on security , " sarkozy said in his speech to ministers from the 16 economies that together account for 80 percent of the planet 's greenhouse-gas emissions - including australia , brazil , britain , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , south korea , mexico , russia , south africa and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did climate change contribute to the darfur crisis ?
" water scarcity and rivalry for farmland and fishing resources were emerging as " major challenges , " he said , pointing to the african example .
" in darfur , we see this explosive mixture from the impact of climate change , which prompts immigration by increasingly impoverished people , which then has consequences in war . "
" if we keep going down this path , climate change will encourage the immigration of people with nothing towards areas where the population do have something , and the darfur crisis will be only one crisis among dozens of others , " he stressed .
un secretary general ban ki-moon last june was the first to suggest that the darfur conflict arose " at least in part " from climate change .
reacting to food crisis in his speech , sarkozy also weighed into the debate over food prices , saying the current food crisis called not only for an immediate response but also for an ambitious strategy to support agriculture , and pledging to double france 's emergency food aid this year to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
" we can not remain indifferent to the unrest among those people who , in the developing countries , can no longer satisfy their hunger , " he said .
soaring prices for basic grains such as rice , wheat , soybean and corn , have provoked protests and rioting in at least half a dozen developing countries in past months , reports afp .
experts have pinpointed climate change as a factor here too , arguing that rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns may be contributing to water scarcity .
biofuels , championed to help reduce carbon emissions and ease dependence on fossil fuels , have also started to become contentious .
with programs such as those in the us and brazil converting grains , sugar and soy beans into ethanol and biodiesel , the boom in biofuels has become key to the food crisis .
bush-bashing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush 's environment policies have been described as " neanderthal " tempers had flared at the meeting on thursday when criticism was leveled at us president george w. bush 's new climate plan .
bush said on wednesday that he wanted us emissions to peak by 2025 , a measure dismissed as too little too late by the eu and germany , with german environment minister sigmar gabriel describing the plan as " neanderthal . "
the white house on thursday played down germany 's criticism .
" you 're always going to see lots of hot-blooded reaction to anything said on climate , and so you should just be prepared for that , " said tony fratto , a white house spokesman .
fratto said climate change is such a contentious issue that it was no surprise that bush faced criticism over his proposal .
" slings and arrows would have been thrown no matter what we said , and that 's the nature of the debate on climate change , " fratto said .
" and you 're never going to make everyone happy on it . "
sarkozy refrained on friday from referring directly to the us feet-dragging , but his message was clear .
" we can not afford the luxury that one of you remains behind by the roadside because the whole planet needs every one of you , " he said .
" i would like to pass on a simple message to you : the situation is urgent . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.04.2008 opinion : denounce but do n't ban far-right npd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should denounce extremism but not ban the far-right npd , said parliamentarian hans-peter uhl .
on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .
when the group is mentioned , its platform should be denounced in the same breath .
the npd should in no way benefit from this short-sighted party conflict . hans-peter uhl is the domestic policy speaker for the cdu-csu faction in the german parliament . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the longest serving member of germany 's government , who has been in office since 1998 , she is now taking on an honorary job for the united nations .
as the un 's special envoy , wieczorek-zeul - together with south african finance minister trevor manuel - is organizing the international conference on financing for development , which will take place in doha , qatar , from nov .
29 to dec .
2 .
the meeting is expected to focus on taking stock of current development cooperation and come up with binding assurances for the future , wieczorek-zeul said .
as part of her new role , she 'll also be responsible for helping to make the un 's millennium goals a reality .
the goals include the reduction of debt of developing country , lifting trade restrictions and strengthening the financial power of poorer countries .
red and reliable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul wants to make sure that developing countries get a chance wieczorek-zeul , also known as " red heidi " because of her leftist views and the color of her hair , said that her nomination was a confirmation of " the high level of trust in the federal government and the reliability of german politics " at the united nations .
by picking wieczorek-zeul and manuel , the un secretary general chose a representative from an industrialized and a developing country .
the doha conference is a follow-up meeting to another summit that took place in monterrey , mexico , 2002 .
in light of the global food shortage , wieczorek-zeul called for an increased support for regional agriculture in developing countries .
" we think there 's a lot of work to be done , " she told german daily neue presse , adding that combating hunger and poverty was the most important thing for her .
bad subsidies the minister is also working towards ending export subsidies for agricultural products .
she said that this was something that had to be achieved as fast as possible during negotiations at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
sending subsidized food to developing countries was preventing local production and therefore had to stop , she said .
wieczorek-zeul also reiterated her promise to offer 10 million euros -lrb- $ 15.8 million -rrb- to the un 's world food program .
she said , however , that this could not happen by cutting money from other areas of development aid .

the german press says the strategic move is risky , but unavoidable . the landmark coalition agreement signed on thursday , april 17 , in hamburg 's city hall , follows five weeks of intensive political negotiations that centered on energy and environmental issues .
it is expected to be formally approved by party executives at the end of the month . " in politics as in normal life , it is important to have the strength and the courage to walk new paths , " said hamburg 's cdu mayor ole von beust .
" it 's not an experiment but a chance ...
even if it may seem unusual to many , i 'm convinced it 'll be a success for hamburg . " von beust lost his absolute majority in the feb .
24 state elections and his party has since then been on the search for a suitable coalition partner . berlin wo n't follow suit , says chancellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gave her blessing but said hamburg would n't set an example for berlin chancellor angela merkel , who is also head of the cdu , welcomed the new partnership in the city-state of hamburg , but denied speculations that it could be a sign of things to come at the federal level . the greens have typically partnered with the spd and the cdu has traditionally found an ally in the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , but the addition of fifth party - the left party - has forced political camps to rethink their well-practice two-party alliances . for both the cdu and the greens in hamburg , " it 's just about opening up new options in the new five-party system , " wrote the financial times deutschland on friday .
" for chancellor and cdu chairwoman angela merkel , nothing less than securing her chancellorship beyond the election year 2009 and the likely end of the grand coalition -lsb- of the cdu and spd -rsb- are at stake .
for this goal , serious conflicts are simply papered over , particularly in the areas of economic and energy policy . " coal question remains unanswered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants large ships to be able to access hamburg 's port indeed , energy was a key point in negotiations between the two sides .
the cdu plans to build a large coal-fired power station within the city limits , which the greens oppose .
no agreement was reached before the coalition deal was written up . however , the environmental party did yield to a cdu-supported initiative to deepen the elbe river so that large container ships can access one of europe 's largest ports . " now older and wiser , the children who had once run away from the middle-class are coming back , " opined the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday from munich .
" the greens are becoming the junior partner of the party that they once considered to represent the bleak , stale , unenlightened middle-class .
and ole von beust ... is making it easy for them because he has a big heart . " von beust partnered with the far-right party pro from 2001 to 2004 , the paper pointed out , and has now turned to the greens at the other end of the political spectrum .
" that ’ s not a lack of principles ; it 's politics .
above all , politics is concerned with power . " " a break in germany 's party history " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have von beust and greens head christa goetsch pushed the problems under the rug ?
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said that it 's not just the greens who are changing their image , but the cdu as well , " breaking out of its middle-class camp was of utmost priority for the cdu . " one does n't have to think hard about the current developments in the party landscape to figure out why the cdu is doing this to itself .
if it had limited itself to its previous coalition possibilities - grand coalition or black-yellow -lsb- cdu-fdp -rsb- - the conservatives ' government possibilities could be counted on one hand . " even with just this one state collation , the cdu " can still put pressure on its traditional coalition partner , " continued the paper . berlin 's tagesspiegel considers the milestone coalition " a break in germany 's party history . " " if it 's successful , the hamburg coalition will contribute to the de-ideologization of german politics , so that it 's no longer membership in a political camp but agreement on individual issues that will determine how governments are built , " wrote the paper on friday . " for the voters , that means that politics is becoming less predictable and more complicated .

" we demand that russia stop all actions which breach georgia 's sovereignty , " the former soviet republic 's pro-western president , mikhail saakashvili , told ministers at a cabinet meeting , his press office said thursday , april 17 .

but this development is being driven by what experts say is a " worrying " explosion in the low-wage sector . over the past 10 years , the number of people considered to be low-wage earners in germany increased from 15 to 22 percent , reaching a total of 6.5 million people , a new study has found .
one in five germans today works in the " low-wage " sector and , as of last year , some 200,000 employed people resort to taking an additional " mini-job " to make ends meet .
" the conclusions for germany are worrying , " said gerhard bosch of the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for work , skills and training -lrb- iaq -rrb- , which carried out research for the study in britain , denmark , france , germany , the netherlands and the us .
the development is in part due to the german government , which has intentionally been expanding the low-wage sector in recent years in order to bring down the country 's high unemployment levels .
a general shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the boom in low-wage jobs , the middle class is in danger of eroding but bosch 's colleague at the iaq , dorothea voss-dahm , told dw-world.de that a general shift in society is also to blame .
" for so many years , we 've heard that germany is inflexible in its labor laws , " she said .
" now , companies and employee associations are saying , let 's try something different . "
the low-wage explosion could not have happened without the introduction in 2003 of the so-called " mini-job " in germany .
under the scheme , employees can earn 400 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- month and are exempt from paying tax and social insurance contributions .
but according to voss-dahm , employers have seized on mini-jobs as a way to push wage levels down , with the result that the wage gap is widening , and germany 's middle class shrinking .

" if the government does n't do anything to turn this around , germany 's low-wage sector could become larger than that of the us , where every fourth person is a low-wage earner , " american economist robert solow told the frankfurter rundschau .
the authors of the german study admitted that they had n't expected " such unflattering results . "
in comparison with the us , low-wage earners in germany are still better off , as the social net ensures they have health insurance , paid vacation and generous pension benefits .
but the idea that germany 's economy is bolstered by low-wage jobs and people who have to work several jobs just to survive is new .
" in germany , we 've only just begun to realize that poverty could become a problem , " said the iaq 's voss-dahm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.04.2008 opinion : denounce but do n't ban far-right npd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should denounce extremism but not ban the far-right npd , said parliamentarian hans-peter uhl .
on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .
unapologetically separating oneself from extremist ideas is adherent to this .
we , therefore , condemn the often glib fight " against the right " when it indiscriminately excludes legitimate concerns in the democratic opinion spectrum and lumps them together with extremist content . any suggestions to cut funding to the npd should be examined and , if possible , successfully carried out .
but there are legal risks involved here as well .
the principle of tiered equality for all parties that are n't banned tightly restricts special treatment . public debate should not lead to unnecessary extra attention for the npd .
when the group is mentioned , its platform should be denounced in the same breath .
the npd should in no way benefit from this short-sighted party conflict . hans-peter uhl is the domestic policy speaker for the cdu-csu faction in the german parliament . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we demand that russia stop all actions which breach georgia 's sovereignty , " the former soviet republic 's pro-western president , mikhail saakashvili , told ministers at a cabinet meeting , his press office said thursday , april 17 . " the russian federation has made yet another extremely dangerous step towards the de facto annexation of integral parts of georgia 's internationally recognized territory , " georgia 's foreign ministry said in a statement . " we need serious actions , not only words from our partners in the next days and weeks , " said saakashvili , adding that he would be sending foreign minister david bakradze to the united states and euro-atlantic integration minister giorgi baramidze to germany and france to discuss the issue . georgia 's mission to the european union said baramidze had scheduled emergency meetings with nato ambassadors as well as with eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner for friday . russia 's decision has already elicited expressions of concern from the eu and a call from nato for moscow to reverse the measure . russian roulette bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili believes georgia 's sovereignty is in peril tbilisi was reacting to russia 's announcement wednesday that it would be stepping up cooperation with the two pro-moscow breakaway regions , abkhazia and south ossetia , in trade , culture and other areas . the move is intended to pave the way for " mechanisms for the complete protection of the rights , freedoms and legal interests " of russian citizens living in the regions , the russian foreign ministry said . the two regions broke away from georgian control during wars in the 1990s following the country 's independence , after the collapse of the soviet union . unwilling to lose influence in the strategic south caucasus region along its southern border , russia has backed abkhazia and south ossetia both financially and by providing russian citizenship to most of their residents . the nato factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 18-month separatist war between georgia and south ossetia ended in 1992 meanwhile , abkhazia 's self-appointed president sergei bagapsh said georgia was building up troops and artillery along the border and threatened to deploy abkhaz armed forces unless georgia withdrew by the end of friday . saakashvili has pledged to regain control over abkhazia and south ossetia and has long accused the kremlin of stirring up separatism . moscow insists it will stop short of recognizing the independence of the two provinces , a move which analysts say could boost separatist feeling in several russian regions . in fact , russia has increased its support for the separatists in response to western recognition of kosovo as an independent nation .
moscow opposed kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence from serbia in february . in bucharest earlier this month , nato promised that georgia would eventually be given membership in the alliance and cited the country 's fragmented status as one reason for denying georgia 's request to be put on a definite track for membership through nato 's membership action plan . according to the statement released by georgia 's foreign ministry thursday , russia 's actions are an attempt to " not allow georgia 's rapprochement with nato , something an absolute majority of georgian citizens ... firmly supports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 18.04.2008 france warns climate change triggers global conflict großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is climate catastrophe just around the corner ?
on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .
climate change as a trigger of conflict the event which took place is this week was the third in the mem series first launched in september 2007 .
its stated goal was to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen conference and draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" climate change is already having a considerable impact on security , " sarkozy said in his speech to ministers from the 16 economies that together account for 80 percent of the planet 's greenhouse-gas emissions - including australia , brazil , britain , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , south korea , mexico , russia , south africa and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did climate change contribute to the darfur crisis ?
" water scarcity and rivalry for farmland and fishing resources were emerging as " major challenges , " he said , pointing to the african example .
" in darfur , we see this explosive mixture from the impact of climate change , which prompts immigration by increasingly impoverished people , which then has consequences in war . "
" if we keep going down this path , climate change will encourage the immigration of people with nothing towards areas where the population do have something , and the darfur crisis will be only one crisis among dozens of others , " he stressed .
un secretary general ban ki-moon last june was the first to suggest that the darfur conflict arose " at least in part " from climate change .
reacting to food crisis in his speech , sarkozy also weighed into the debate over food prices , saying the current food crisis called not only for an immediate response but also for an ambitious strategy to support agriculture , and pledging to double france 's emergency food aid this year to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
" we can not remain indifferent to the unrest among those people who , in the developing countries , can no longer satisfy their hunger , " he said .
soaring prices for basic grains such as rice , wheat , soybean and corn , have provoked protests and rioting in at least half a dozen developing countries in past months , reports afp .
experts have pinpointed climate change as a factor here too , arguing that rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns may be contributing to water scarcity .
biofuels , championed to help reduce carbon emissions and ease dependence on fossil fuels , have also started to become contentious .
with programs such as those in the us and brazil converting grains , sugar and soy beans into ethanol and biodiesel , the boom in biofuels has become key to the food crisis .
bush-bashing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush 's environment policies have been described as " neanderthal " tempers had flared at the meeting on thursday when criticism was leveled at us president george w. bush 's new climate plan .
bush said on wednesday that he wanted us emissions to peak by 2025 , a measure dismissed as too little too late by the eu and germany , with german environment minister sigmar gabriel describing the plan as " neanderthal . "
the white house on thursday played down germany 's criticism .
" you 're always going to see lots of hot-blooded reaction to anything said on climate , and so you should just be prepared for that , " said tony fratto , a white house spokesman .
fratto said climate change is such a contentious issue that it was no surprise that bush faced criticism over his proposal .
" slings and arrows would have been thrown no matter what we said , and that 's the nature of the debate on climate change , " fratto said .
" and you 're never going to make everyone happy on it . "
sarkozy refrained on friday from referring directly to the us feet-dragging , but his message was clear .
" we can not afford the luxury that one of you remains behind by the roadside because the whole planet needs every one of you , " he said .
" i would like to pass on a simple message to you : the situation is urgent . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the longest serving member of germany 's government , who has been in office since 1998 , she is now taking on an honorary job for the united nations .
as the un 's special envoy , wieczorek-zeul - together with south african finance minister trevor manuel - is organizing the international conference on financing for development , which will take place in doha , qatar , from nov .
29 to dec .
2 .
the meeting is expected to focus on taking stock of current development cooperation and come up with binding assurances for the future , wieczorek-zeul said .
as part of her new role , she 'll also be responsible for helping to make the un 's millennium goals a reality .
the goals include the reduction of debt of developing country , lifting trade restrictions and strengthening the financial power of poorer countries .
red and reliable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul wants to make sure that developing countries get a chance wieczorek-zeul , also known as " red heidi " because of her leftist views and the color of her hair , said that her nomination was a confirmation of " the high level of trust in the federal government and the reliability of german politics " at the united nations .
by picking wieczorek-zeul and manuel , the un secretary general chose a representative from an industrialized and a developing country .
the doha conference is a follow-up meeting to another summit that took place in monterrey , mexico , 2002 .
in light of the global food shortage , wieczorek-zeul called for an increased support for regional agriculture in developing countries .
" we think there 's a lot of work to be done , " she told german daily neue presse , adding that combating hunger and poverty was the most important thing for her .
bad subsidies the minister is also working towards ending export subsidies for agricultural products .
she said that this was something that had to be achieved as fast as possible during negotiations at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
sending subsidized food to developing countries was preventing local production and therefore had to stop , she said .
wieczorek-zeul also reiterated her promise to offer 10 million euros -lrb- $ 15.8 million -rrb- to the un 's world food program .
she said , however , that this could not happen by cutting money from other areas of development aid .
budget battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer streinbrueck expects budget cuts from several ministries " this clearly means that development aid funds will have to rise , " said the minister , who is currently fighting with germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck over the coming budget .
steinbrueck , who is also a social democrat , recently provoked a rift within the government by telling several ministries that they had to lower their budget plans .
wieczorek-zeul is banking on german chancellor angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union .
she said that her ministry simply wants to implement the promises which the chancellor made at last year 's g8 summit . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german press says the strategic move is risky , but unavoidable . the landmark coalition agreement signed on thursday , april 17 , in hamburg 's city hall , follows five weeks of intensive political negotiations that centered on energy and environmental issues .
it is expected to be formally approved by party executives at the end of the month . " in politics as in normal life , it is important to have the strength and the courage to walk new paths , " said hamburg 's cdu mayor ole von beust .
" it 's not an experiment but a chance ...
even if it may seem unusual to many , i 'm convinced it 'll be a success for hamburg . " von beust lost his absolute majority in the feb .
24 state elections and his party has since then been on the search for a suitable coalition partner . berlin wo n't follow suit , says chancellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gave her blessing but said hamburg would n't set an example for berlin chancellor angela merkel , who is also head of the cdu , welcomed the new partnership in the city-state of hamburg , but denied speculations that it could be a sign of things to come at the federal level . the greens have typically partnered with the spd and the cdu has traditionally found an ally in the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , but the addition of fifth party - the left party - has forced political camps to rethink their well-practice two-party alliances . for both the cdu and the greens in hamburg , " it 's just about opening up new options in the new five-party system , " wrote the financial times deutschland on friday .
" for chancellor and cdu chairwoman angela merkel , nothing less than securing her chancellorship beyond the election year 2009 and the likely end of the grand coalition -lsb- of the cdu and spd -rsb- are at stake .
for this goal , serious conflicts are simply papered over , particularly in the areas of economic and energy policy . " coal question remains unanswered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants large ships to be able to access hamburg 's port indeed , energy was a key point in negotiations between the two sides .
the cdu plans to build a large coal-fired power station within the city limits , which the greens oppose .
no agreement was reached before the coalition deal was written up . however , the environmental party did yield to a cdu-supported initiative to deepen the elbe river so that large container ships can access one of europe 's largest ports . " now older and wiser , the children who had once run away from the middle-class are coming back , " opined the sueddeutsche zeitung on friday from munich .
" the greens are becoming the junior partner of the party that they once considered to represent the bleak , stale , unenlightened middle-class .
and ole von beust ... is making it easy for them because he has a big heart . " von beust partnered with the far-right party pro from 2001 to 2004 , the paper pointed out , and has now turned to the greens at the other end of the political spectrum .
" that ’ s not a lack of principles ; it 's politics .
above all , politics is concerned with power . " " a break in germany 's party history " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have von beust and greens head christa goetsch pushed the problems under the rug ?
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said that it 's not just the greens who are changing their image , but the cdu as well , " breaking out of its middle-class camp was of utmost priority for the cdu . " one does n't have to think hard about the current developments in the party landscape to figure out why the cdu is doing this to itself .
if it had limited itself to its previous coalition possibilities - grand coalition or black-yellow -lsb- cdu-fdp -rsb- - the conservatives ' government possibilities could be counted on one hand . " even with just this one state collation , the cdu " can still put pressure on its traditional coalition partner , " continued the paper . berlin 's tagesspiegel considers the milestone coalition " a break in germany 's party history . " " if it 's successful , the hamburg coalition will contribute to the de-ideologization of german politics , so that it 's no longer membership in a political camp but agreement on individual issues that will determine how governments are built , " wrote the paper on friday . " for the voters , that means that politics is becoming less predictable and more complicated .

on the last day of the major economics meeting , french president nicolas sarkozy called on the world 's major economies to fight global warming faster , pointing to new scientific evidence confirming worst-case scenarios . the french president struck a gloomy note as the mem wound down in paris on friday , april 18 , telling the world 's biggest carbon polluters that global warming was becoming a driver of hunger , unrest and conflict , and urging them to abandon their defensive strategies in the face of developments he described as catastrophic .
" we must act , " sarkozy told the delegates .
" bad news continues to emerge .
scientific models and empirical observations indicate that the events unfolding now confirm the experts ' most gloomy scenarios , " he stressed .
sarkozy also called on emerging nations , such as china and india , to fight global warming .
" you can not want to have the rights of great economic powers that you are becoming and abstain from your responsibilities , " he said .
" fairness demands that all participate in the common effort , even if the developed countries must accept more stringent constraints than the developing countries , " he stressed .
climate change as a trigger of conflict the event which took place is this week was the third in the mem series first launched in september 2007 .
its stated goal was to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen conference and draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
" climate change is already having a considerable impact on security , " sarkozy said in his speech to ministers from the 16 economies that together account for 80 percent of the planet 's greenhouse-gas emissions - including australia , brazil , britain , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , south korea , mexico , russia , south africa and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did climate change contribute to the darfur crisis ?
" water scarcity and rivalry for farmland and fishing resources were emerging as " major challenges , " he said , pointing to the african example .
" in darfur , we see this explosive mixture from the impact of climate change , which prompts immigration by increasingly impoverished people , which then has consequences in war . "
" if we keep going down this path , climate change will encourage the immigration of people with nothing towards areas where the population do have something , and the darfur crisis will be only one crisis among dozens of others , " he stressed .
un secretary general ban ki-moon last june was the first to suggest that the darfur conflict arose " at least in part " from climate change .
reacting to food crisis in his speech , sarkozy also weighed into the debate over food prices , saying the current food crisis called not only for an immediate response but also for an ambitious strategy to support agriculture , and pledging to double france 's emergency food aid this year to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
" we can not remain indifferent to the unrest among those people who , in the developing countries , can no longer satisfy their hunger , " he said .
soaring prices for basic grains such as rice , wheat , soybean and corn , have provoked protests and rioting in at least half a dozen developing countries in past months , reports afp .
experts have pinpointed climate change as a factor here too , arguing that rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns may be contributing to water scarcity .
biofuels , championed to help reduce carbon emissions and ease dependence on fossil fuels , have also started to become contentious .
with programs such as those in the us and brazil converting grains , sugar and soy beans into ethanol and biodiesel , the boom in biofuels has become key to the food crisis .
bush-bashing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush 's environment policies have been described as " neanderthal " tempers had flared at the meeting on thursday when criticism was leveled at us president george w. bush 's new climate plan .
bush said on wednesday that he wanted us emissions to peak by 2025 , a measure dismissed as too little too late by the eu and germany , with german environment minister sigmar gabriel describing the plan as " neanderthal . "
the white house on thursday played down germany 's criticism .
" you 're always going to see lots of hot-blooded reaction to anything said on climate , and so you should just be prepared for that , " said tony fratto , a white house spokesman .
fratto said climate change is such a contentious issue that it was no surprise that bush faced criticism over his proposal .
" slings and arrows would have been thrown no matter what we said , and that 's the nature of the debate on climate change , " fratto said .
" and you 're never going to make everyone happy on it . "
sarkozy refrained on friday from referring directly to the us feet-dragging , but his message was clear .
" we can not afford the luxury that one of you remains behind by the roadside because the whole planet needs every one of you , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did climate change contribute to the darfur crisis ?
" water scarcity and rivalry for farmland and fishing resources were emerging as " major challenges , " he said , pointing to the african example .
" in darfur , we see this explosive mixture from the impact of climate change , which prompts immigration by increasingly impoverished people , which then has consequences in war . "
" if we keep going down this path , climate change will encourage the immigration of people with nothing towards areas where the population do have something , and the darfur crisis will be only one crisis among dozens of others , " he stressed .
un secretary general ban ki-moon last june was the first to suggest that the darfur conflict arose " at least in part " from climate change .
reacting to food crisis in his speech , sarkozy also weighed into the debate over food prices , saying the current food crisis called not only for an immediate response but also for an ambitious strategy to support agriculture , and pledging to double france 's emergency food aid this year to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
" we can not remain indifferent to the unrest among those people who , in the developing countries , can no longer satisfy their hunger , " he said .
soaring prices for basic grains such as rice , wheat , soybean and corn , have provoked protests and rioting in at least half a dozen developing countries in past months , reports afp .
experts have pinpointed climate change as a factor here too , arguing that rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns may be contributing to water scarcity .
biofuels , championed to help reduce carbon emissions and ease dependence on fossil fuels , have also started to become contentious .
with programs such as those in the us and brazil converting grains , sugar and soy beans into ethanol and biodiesel , the boom in biofuels has become key to the food crisis .
bush-bashing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush 's environment policies have been described as " neanderthal " tempers had flared at the meeting on thursday when criticism was leveled at us president george w. bush 's new climate plan .
bush said on wednesday that he wanted us emissions to peak by 2025 , a measure dismissed as too little too late by the eu and germany , with german environment minister sigmar gabriel describing the plan as " neanderthal . "
the white house on thursday played down germany 's criticism .
" you 're always going to see lots of hot-blooded reaction to anything said on climate , and so you should just be prepared for that , " said tony fratto , a white house spokesman .
fratto said climate change is such a contentious issue that it was no surprise that bush faced criticism over his proposal .
" slings and arrows would have been thrown no matter what we said , and that 's the nature of the debate on climate change , " fratto said .
" and you 're never going to make everyone happy on it . "
sarkozy refrained on friday from referring directly to the us feet-dragging , but his message was clear .
" we can not afford the luxury that one of you remains behind by the roadside because the whole planet needs every one of you , " he said .
" i would like to pass on a simple message to you : the situation is urgent . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's just as well he was wrong . after news of this david and goliath tale spread around the world , nasa brought the international media back to earth with a bump on wednesday when it issued a statement says the whiz kid was wrong .
the agency said its figures are correct when it comes to the asteroid apophis , not the boy 's .
" we stand by our numbers , " nasa spokesman dwayne brown told afp .
stars in his eyes the agency that oversees space shuttle missions and unmanned space probes made its comments after the german newspaper potsdamer neuester nachrichten reported on tuesday that supremely self-confident local teenager nico marquardt had calculated there was a 1 in 450 chance that the apophis asteroid will collide with earth .
in a project for a regional science competition , marquardt set out to demonstrate that scientists at nasa had got it wrong when they estimated the chances of a collision at only 1 in 45,000 .
he might have slipped up , but the junior astronomer certainly had some of the world 's finest scientific minds worried there .
protesting too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not doomsday just yet experts at the agency 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california , insist they never had any doubts about their calculations , brown said .
the near-earth object program office " has not changed its current estimates for the very low probability -lrb- 1 in 45,000 -rrb- of an earth impact by the asteroid apophis in 2036 , " brown said in a statement .
the student 's estimates were reportedly based on the asteroid hitting a satellite in 2029 .
" however , the asteroid will not pass near the main belt of geosynchronous satellites in 2029 , and the chance of a collision with a satellite is exceedingly remote , " said the statement . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.04.2008 opinion : denounce but do n't ban far-right npd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should denounce extremism but not ban the far-right npd , said parliamentarian hans-peter uhl .
on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .

on thursday , april 17 , the state interior ministers blocked a repeat bid to make the controversial party illegal . the first effort to ban the npd , led by former interior minister otto schily , failed in 2003 .
the constitutional court rejected the case because the implicating evidence had been influenced by informants to the federal office for the protection of the constitution .
nothing has changed since then . once again , the state interior ministers have agreed not to pursue another request to ban the npd .
ultimately , they would have to guarantee that the informants had not influenced any of the material collected to prove that the party is unconstitutional .
to do this , they would have to remove all of the informants and obtain new evidence over a longer period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter uhl this , however , would create a security risk , since possible crimes could be planned , which the state would n't know about without the informants in place . the spd , which has tried to score points on the domestic policy field in the past few weeks with an npd ban , is now empty-handed . the cdu and csu wo n't tolerate accusations of being lenient toward right-wing extremism .
on the contrary , we wo n't be outdone in the fight against extremist ideas .
the basic democratic rule in the fight against unconstitutional ideologies is political debate , in order to win the heads and hearts of the people . it 's a mistake to believe that deleting a party name would also delete the extremist ideas it represents .
the npd offers primitive , mono-causal solutions and misdirected statements .
these can not be silently tolerated in civil society and in politics , but should be rejected and ostracized .
this path may be tedious , but there is no alternative . it 's also important that politics and the media do n't abet political disenchantment but respond to problematic developments in a responsible way before extremist pied pipers get involved . for this reason , the cdu makes an effort to offer people on the right of the political spectrum more moderate orientation , in order to integrate them in a way that corresponds to the constitutional order .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 18.04.2008 germany 's low-wage explosion worries experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20 percent of germans are employed in the low-wage sector germany 's economy appears to be humming along , with unemployment figures at their lowest in 15 years .
but this development is being driven by what experts say is a " worrying " explosion in the low-wage sector . over the past 10 years , the number of people considered to be low-wage earners in germany increased from 15 to 22 percent , reaching a total of 6.5 million people , a new study has found .
one in five germans today works in the " low-wage " sector and , as of last year , some 200,000 employed people resort to taking an additional " mini-job " to make ends meet .
" the conclusions for germany are worrying , " said gerhard bosch of the university of duisburg-essen 's institute for work , skills and training -lrb- iaq -rrb- , which carried out research for the study in britain , denmark , france , germany , the netherlands and the us .
the development is in part due to the german government , which has intentionally been expanding the low-wage sector in recent years in order to bring down the country 's high unemployment levels .
a general shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the boom in low-wage jobs , the middle class is in danger of eroding but bosch 's colleague at the iaq , dorothea voss-dahm , told dw-world.de that a general shift in society is also to blame .
" for so many years , we 've heard that germany is inflexible in its labor laws , " she said .
" now , companies and employee associations are saying , let 's try something different . "
the low-wage explosion could not have happened without the introduction in 2003 of the so-called " mini-job " in germany .
under the scheme , employees can earn 400 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- month and are exempt from paying tax and social insurance contributions .
but according to voss-dahm , employers have seized on mini-jobs as a way to push wage levels down , with the result that the wage gap is widening , and germany 's middle class shrinking .
" if the middle class erodes , then over the long term , our whole society will change , " voss-dahm said .
" the middle class is the layer upon which our society was built . "
authors surprised by unflattering picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans are learning what it feels like to be " poor despite employment " the study on low-wage sectors in europe and the us showed that , with 22 percent of the workforce considered low-wage earners , germany has already eclipsed britain -lrb- 21.7 percent -rrb- and is catching up with the us -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- .
" if the government does n't do anything to turn this around , germany 's low-wage sector could become larger than that of the us , where every fourth person is a low-wage earner , " american economist robert solow told the frankfurter rundschau .
the authors of the german study admitted that they had n't expected " such unflattering results . "
in comparison with the us , low-wage earners in germany are still better off , as the social net ensures they have health insurance , paid vacation and generous pension benefits .
but the idea that germany 's economy is bolstered by low-wage jobs and people who have to work several jobs just to survive is new .
" in germany , we 've only just begun to realize that poverty could become a problem , " said the iaq 's voss-dahm .
she said the government could take two corrective steps : abolish the mini-job regulations , which would remove the incentive for companies to lower wages ; and introduce a minimum wage which would ensure that even those in lower paying jobs can still make ends meet . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

months later his local mp was to make a speech which would spark one of the biggest race debates in uk history .
on the afternoon of 20 april 1968 at the midland hotel , in birmingham , enoch powell addressed the meeting of the conservative political centre .
they were words that would raise ethnic tensions in the west midlands and lead to riots on the streets .
" we were very scared , " said mr mattu .
" my mother and father used to say , ' come straight home from school and if you see a skinhead go straight to someone 's door ' . "
in that infamous speech mr powell gave apocalyptic-style predictions of what would happen to pockets of britain - such as wolverhampton - if mass immigration continued .
he compared racial tensions in the united states to the roman poet virgil 's description of " the river tiber foaming with much blood " and said anti-discrimination laws were like " throwing a match on to gunpowder " .
with 40 years hindsight , what difference did the speech make ?
the west midlands had been one of the main destinations of immigrants , with people from the commonwealth initially being encouraged to come to work in its many factories .
race card powell , who represented wolverhampton south west , was not the first politician in that era to find himself embroiled in such controversy .
in the 1964 general election campaign in nearby smethwick , supporters of the tory candidate peter griffiths were reported to have circulated the slogan , " if you want a nigger for a neighbour - vote labour " .
the incumbent labour mp patrick gordon walker lost to griffiths in a shock defeat .
it was the race relations act introduced by the labour government in 1968 which prompted powell 's speech .
he argued it would mean " british " families losing out on matters such as housing , with immigrants being given an unfair advantage .
black sociologist dr clive harris said that playing the race card at that time had proved to have " mileage " for politicians .
he said : " i think enoch powell was aware that what he said in public was what a lot of people were thinking in private .
" he knew there was a lot of panic going on that time at government level about the numbers of kenyan and asian immigrants coming into britain and how to cope with potentially thousands of them . "
in the speech powell referred to what he said were the experiences of one of his constituents - an elderly war widow supposedly the last white person in her street .
' talk of skinheads ' powell said a correspondent had described how the woman had repeatedly refused to allow non-white people to rent rooms in her house , which led to her being called a racist and having excrement pushed through her letterbox .
powell 's words earned him the sack as shadow defence secretary , but also generated the support of many ordinary people .
the mp said he received about 100,000 letters backing what he had said .
dockers in some parts of the uk marched to express their agreement .
" i remember the local talk of skinheads , " said mr mattu , who is now a wolverhampton city councillor . "
i ca n't bring myself to thank enoch powell for that speech , but it was a wake-up call " elias mattu " i think it did give rise to that movement - the speech united them .
those were the bad times . "
the nine-year-old saw riots in local streets with members of both the white and asian communities joining in .
he also saw family friends jailed for their part in the disorder .
powell estimated that by the year 2000 there would be five to seven million immigrants and their descendants in britain , about a 10th of the population .
the office of national statistics says that in 2001-2002 7.6 % of the uk 's population was from non-white ethnic minorities .
' powell was right ' in more recent times , there has been support for powell 's speech .
in october nigel hastilow , a prospective parliamentary candidate for the conservatives , was forced to resign after agreeing with powell in a newspaper article .
the prospective candidate for halesowen and rowley regis wrote in his express & star newspaper column : " when you ask many people in the black country what the single biggest problem facing the country is , most people say immigration . "
" many insist : ' enoch powell was right ' .
he was right . "
mr hastilow has said he will not give interviews to the bbc about the " rivers of blood " speech .
the current mp for powell 's old constituency , rob marris , was also living in wolverhampton at the time of the speech .
" the reality is that some people agreed with nigel hastilow , but a lot of people did not , especially in wolverhampton , " said mr marris , who is a labour mp .
" i 'm not going to say that community relations are perfect in wolverhampton today , but i would say that they are among the best in the country .
" things have changed a lot since enoch powell 's day , but we have to keep working at it . "
in fact , some believe that powell 's speech actually did a lot of good for wolverhampton .
" it showed that there was a problem with racism and that something needed to be done , " said mr mattu , who now also sits on the west midlands equality and diversity partnership .

months later his local mp was to make a speech which would spark one of the biggest race debates in uk history .
on the afternoon of 20 april 1968 at the midland hotel , in birmingham , enoch powell addressed the meeting of the conservative political centre .
they were words that would raise ethnic tensions in the west midlands and lead to riots on the streets .
" we were very scared , " said mr mattu .
" my mother and father used to say , ' come straight home from school and if you see a skinhead go straight to someone 's door ' . "
powell spoke of a letter he had received about an elderly widow in that infamous speech mr powell gave apocalyptic-style predictions of what would happen to pockets of britain - such as wolverhampton - if mass immigration continued .
he compared racial tensions in the united states to the roman poet virgil 's description of " the river tiber foaming with much blood " and said anti-discrimination laws were like " throwing a match on to gunpowder " .
with 40 years hindsight , what difference did the speech make ?
the west midlands had been one of the main destinations of immigrants , with people from the commonwealth initially being encouraged to come to work in its many factories .
race card powell , who represented wolverhampton south west , was not the first politician in that era to find himself embroiled in such controversy .
in the 1964 general election campaign in nearby smethwick , supporters of the tory candidate peter griffiths were reported to have circulated the slogan , " if you want a nigger for a neighbour - vote labour " .
the incumbent labour mp patrick gordon walker lost to griffiths in a shock defeat .
it was the race relations act introduced by the labour government in 1968 which prompted powell 's speech .
elias mattu has lived in wolverhampton since he came to the uk he argued it would mean " british " families losing out on matters such as housing , with immigrants being given an unfair advantage .
black sociologist dr clive harris said that playing the race card at that time had proved to have " mileage " for politicians .
he said : " i think enoch powell was aware that what he said in public was what a lot of people were thinking in private .
" he knew there was a lot of panic going on that time at government level about the numbers of kenyan and asian immigrants coming into britain and how to cope with potentially thousands of them . "
in the speech powell referred to what he said were the experiences of one of his constituents - an elderly war widow supposedly the last white person in her street .
' talk of skinheads ' powell said a correspondent had described how the woman had repeatedly refused to allow non-white people to rent rooms in her house , which led to her being called a racist and having excrement pushed through her letterbox .
powell 's words earned him the sack as shadow defence secretary , but also generated the support of many ordinary people .
the mp said he received about 100,000 letters backing what he had said .
dockers in some parts of the uk marched to express their agreement .
" i remember the local talk of skinheads , " said mr mattu , who is now a wolverhampton city councillor .
i ca n't bring myself to thank enoch powell for that speech , but it was a wake-up call elias mattu " i think it did give rise to that movement - the speech united them .
those were the bad times . "
the nine-year-old saw riots in local streets with members of both the white and asian communities joining in .
he also saw family friends jailed for their part in the disorder .
powell estimated that by the year 2000 there would be five to seven million immigrants and their descendants in britain , about a 10th of the population .
the office of national statistics says that in 2001-2002 7.6 % of the uk 's population was from non-white ethnic minorities .
' powell was right ' in more recent times , there has been support for powell 's speech .
in october nigel hastilow , a prospective parliamentary candidate for the conservatives , was forced to resign after agreeing with powell in a newspaper article .
the prospective candidate for halesowen and rowley regis wrote in his express & star newspaper column : " when you ask many people in the black country what the single biggest problem facing the country is , most people say immigration . "
" many insist : ' enoch powell was right ' .
he was right . "
mr hastilow has said he will not give interviews to the bbc about the " rivers of blood " speech .
dr clive harris said politicians had played the " race card " in the 1960s the current mp for powell 's old constituency , rob marris , was also living in wolverhampton at the time of the speech .
" the reality is that some people agreed with nigel hastilow , but a lot of people did not , especially in wolverhampton , " said mr marris , who is a labour mp .
" i 'm not going to say that community relations are perfect in wolverhampton today , but i would say that they are among the best in the country .
" things have changed a lot since enoch powell 's day , but we have to keep working at it . "
in fact , some believe that powell 's speech actually did a lot of good for wolverhampton .
" it showed that there was a problem with racism and that something needed to be done , " said mr mattu , who now also sits on the west midlands equality and diversity partnership .
" there was an elderly white lady who lived next to us , who told us not to listen to enoch powell because he was an evil man .
" people like her , which was the majority , also united .
community groups worked together to ensure that racism could not continue and in that way wolverhampton became ahead of its time .
" i ca n't bring myself to thank enoch powell for that speech , but it was a wake-up call . "

" he knew there was a lot of panic going on that time at government level about the numbers of kenyan and asian immigrants coming into britain and how to cope with potentially thousands of them . "
in the speech powell referred to what he said were the experiences of one of his constituents - an elderly war widow supposedly the last white person in her street .
' talk of skinheads ' powell said a correspondent had described how the woman had repeatedly refused to allow non-white people to rent rooms in her house , which led to her being called a racist and having excrement pushed through her letterbox .
powell 's words earned him the sack as shadow defence secretary , but also generated the support of many ordinary people .
the mp said he received about 100,000 letters backing what he had said .
dockers in some parts of the uk marched to express their agreement .
" i remember the local talk of skinheads , " said mr mattu , who is now a wolverhampton city councillor .
i ca n't bring myself to thank enoch powell for that speech , but it was a wake-up call elias mattu " i think it did give rise to that movement - the speech united them .
those were the bad times . "
the nine-year-old saw riots in local streets with members of both the white and asian communities joining in .
he also saw family friends jailed for their part in the disorder .
powell estimated that by the year 2000 there would be five to seven million immigrants and their descendants in britain , about a 10th of the population .
the office of national statistics says that in 2001-2002 7.6 % of the uk 's population was from non-white ethnic minorities .
' powell was right ' in more recent times , there has been support for powell 's speech .
in october nigel hastilow , a prospective parliamentary candidate for the conservatives , was forced to resign after agreeing with powell in a newspaper article .
the prospective candidate for halesowen and rowley regis wrote in his express & star newspaper column : " when you ask many people in the black country what the single biggest problem facing the country is , most people say immigration . "
" many insist : ' enoch powell was right ' .
he was right . "
mr hastilow has said he will not give interviews to the bbc about the " rivers of blood " speech .
dr clive harris said politicians had played the " race card " in the 1960s the current mp for powell 's old constituency , rob marris , was also living in wolverhampton at the time of the speech .
" the reality is that some people agreed with nigel hastilow , but a lot of people did not , especially in wolverhampton , " said mr marris , who is a labour mp .
" i 'm not going to say that community relations are perfect in wolverhampton today , but i would say that they are among the best in the country .
" things have changed a lot since enoch powell 's day , but we have to keep working at it . "
in fact , some believe that powell 's speech actually did a lot of good for wolverhampton .
" it showed that there was a problem with racism and that something needed to be done , " said mr mattu , who now also sits on the west midlands equality and diversity partnership .
" there was an elderly white lady who lived next to us , who told us not to listen to enoch powell because he was an evil man .
" people like her , which was the majority , also united .
community groups worked together to ensure that racism could not continue and in that way wolverhampton became ahead of its time .
" i ca n't bring myself to thank enoch powell for that speech , but it was a wake-up call . "

months later his local mp was to make a speech which would spark one of the biggest race debates in uk history .
on the afternoon of 20 april 1968 at the midland hotel , in birmingham , enoch powell addressed the meeting of the conservative political centre .
they were words that would raise ethnic tensions in the west midlands and lead to riots on the streets .
" we were very scared , " said mr mattu .
" my mother and father used to say , ' come straight home from school and if you see a skinhead go straight to someone 's door ' . "
powell spoke of a letter he had received about an elderly widow in that infamous speech mr powell gave apocalyptic-style predictions of what would happen to pockets of britain - such as wolverhampton - if mass immigration continued .
he compared racial tensions in the united states to the roman poet virgil 's description of " the river tiber foaming with much blood " and said anti-discrimination laws were like " throwing a match on to gunpowder " .
with 40 years hindsight , what difference did the speech make ?
the west midlands had been one of the main destinations of immigrants , with people from the commonwealth initially being encouraged to come to work in its many factories .
race card powell , who represented wolverhampton south west , was not the first politician in that era to find himself embroiled in such controversy .
in the 1964 general election campaign in nearby smethwick , supporters of the tory candidate peter griffiths were reported to have circulated the slogan , " if you want a nigger for a neighbour - vote labour " .
the incumbent labour mp patrick gordon walker lost to griffiths in a shock defeat .
it was the race relations act introduced by the labour government in 1968 which prompted powell 's speech .
elias mattu has lived in wolverhampton since he came to the uk he argued it would mean " british " families losing out on matters such as housing , with immigrants being given an unfair advantage .
black sociologist dr clive harris said that playing the race card at that time had proved to have " mileage " for politicians .

bbc rome correspondent david willey , who is travelling with him , will be filing regular reports .
thursday , 17 april , 2008 after pope benedict 's impressive mass for 48,000 at the spanking new nationals baseball stadium - the first non-sporting event held there - i took a couple of hours off in washington 's warm spring sunshine to visit another intriguing new addition to the nation 's capital , the newseum .
it 's the world 's first museum devoted entirely to the history of news and it cost $ 450m .
it opened only last week .
on the façade of the ultra modern steel and glass building situated on pennsylvania avenue only a short distance away from the congress building , is a monster rendering of the first amendment of the american constitution .
metre high lettering spells out the famous text : " congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . "
very apt , i thought , given the religious freedom that the pope has been publicly admiring in america .
how newsworthy , i wondered , is the pope 's visit considered by the american media ?
in the newseum the answer was there right in front of me .
the front page of every daily newspaper published today in all 50 states of this vast country , all the way from hawaii , to alaska , to here in washington , were displayed on the sidewalk in a long line of glass cases .
a quick check revealed that the papal visit and the pontiff 's strong condemnation yesterday -lrb- and again today -rrb- of the scandal of systematic sexual abuse of minors by some american catholic priests , formerly covered up or denied by ecclesiastical authorities , was considered front page news in exactly thirty five american states .
i did a quick tally of the 15 state capitals whose main daily newspaper did not report the pope 's visit or remarks on their front page today .
they included honolulu , alaska , oregon , idaho , kansas and minnesota - all states remote from the hustle and bustle of washington and new york , the only two cities chosen for this papal visit .
most news in american papers is local news - the parish pump mentality endures .
inside the newseum , i saw some news icons of our time : some concrete sections of the berlin wall complete with their original graffiti ; a concrete watch tower from no man 's land between east and west berlin ; a decapitated granite statue of lenin from a remote russian town more than a thousand miles from moscow .
the museum creators would doubtless have liked to transport here the toppled statue of saddam hussein from baghdad if they could have laid their hands on it .
they had to make do with a twisted mass of steel from the top of one of the twin towers in new york .
their catastrophic destruction on 9/11 will be commemorated by pope benedict when he goes to pray at ground zero before he leaves for rome on sunday .
i remarked in my report yesterday on the iconic figure of the pope .
could he too one day be toppled , i mused , thinking about the paedophile priests scandal ?
real news back at the press centre for the papal visit , news was just coming in of an extraordinary unscheduled meeting this afternoon between the pope and six men and women victims of clerical sexual abuse from the boston diocese .
for years the vatican has rejected all attempts by survivors of these criminal acts to meet the pope .
the petitions for the redress of their grievances fell on deaf ears .
today , the pontiff listened carefully to each of their individual horror stories in the private chapel of his temporary residence here , and prayed with them .
the vatican spokesman said some were in tears as they recounted their experiences at the hands of those who had been supposed to be their spiritual guides .
interviewed later on television , one victim , a former altar boy , said he had told the pope that a cancer was eating away at his church .
no fewer than six catholic dioceses in america have had to declare bankruptcy as a result of paying compensation to victims of priestly abuse .
the scandal has already cost the catholic church here over two billion dollars , as well as ruining the lives of over four thousand men and women and inflicting an incalculable wound upon the catholic church 's reputation .
each day for the past three days the pope has publicly repeated his contrition - his mea culpa , his shame - at the scandal which his american bishops have themselves admitted they handled very badly .
it is an astonishing turnaround in vatican policy after years of pretending to ignore the reality .
that really is news .
now we are all off to new york , to united nations headquarters where pope benedict is to deliver the long planned keynote speech of his transatlantic journey .
that also is likely to be news .
watch this space .
wednesday , 16 april , 2008 " that was one heck of a speech , " president george w bush was overheard to remark to pope benedict , after the pontiff had delivered his paean of praise for american moral values and leadership on the lawn at the white house .
they sat there , side by side on a raised dais , the pope and the president , just like two of the iconic figures from one of those colourful early mosaics in the apses of some of rome 's most ancient churches .
" gott bless america , " the pope gutturally declared at the end of his speech .
it was the german pontiff 's 81st birthday .
following the lead of a soprano singer and a marching military band dressed in the colourful uniforms of old colonial times , everyone sang happy birthday .
it was the largest gathering of its kind that the white house had seen in years : 12,000 people altogether .
the pope positively beamed with delight as the president then gently shepherded the shepherd towards the oval office for private discussions on the state of the world .
i would have loved to be a fly on the wall to hear the tone of pope benedict 's remarks to george bush , and the president 's replies as they discussed the collateral effects of the war in iraq , mexican migration into the us , and the moral imperatives of being a superpower for a full 45 minutes .
but we reporters unfortunately are not privy for the moment to gather such gems .
we shall have to wait for the memoirs , or the release of the official record in decades to come .
an early night the pope 's words and his visit have upstaged that of another vip who arrived on wednesday , uk prime minister gordon brown .
mr brown is dining at the british embassy which lies just across the road from the vatican 's embassy , the pope 's temporary residence here .
the pontiff is having a much smaller private dinner at his embassy , with a few close advisers and american friends , and is having an early night in preparation for thursday 's great set piece , a mass for 45,000 faithful in washington 's brand new baseball stadium - the first time it will have been used for a non-sporting event .
meanwhile , the revels continue at the white house , where the president is hosting his gala dinner party in honour of the pope 's visit , the first since that of pope john paul ii , 29 years ago .
among the guests were no fewer than five catholic justices of the supreme court , along with many other national dignitaries .
the pope himself declined to attend this party , on the well-justified grounds that he had a previous important engagement with his cardinals and bishops .
as i write this , he has been berating them for their poor handling of the paedophile priest scandals of recent years .
he lectured the 400 bishops and cardinals gathered in the rather gloomy crypt of the catholic hilltop shrine of the immaculate conception about the proper place of sexuality in human relationships .
what does child protection mean , the pope asked , when pornography and violence can be viewed in so many american homes on television or on the internet ?
he called upon the entertainment and media industries to play their part , as well , in protecting the values which underpin american society .
say what you will , pope benedict has made a big impression in his first 48 hours on us soil .
he has been polite , bold and outspoken , and he has put his finger upon some of the main causes of malaise in contemporary american society .
for while us network tv concentrates on the trivia of the papal visit , such as the exact colour and origin of the pope 's red shoes , benedict himself has a far grander agenda and vision .
pope benedict projects a different sort of image from that of his late predecessor john paul ii , who i remember watching on one his earliest foreign trips , in warsaw in 1979 , on his knees , lost in deep prayer as he was being driven amid cheering crowds , looking for all the world like a vision from some mediaeval painting .
pope benedict is a different sort of icon , but an icon all the same .
tuesday , 15 april , 2008 daily trials all papal trips begin with the collection of the " bible " from the hands of sister giovanna , a dedicated nun who works in the vatican press office and does all the paperwork for the journalists accredited to the holy see .
this essential " bible " for the journey to america -lrb- lose it at your peril -rrb- is a 56-page confidential document - some might call it a crib sheet - containing the detailed movements of pope benedict and his retinue for the next six days , minute by minute , together with the bus departures which are going to take us to and from each venue .
it contains lists of names of all the important people the pope will be seeing over the next six days , useful telephone numbers , what the weather is likely to be , where he will be making his main speech -lrb- at the united nations in new york on friday -rrb- and where to catch the bus for each " pool " .
a " pool " is a selected group of journalists and photographers who cover private papal events where access is limited for logistical or security reasons , and who are supposed to brief their less fortunate colleagues , on what they have seen and heard .
a papal journey is a bit like an obstacle race in which there are a number of daily hurdles to jump over .
the first is to get embargoed copies of the papal speeches which are released at some impossible early hour , usually just before dawn .
with a sigh of relief , i see that we have a lie-in tomorrow morning .
but every other morning , we have a narrow 15-minute window , usually between 0500 and 0515 , to pick up our papal texts before we are cast into an outer circle of ignorance .
the papal charter plane - the americans have already nicknamed it shepherd one - is a boeing 777 belonging to the loss-making italian flag carrier alitalia .
it has embroidered white headrests bearing the papal coat of arms on each seat .
the pope and his private secretary have a special curtained-off section up front .
we hacks all sit in economy class at the back .
new style a news conference takes place as we head out over the atlantic after crossing the french coast .
the pope and his press secretary , a jesuit priest , come aft , and the pope , standing by a bulkhead , answers some questions submitted and vetted in advance .
it is a very different story from the days when i first began my travels with the late pope john paul ii .
he used to walk down the aisles of the plane , chatting freely with us for hours at a time , speaking in seven or eight different languages .
there was a lot of climbing over seats to try to hear what he was saying and comparing of notes afterwards to find out what were his exact words in each language .
pope benedict is different .
his briefings are all much more structured .
he takes only five questions and speaks through a microphone linked to the plane 's public address system .
i record every word in perfect quality .
the good german theology professor does not like disorder around him , and i ca n't say i blame him , remembering the flying tripods and the hectic scrambles of some journalistic encounters on previous papal trips .
now there is a problem with communicating our stories to the outside world .
there is a telephone handset by each seat , but only six satellite calls can be made from the aircraft at any one time .
everyone is swiping credit cards and dialling at the same time and the system crashes .
finally , at my 25th try , i get through to london and can broadcast live on radio and tv what the pope has been speaking about .
you need perseverance to cover papal travels .

very apt , i thought , given the religious freedom that the pope has been publicly admiring in america .
how newsworthy , i wondered , is the pope 's visit considered by the american media ?
in the newseum the answer was there right in front of me .
the front page of every daily newspaper published today in all 50 states of this vast country , all the way from hawaii , to alaska , to here in washington , were displayed on the sidewalk in a long line of glass cases .
washington was awash with papal fans , but the visit made headlines nationwide a quick check revealed that the papal visit and the pontiff 's strong condemnation yesterday -lrb- and again today -rrb- of the scandal of systematic sexual abuse of minors by some american catholic priests , formerly covered up or denied by ecclesiastical authorities , was considered front page news in exactly thirty five american states .
i did a quick tally of the 15 state capitals whose main daily newspaper did not report the pope 's visit or remarks on their front page today .
they included honolulu , alaska , oregon , idaho , kansas and minnesota - all states remote from the hustle and bustle of washington and new york , the only two cities chosen for this papal visit .
most news in american papers is local news - the parish pump mentality endures .
inside the newseum , i saw some news icons of our time : some concrete sections of the berlin wall complete with their original graffiti ; a concrete watch tower from no man 's land between east and west berlin ; a decapitated granite statue of lenin from a remote russian town more than a thousand miles from moscow .
the museum creators would doubtless have liked to transport here the toppled statue of saddam hussein from baghdad if they could have laid their hands on it .
they had to make do with a twisted mass of steel from the top of one of the twin towers in new york .
their catastrophic destruction on 9/11 will be commemorated by pope benedict when he goes to pray at ground zero before he leaves for rome on sunday .
i remarked in my report yesterday on the iconic figure of the pope .
could he too one day be toppled , i mused , thinking about the paedophile priests scandal ?
real news back at the press centre for the papal visit , news was just coming in of an extraordinary unscheduled meeting this afternoon between the pope and six men and women victims of clerical sexual abuse from the boston diocese .
for years the vatican has rejected all attempts by survivors of these criminal acts to meet the pope .
the petitions for the redress of their grievances fell on deaf ears .
today , the pontiff listened carefully to each of their individual horror stories in the private chapel of his temporary residence here , and prayed with them .
the pope will probably pack another famous stadium for mass in new york the vatican spokesman said some were in tears as they recounted their experiences at the hands of those who had been supposed to be their spiritual guides .
interviewed later on television , one victim , a former altar boy , said he had told the pope that a cancer was eating away at his church .
no fewer than six catholic dioceses in america have had to declare bankruptcy as a result of paying compensation to victims of priestly abuse .
the scandal has already cost the catholic church here over two billion dollars , as well as ruining the lives of over four thousand men and women and inflicting an incalculable wound upon the catholic church 's reputation .
each day for the past three days the pope has publicly repeated his contrition - his mea culpa , his shame - at the scandal which his american bishops have themselves admitted they handled very badly .
it is an astonishing turnaround in vatican policy after years of pretending to ignore the reality .
that really is news .
now we are all off to new york , to united nations headquarters where pope benedict is to deliver the long planned keynote speech of his transatlantic journey .
that also is likely to be news .
watch this space .
wednesday , 16 april , 2008 " that was one heck of a speech , " president george w bush was overheard to remark to pope benedict , after the pontiff had delivered his paean of praise for american moral values and leadership on the lawn at the white house .
they sat there , side by side on a raised dais , the pope and the president , just like two of the iconic figures from one of those colourful early mosaics in the apses of some of rome 's most ancient churches .
the pope and the president met privately to discuss world affairs " gott bless america , " the pope gutturally declared at the end of his speech .
it was the german pontiff 's 81st birthday .
following the lead of a soprano singer and a marching military band dressed in the colourful uniforms of old colonial times , everyone sang happy birthday .
it was the largest gathering of its kind that the white house had seen in years : 12,000 people altogether .
the pope positively beamed with delight as the president then gently shepherded the shepherd towards the oval office for private discussions on the state of the world .
i would have loved to be a fly on the wall to hear the tone of pope benedict 's remarks to george bush , and the president 's replies as they discussed the collateral effects of the war in iraq , mexican migration into the us , and the moral imperatives of being a superpower for a full 45 minutes .
but we reporters unfortunately are not privy for the moment to gather such gems .
we shall have to wait for the memoirs , or the release of the official record in decades to come .
an early night the pope 's words and his visit have upstaged that of another vip who arrived on wednesday , uk prime minister gordon brown .
mr brown is dining at the british embassy which lies just across the road from the vatican 's embassy , the pope 's temporary residence here .
the pontiff is having a much smaller private dinner at his embassy , with a few close advisers and american friends , and is having an early night in preparation for thursday 's great set piece , a mass for 45,000 faithful in washington 's brand new baseball stadium - the first time it will have been used for a non-sporting event .
the pontiff berated cardinals and bishops over recent sex scandals meanwhile , the revels continue at the white house , where the president is hosting his gala dinner party in honour of the pope 's visit , the first since that of pope john paul ii , 29 years ago .
among the guests were no fewer than five catholic justices of the supreme court , along with many other national dignitaries .
the pope himself declined to attend this party , on the well-justified grounds that he had a previous important engagement with his cardinals and bishops .
as i write this , he has been berating them for their poor handling of the paedophile priest scandals of recent years .
he lectured the 400 bishops and cardinals gathered in the rather gloomy crypt of the catholic hilltop shrine of the immaculate conception about the proper place of sexuality in human relationships .
what does child protection mean , the pope asked , when pornography and violence can be viewed in so many american homes on television or on the internet ?
he called upon the entertainment and media industries to play their part , as well , in protecting the values which underpin american society .
say what you will , pope benedict has made a big impression in his first 48 hours on us soil .
he has been polite , bold and outspoken , and he has put his finger upon some of the main causes of malaise in contemporary american society .
for while us network tv concentrates on the trivia of the papal visit , such as the exact colour and origin of the pope 's red shoes , benedict himself has a far grander agenda and vision .
pope benedict projects a different sort of image from that of his late predecessor john paul ii , who i remember watching on one his earliest foreign trips , in warsaw in 1979 , on his knees , lost in deep prayer as he was being driven amid cheering crowds , looking for all the world like a vision from some mediaeval painting .
pope benedict is a different sort of icon , but an icon all the same .
tuesday , 15 april , 2008 daily trials all papal trips begin with the collection of the " bible " from the hands of sister giovanna , a dedicated nun who works in the vatican press office and does all the paperwork for the journalists accredited to the holy see .
the pope will be welcomed to the white house on wednesday this essential " bible " for the journey to america -lrb- lose it at your peril -rrb- is a 56-page confidential document - some might call it a crib sheet - containing the detailed movements of pope benedict and his retinue for the next six days , minute by minute , together with the bus departures which are going to take us to and from each venue .
it contains lists of names of all the important people the pope will be seeing over the next six days , useful telephone numbers , what the weather is likely to be , where he will be making his main speech -lrb- at the united nations in new york on friday -rrb- and where to catch the bus for each " pool " .
a " pool " is a selected group of journalists and photographers who cover private papal events where access is limited for logistical or security reasons , and who are supposed to brief their less fortunate colleagues , on what they have seen and heard .
a papal journey is a bit like an obstacle race in which there are a number of daily hurdles to jump over .
the first is to get embargoed copies of the papal speeches which are released at some impossible early hour , usually just before dawn .
bumper stickers and other souvenirs are already on sale with a sigh of relief , i see that we have a lie-in tomorrow morning .
but every other morning , we have a narrow 15-minute window , usually between 0500 and 0515 , to pick up our papal texts before we are cast into an outer circle of ignorance .
the papal charter plane - the americans have already nicknamed it shepherd one - is a boeing 777 belonging to the loss-making italian flag carrier alitalia .
it has embroidered white headrests bearing the papal coat of arms on each seat .
the pope and his private secretary have a special curtained-off section up front .
we hacks all sit in economy class at the back .
new style a news conference takes place as we head out over the atlantic after crossing the french coast .
the pope and his press secretary , a jesuit priest , come aft , and the pope , standing by a bulkhead , answers some questions submitted and vetted in advance .
it is a very different story from the days when i first began my travels with the late pope john paul ii .
he used to walk down the aisles of the plane , chatting freely with us for hours at a time , speaking in seven or eight different languages .
there was a lot of climbing over seats to try to hear what he was saying and comparing of notes afterwards to find out what were his exact words in each language .
pope benedict is different .
his briefings are all much more structured .
he takes only five questions and speaks through a microphone linked to the plane 's public address system .
i record every word in perfect quality .
the good german theology professor does not like disorder around him , and i ca n't say i blame him , remembering the flying tripods and the hectic scrambles of some journalistic encounters on previous papal trips .
now there is a problem with communicating our stories to the outside world .
there is a telephone handset by each seat , but only six satellite calls can be made from the aircraft at any one time .
everyone is swiping credit cards and dialling at the same time and the system crashes .
finally , at my 25th try , i get through to london and can broadcast live on radio and tv what the pope has been speaking about .
you need perseverance to cover papal travels .

thursday , 17 april , 2008 after pope benedict 's impressive mass for 48,000 at the spanking new nationals baseball stadium - the first non-sporting event held there - i took a couple of hours off in washington 's warm spring sunshine to visit another intriguing new addition to the nation 's capital , the newseum .
it 's the world 's first museum devoted entirely to the history of news and it cost $ 450m .
it opened only last week .
on the façade of the ultra modern steel and glass building situated on pennsylvania avenue only a short distance away from the congress building , is a monster rendering of the first amendment of the american constitution .

how newsworthy , i wondered , is the pope 's visit considered by the american media ?
in the newseum the answer was there right in front of me .
the front page of every daily newspaper published today in all 50 states of this vast country , all the way from hawaii , to alaska , to here in washington , were displayed on the sidewalk in a long line of glass cases .
washington was awash with papal fans , but the visit made headlines nationwide a quick check revealed that the papal visit and the pontiff 's strong condemnation yesterday -lrb- and again today -rrb- of the scandal of systematic sexual abuse of minors by some american catholic priests , formerly covered up or denied by ecclesiastical authorities , was considered front page news in exactly thirty five american states .
i did a quick tally of the 15 state capitals whose main daily newspaper did not report the pope 's visit or remarks on their front page today .

most news in american papers is local news - the parish pump mentality endures .
inside the newseum , i saw some news icons of our time : some concrete sections of the berlin wall complete with their original graffiti ; a concrete watch tower from no man 's land between east and west berlin ; a decapitated granite statue of lenin from a remote russian town more than a thousand miles from moscow .
the museum creators would doubtless have liked to transport here the toppled statue of saddam hussein from baghdad if they could have laid their hands on it .
they had to make do with a twisted mass of steel from the top of one of the twin towers in new york .
their catastrophic destruction on 9/11 will be commemorated by pope benedict when he goes to pray at ground zero before he leaves for rome on sunday .
i remarked in my report yesterday on the iconic figure of the pope .

no fewer than six catholic dioceses in america have had to declare bankruptcy as a result of paying compensation to victims of priestly abuse .

now we are all off to new york , to united nations headquarters where pope benedict is to deliver the long planned keynote speech of his transatlantic journey .
that also is likely to be news .
watch this space .
wednesday , 16 april , 2008 " that was one heck of a speech , " president george w bush was overheard to remark to pope benedict , after the pontiff had delivered his paean of praise for american moral values and leadership on the lawn at the white house .
they sat there , side by side on a raised dais , the pope and the president , just like two of the iconic figures from one of those colourful early mosaics in the apses of some of rome 's most ancient churches .
the pope and the president met privately to discuss world affairs " gott bless america , " the pope gutturally declared at the end of his speech .
it was the german pontiff 's 81st birthday .
following the lead of a soprano singer and a marching military band dressed in the colourful uniforms of old colonial times , everyone sang happy birthday .
it was the largest gathering of its kind that the white house had seen in years : 12,000 people altogether .
the pope positively beamed with delight as the president then gently shepherded the shepherd towards the oval office for private discussions on the state of the world .
i would have loved to be a fly on the wall to hear the tone of pope benedict 's remarks to george bush , and the president 's replies as they discussed the collateral effects of the war in iraq , mexican migration into the us , and the moral imperatives of being a superpower for a full 45 minutes .
but we reporters unfortunately are not privy for the moment to gather such gems .
we shall have to wait for the memoirs , or the release of the official record in decades to come .
an early night the pope 's words and his visit have upstaged that of another vip who arrived on wednesday , uk prime minister gordon brown .
mr brown is dining at the british embassy which lies just across the road from the vatican 's embassy , the pope 's temporary residence here .
the pontiff is having a much smaller private dinner at his embassy , with a few close advisers and american friends , and is having an early night in preparation for thursday 's great set piece , a mass for 45,000 faithful in washington 's brand new baseball stadium - the first time it will have been used for a non-sporting event .
the pontiff berated cardinals and bishops over recent sex scandals meanwhile , the revels continue at the white house , where the president is hosting his gala dinner party in honour of the pope 's visit , the first since that of pope john paul ii , 29 years ago .
among the guests were no fewer than five catholic justices of the supreme court , along with many other national dignitaries .
the pope himself declined to attend this party , on the well-justified grounds that he had a previous important engagement with his cardinals and bishops .
as i write this , he has been berating them for their poor handling of the paedophile priest scandals of recent years .
he lectured the 400 bishops and cardinals gathered in the rather gloomy crypt of the catholic hilltop shrine of the immaculate conception about the proper place of sexuality in human relationships .
what does child protection mean , the pope asked , when pornography and violence can be viewed in so many american homes on television or on the internet ?
he called upon the entertainment and media industries to play their part , as well , in protecting the values which underpin american society .
say what you will , pope benedict has made a big impression in his first 48 hours on us soil .
he has been polite , bold and outspoken , and he has put his finger upon some of the main causes of malaise in contemporary american society .
for while us network tv concentrates on the trivia of the papal visit , such as the exact colour and origin of the pope 's red shoes , benedict himself has a far grander agenda and vision .
pope benedict projects a different sort of image from that of his late predecessor john paul ii , who i remember watching on one his earliest foreign trips , in warsaw in 1979 , on his knees , lost in deep prayer as he was being driven amid cheering crowds , looking for all the world like a vision from some mediaeval painting .
pope benedict is a different sort of icon , but an icon all the same .
tuesday , 15 april , 2008 daily trials all papal trips begin with the collection of the " bible " from the hands of sister giovanna , a dedicated nun who works in the vatican press office and does all the paperwork for the journalists accredited to the holy see .
the pope will be welcomed to the white house on wednesday this essential " bible " for the journey to america -lrb- lose it at your peril -rrb- is a 56-page confidential document - some might call it a crib sheet - containing the detailed movements of pope benedict and his retinue for the next six days , minute by minute , together with the bus departures which are going to take us to and from each venue .
it contains lists of names of all the important people the pope will be seeing over the next six days , useful telephone numbers , what the weather is likely to be , where he will be making his main speech -lrb- at the united nations in new york on friday -rrb- and where to catch the bus for each " pool " .
a " pool " is a selected group of journalists and photographers who cover private papal events where access is limited for logistical or security reasons , and who are supposed to brief their less fortunate colleagues , on what they have seen and heard .
a papal journey is a bit like an obstacle race in which there are a number of daily hurdles to jump over .
the first is to get embargoed copies of the papal speeches which are released at some impossible early hour , usually just before dawn .
bumper stickers and other souvenirs are already on sale with a sigh of relief , i see that we have a lie-in tomorrow morning .
but every other morning , we have a narrow 15-minute window , usually between 0500 and 0515 , to pick up our papal texts before we are cast into an outer circle of ignorance .
the papal charter plane - the americans have already nicknamed it shepherd one - is a boeing 777 belonging to the loss-making italian flag carrier alitalia .
it has embroidered white headrests bearing the papal coat of arms on each seat .
the pope and his private secretary have a special curtained-off section up front .
we hacks all sit in economy class at the back .
new style a news conference takes place as we head out over the atlantic after crossing the french coast .
the pope and his press secretary , a jesuit priest , come aft , and the pope , standing by a bulkhead , answers some questions submitted and vetted in advance .
it is a very different story from the days when i first began my travels with the late pope john paul ii .
he used to walk down the aisles of the plane , chatting freely with us for hours at a time , speaking in seven or eight different languages .
there was a lot of climbing over seats to try to hear what he was saying and comparing of notes afterwards to find out what were his exact words in each language .
pope benedict is different .
his briefings are all much more structured .
he takes only five questions and speaks through a microphone linked to the plane 's public address system .
i record every word in perfect quality .
the good german theology professor does not like disorder around him , and i ca n't say i blame him , remembering the flying tripods and the hectic scrambles of some journalistic encounters on previous papal trips .
now there is a problem with communicating our stories to the outside world .
there is a telephone handset by each seat , but only six satellite calls can be made from the aircraft at any one time .
everyone is swiping credit cards and dialling at the same time and the system crashes .
finally , at my 25th try , i get through to london and can broadcast live on radio and tv what the pope has been speaking about .
you need perseverance to cover papal travels .

bbc rome correspondent david willey , who is travelling with him , will be filing regular reports .
thursday , 17 april , 2008 after pope benedict 's impressive mass for 48,000 at the spanking new nationals baseball stadium - the first non-sporting event held there - i took a couple of hours off in washington 's warm spring sunshine to visit another intriguing new addition to the nation 's capital , the newseum .
it 's the world 's first museum devoted entirely to the history of news and it cost $ 450m .
it opened only last week .
on the façade of the ultra modern steel and glass building situated on pennsylvania avenue only a short distance away from the congress building , is a monster rendering of the first amendment of the american constitution .
metre high lettering spells out the famous text : " congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . "
very apt , i thought , given the religious freedom that the pope has been publicly admiring in america .
how newsworthy , i wondered , is the pope 's visit considered by the american media ?
in the newseum the answer was there right in front of me .
the front page of every daily newspaper published today in all 50 states of this vast country , all the way from hawaii , to alaska , to here in washington , were displayed on the sidewalk in a long line of glass cases .
washington was awash with papal fans , but the visit made headlines nationwide a quick check revealed that the papal visit and the pontiff 's strong condemnation yesterday -lrb- and again today -rrb- of the scandal of systematic sexual abuse of minors by some american catholic priests , formerly covered up or denied by ecclesiastical authorities , was considered front page news in exactly thirty five american states .
i did a quick tally of the 15 state capitals whose main daily newspaper did not report the pope 's visit or remarks on their front page today .
they included honolulu , alaska , oregon , idaho , kansas and minnesota - all states remote from the hustle and bustle of washington and new york , the only two cities chosen for this papal visit .
most news in american papers is local news - the parish pump mentality endures .
inside the newseum , i saw some news icons of our time : some concrete sections of the berlin wall complete with their original graffiti ; a concrete watch tower from no man 's land between east and west berlin ; a decapitated granite statue of lenin from a remote russian town more than a thousand miles from moscow .
the museum creators would doubtless have liked to transport here the toppled statue of saddam hussein from baghdad if they could have laid their hands on it .
they had to make do with a twisted mass of steel from the top of one of the twin towers in new york .
their catastrophic destruction on 9/11 will be commemorated by pope benedict when he goes to pray at ground zero before he leaves for rome on sunday .
i remarked in my report yesterday on the iconic figure of the pope .
could he too one day be toppled , i mused , thinking about the paedophile priests scandal ?
real news back at the press centre for the papal visit , news was just coming in of an extraordinary unscheduled meeting this afternoon between the pope and six men and women victims of clerical sexual abuse from the boston diocese .
for years the vatican has rejected all attempts by survivors of these criminal acts to meet the pope .
the petitions for the redress of their grievances fell on deaf ears .
today , the pontiff listened carefully to each of their individual horror stories in the private chapel of his temporary residence here , and prayed with them .
the pope will probably pack another famous stadium for mass in new york the vatican spokesman said some were in tears as they recounted their experiences at the hands of those who had been supposed to be their spiritual guides .
interviewed later on television , one victim , a former altar boy , said he had told the pope that a cancer was eating away at his church .
no fewer than six catholic dioceses in america have had to declare bankruptcy as a result of paying compensation to victims of priestly abuse .
the scandal has already cost the catholic church here over two billion dollars , as well as ruining the lives of over four thousand men and women and inflicting an incalculable wound upon the catholic church 's reputation .
each day for the past three days the pope has publicly repeated his contrition - his mea culpa , his shame - at the scandal which his american bishops have themselves admitted they handled very badly .
it is an astonishing turnaround in vatican policy after years of pretending to ignore the reality .
that really is news .
now we are all off to new york , to united nations headquarters where pope benedict is to deliver the long planned keynote speech of his transatlantic journey .
that also is likely to be news .

defeat against notts county on saturday will mean relegation from the league , which they have been in since 1921 .
last year , the club clinched victory in the last game of the season to avoid relegation , and in recent years have battled back from administration .
but now , nine points from safety at the bottom of the table , even die-hard fans think relegation is unavoidable .
among them are neil cooke , 56 , and his father neville , 81 , who together have clocked up 101 years working on the racecourse 's turnstiles .
mr cooke jnr said : " i 'm not as devastated as some people because i 've been to a lot of away games and could see the writing has been on the wall for many , many weeks .
there 's a stigma attached to towns that lose their league clubs ... they can be dark , miserable places lindsay jones , wrexham supporters ' trust " there 's absolutely no way the team will stay up .

" wrexham is known for its football team .

he said fans now wanted to know : " what 's the plan for the future ? "
while many fans accept relegation looms , it has yet to be seen what effect life without a team in the football league will have on the town .
morale dave roberts , membership manager with the chamber of commerce for chester , ellesmere port and north wales , said it was impossible to quantify how much business wrexham fc fans bring to the town .
but he added : " there must be some kind of spend from the football fans , or perhaps the wives that come in and go shopping .
" but it will definitely be a sad day for wrexham -lsb- if they are relegated -rsb- , and it could affect the morale of the people of wrexham . "
mr roberts said having a team in the football league can boost a town 's profile .
he added : " it 's a bit like accrington stanley - many people elsewhere in the country might not have been to wrexham , but they 've heard of it because of the football results . "
wrexham council declined to comment on the effect of relegation on the town .
flintshire-based commercial finance firm lease direct currently has a deal to continue as the club 's sponsors next season .
the company said it hoped to make a " positive " statement next week .

i have no hope at all .
my father has also been saying for a long time that the team wo n't survive this season . "
he added : " it has been demoralising .
as a turnstile steward i feel sorry for the people that have come to watch the dross the team has produced this season .
" but we will live to fight another day and i think we will bounce back .
" the ground is still there and we have good management for next year - brian little just had a rusty bag of tools to work with this year . "
lindsay jones , a board member of wrexham supporters ' trust , said he was " very resigned " to the team going down .
he added : " there 's a stigma attached to towns that lose their league clubs .
they can be dark , miserable places .
" it 's a massive blow to the town .
" wrexham is known for its football team .
every saturday afternoon we 're on the telly . "
he said fans now wanted to know : " what 's the plan for the future ? "
while many fans accept relegation looms , it has yet to be seen what effect life without a team in the football league will have on the town .
morale dave roberts , membership manager with the chamber of commerce for chester , ellesmere port and north wales , said it was impossible to quantify how much business wrexham fc fans bring to the town .
but he added : " there must be some kind of spend from the football fans , or perhaps the wives that come in and go shopping .
" but it will definitely be a sad day for wrexham -lsb- if they are relegated -rsb- , and it could affect the morale of the people of wrexham . "
mr roberts said having a team in the football league can boost a town 's profile .
he added : " it 's a bit like accrington stanley - many people elsewhere in the country might not have been to wrexham , but they 've heard of it because of the football results . "
wrexham council declined to comment on the effect of relegation on the town .
flintshire-based commercial finance firm lease direct currently has a deal to continue as the club 's sponsors next season .
the company said it hoped to make a " positive " statement next week .

amd lost $ 358m -lrb- £ 180m -rrb- between january and march , even though sales were up 22 % on the same period a year ago .
the firm had warned recently that sales were weak across all product lines .
amd 's fortunes are in stark contrast with that of intel and other tech companies , which have reported robust earnings in recent weeks .

ms sturgeon - who signed up with the snp at 16 - stuck with the party through good times and bad , climbing the ranks to become scotland 's deputy first minister and health secretary .
the former solicitor 's direct style earned her the title of " nippy sweetie " early on , but has attributed her attitude to the seriousness with which she approaches her job .
entering holyrood as a glasgow list msp in 1999 , ms sturgeon , born in irvine in 1970 , pulled off her key aim of winning the labour-held seat of govan in 2007 , after cutting the party 's majority over several attempts at uk and scottish elections .
as snp education spokeswoman , she held the labour / lib dem administration to account over the damaging fiasco which saw thousands of higher exam results delayed or sent out incorrectly .
ms sturgeon strongly attacked the use of private firm reliance for prisoner escorts during her time with the justice brief , following the escape of convicted killer james mccormick from hamilton sheriff court .
and she accused scotland 's senior law officer , then lord advocate colin boyd , of talking " a load of rubbish " over his support for uk government plans for a new supreme court to hear scottish civil case appeals .

the scottish finance secretary 's approach to steering the nationalists ' first budget through tough opposition almost made the troubles which hit the party during his leadership seem a dim and distant memory .
as well as his profile in government , mr swinney is also a popular figure in his tayside north constituency , where despite his tag as " minister for everything " , he finds time to attend numerous events from art gallery openings to coffee mornings .
seen as one of the snp 's key thinkers and strategists , the former mp joined the party at just 15 , and was elected national secretary in his early 20s , at a time of organisational turmoil , prompted by heavy losses in the 1979 uk election .
born in edinburgh in 1964 , the politics graduate pursued a career in scotland 's financial sector before entering parliament , latterly working as a strategic planning principal with scottish amicable .
elected deputy snp leader in december 1998 , mr swinney was credited , along with alex salmond , for taking a business-friendly approach to economic policy while encouraging a broad approach to encompass " middle scotland " .
the pro-european also drafted the " penny for scotland " policy , by which the nationalists promised to reverse for scotland alone a uk tax cut of 1 % on the basic rate and to divert the cash to social need - a plan which was later abandoned .
' ducking responsibility ' when devolution happened , mr swinney was aware of the danger that the new parliament would block the road to independence but , publicly , described devolution as " the greatest mistake the unionists ever made " .
he succeeded mr salmond as snp leader , in 2000 , having expressed a desire to " reconnect " with grassroots activists - but it was one of those activists which led the party into one of its darkest eras in recent times .
at first minister 's question time , one of mr swinney 's favoured tactics was to unleash a barrage of statistical information at his opponent and , while the approach had some effect , critics said he lacked the bite to be an effective leader .
he masterminded one of the snp 's slickest election campaigns in the 2003 holyrood poll , but , later that year , little-known glasgow snp activist bill wilson challenged mr swinney for the leadership , accusing him of ducking responsibility for a " plummeting " snp vote .
mr swinney won a decisive victory over dr wilson - who became an msp in 2007 - but the contest itself , brought by an unelected activist with little chance of winning , was publicly damaging .
the situation inside parliament was little better , where nationalist msps , bruce mcfee and adam ingram declared that they would not support mr swinney in a leadership ballot amid claims he had watered down the commitment to independence .
another , campbell martin , was flung out of the party after bosses found his criticism of the swinney leadership damaged its interests in the run-up to the snp 's poor european election showing in 2004 , where it failed to overtake labour . "
after a four-year reign , mr swinney quit the leadership , accepting responsibility for failing to sell the party 's message " eventually , after a four-year reign , mr swinney quit the leadership , accepting responsibility for failing to sell the party 's message - but warned snp members not to underestimate the damage caused by " the loose and dangerous talk of the few " .
the snp 's election win allowed mr swinney to put that period firmly behind him with his appointment as the most powerful of the salmond administration 's cabinet secretaries .
holding the finance portfolio , the opposition brief he took on in 2005 , allowed him to concentrate on what he was best at , and he was widely seen as having played a blinder in enabling the passage of the snp budget .
with the minority government in need of opposition votes to pass the spending plans , in which mr swinney allocated practically every penny of available cash , he announced several last-minute concessions , including boosting police recruitment , while declaring the uk treasury settlement to be the tightest ever .
predicting a tight vote , he also agreed to boost climate change funding to attract the two green votes - they eventually abstained - and the prospect of special capital funding status for edinburgh to tickle the fancy of lothian independent margo macdonald .
mr swinney latterly turned to plans for replacing council tax with a local income tax , having convinced local authorities to sign up to a new concordat .
the agreement gave them the money to freeze council tax and spend more freely on a commitment to deliver efficiency savings .
amid a lack of parliamentary support for the local income tax and a more low-key launch for the policy compared to that on the " national conversation " on the constitution , critics have questioned mr swinney 's commitment to making it happen .

the scottish finance secretary 's approach to steering the nationalists ' first budget through tough opposition almost made the troubles which hit the party during his leadership seem a dim and distant memory .
as well as his profile in government , mr swinney is also a popular figure in his tayside north constituency , where despite his tag as " minister for everything " , he finds time to attend numerous events from art gallery openings to coffee mornings .
seen as one of the snp 's key thinkers and strategists , the former mp joined the party at just 15 , and was elected national secretary in his early 20s , at a time of organisational turmoil , prompted by heavy losses in the 1979 uk election .
born in edinburgh in 1964 , the politics graduate pursued a career in scotland 's financial sector before entering parliament , latterly working as a strategic planning principal with scottish amicable .
elected deputy snp leader in december 1998 , mr swinney was credited , along with alex salmond , for taking a business-friendly approach to economic policy while encouraging a broad approach to encompass " middle scotland " .
the pro-european also drafted the " penny for scotland " policy , by which the nationalists promised to reverse for scotland alone a uk tax cut of 1 % on the basic rate and to divert the cash to social need - a plan which was later abandoned .
' ducking responsibility ' when devolution happened , mr swinney was aware of the danger that the new parliament would block the road to independence but , publicly , described devolution as " the greatest mistake the unionists ever made " .
he succeeded mr salmond as snp leader , in 2000 , having expressed a desire to " reconnect " with grassroots activists - but it was one of those activists which led the party into one of its darkest eras in recent times .
at first minister 's question time , one of mr swinney 's favoured tactics was to unleash a barrage of statistical information at his opponent and , while the approach had some effect , critics said he lacked the bite to be an effective leader .
he masterminded one of the snp 's slickest election campaigns in the 2003 holyrood poll , but , later that year , little-known glasgow snp activist bill wilson challenged mr swinney for the leadership , accusing him of ducking responsibility for a " plummeting " snp vote .
mr swinney won a decisive victory over dr wilson - who became an msp in 2007 - but the contest itself , brought by an unelected activist with little chance of winning , was publicly damaging .
the situation inside parliament was little better , where nationalist msps , bruce mcfee and adam ingram declared that they would not support mr swinney in a leadership ballot amid claims he had watered down the commitment to independence .
another , campbell martin , was flung out of the party after bosses found his criticism of the swinney leadership damaged its interests in the run-up to the snp 's poor european election showing in 2004 , where it failed to overtake labour .
after a four-year reign , mr swinney quit the leadership , accepting responsibility for failing to sell the party 's message eventually , after a four-year reign , mr swinney quit the leadership , accepting responsibility for failing to sell the party 's message - but warned snp members not to underestimate the damage caused by " the loose and dangerous talk of the few " .
the snp 's election win allowed mr swinney to put that period firmly behind him with his appointment as the most powerful of the salmond administration 's cabinet secretaries .
holding the finance portfolio , the opposition brief he took on in 2005 , allowed him to concentrate on what he was best at , and he was widely seen as having played a blinder in enabling the passage of the snp budget .
with the minority government in need of opposition votes to pass the spending plans , in which mr swinney allocated practically every penny of available cash , he announced several last-minute concessions , including boosting police recruitment , while declaring the uk treasury settlement to be the tightest ever .
predicting a tight vote , he also agreed to boost climate change funding to attract the two green votes - they eventually abstained - and the prospect of special capital funding status for edinburgh to tickle the fancy of lothian independent margo macdonald .
mr swinney latterly turned to plans for replacing council tax with a local income tax , having convinced local authorities to sign up to a new concordat .
the agreement gave them the money to freeze council tax and spend more freely on a commitment to deliver efficiency savings .
amid a lack of parliamentary support for the local income tax and a more low-key launch for the policy compared to that on the " national conversation " on the constitution , critics have questioned mr swinney 's commitment to making it happen .

the situation inside parliament was little better , where nationalist msps , bruce mcfee and adam ingram declared that they would not support mr swinney in a leadership ballot amid claims he had watered down the commitment to independence .
another , campbell martin , was flung out of the party after bosses found his criticism of the swinney leadership damaged its interests in the run-up to the snp 's poor european election showing in 2004 , where it failed to overtake labour .
after a four-year reign , mr swinney quit the leadership , accepting responsibility for failing to sell the party 's message eventually , after a four-year reign , mr swinney quit the leadership , accepting responsibility for failing to sell the party 's message - but warned snp members not to underestimate the damage caused by " the loose and dangerous talk of the few " .
the snp 's election win allowed mr swinney to put that period firmly behind him with his appointment as the most powerful of the salmond administration 's cabinet secretaries .
holding the finance portfolio , the opposition brief he took on in 2005 , allowed him to concentrate on what he was best at , and he was widely seen as having played a blinder in enabling the passage of the snp budget .
with the minority government in need of opposition votes to pass the spending plans , in which mr swinney allocated practically every penny of available cash , he announced several last-minute concessions , including boosting police recruitment , while declaring the uk treasury settlement to be the tightest ever .
predicting a tight vote , he also agreed to boost climate change funding to attract the two green votes - they eventually abstained - and the prospect of special capital funding status for edinburgh to tickle the fancy of lothian independent margo macdonald .
mr swinney latterly turned to plans for replacing council tax with a local income tax , having convinced local authorities to sign up to a new concordat .
the agreement gave them the money to freeze council tax and spend more freely on a commitment to deliver efficiency savings .
amid a lack of parliamentary support for the local income tax and a more low-key launch for the policy compared to that on the " national conversation " on the constitution , critics have questioned mr swinney 's commitment to making it happen .

ms sturgeon - who signed up with the snp at 16 - stuck with the party through good times and bad , climbing the ranks to become scotland 's deputy first minister and health secretary .
the former solicitor 's direct style earned her the title of " nippy sweetie " early on , but has attributed her attitude to the seriousness with which she approaches her job .
entering holyrood as a glasgow list msp in 1999 , ms sturgeon , born in irvine in 1970 , pulled off her key aim of winning the labour-held seat of govan in 2007 , after cutting the party 's majority over several attempts at uk and scottish elections .
as snp education spokeswoman , she held the labour / lib dem administration to account over the damaging fiasco which saw thousands of higher exam results delayed or sent out incorrectly .
ms sturgeon strongly attacked the use of private firm reliance for prisoner escorts during her time with the justice brief , following the escape of convicted killer james mccormick from hamilton sheriff court .

following the snp 's historic election win in may 2007 , ms sturgeon was appointed health secretary and , unlike some of her other cabinet colleagues , had the luxury of being able to enact some of the more popular nationalist pledges - several of which had been ruled out by the previous government .
she reversed the decision to close casualty units at ayr hospital and monklands , in lanarkshire , and announced the scrapping of prescription charges , though not the election pledge to immediately drop them for the chronically ill and those with cancer .
ms sturgeon also outlined a guaranteed 18-week wait for patients after they had seen their gp and vowed to do away with deferred or " hidden " waiting lists .
she ordered a review of the thorny issue of hospital car parking charges - as high as £ 7 in some areas - and , after years of campaigning in opposition , found herself in a position to announce an inquiry into the infection of nhs patients with hepatitis c and hiv from tainted blood products .

the move came after a local plastic surgeon told one patient she was being removed from the list as bosses were struggling to meet government waiting time targets - comments he later withdrew in a nhs statement .

since the snp 's election victory , she has been at the sharp end of repeated attacks claiming she 's dropped manifesto pledges including dumping student debt and cutting class sizes .
rather than withering under pressure , she has battered on and worked to resolve the concerns , while stressing the tight financial settlement from the uk treasury meant tough choices had to be made .
ms hyslop , described as john swinney 's " right hand woman " during his time as snp leader , took to full-time politics following a marketing career in the financial services industry .
her association with the nationalists began in 1986 and she stood both as a councillor and mp on a number of occasions , before entering holyrood in 1999 as a lothian list msp .
in the first parliament , the married mother-of-three , who grew up in ayrshire , served on holyrood 's social justice committee , and is a former snp parliamentary business manager .
as snp education spokeswoman , she urged scottish mps to vote down the uk government 's higher education legislation which brought in controversial top-up tuition fees .
and she scored an early hit against the first labour / lib dem administration after her queries about unemployment figures resulted in the admission that some of the stats were based on newspaper reports .
ms hyslop came under pressure to say whether the manifesto commitment to scrap student debt would be delivered she branded a decision by universities to dock the wages of striking lecturers during the 2006 pay dispute " inflammatory " .
the row centred on claims academic pay had fallen in real terms - an accusation which would be levelled at the future education secretary on overall university funding .
ms hyslop also made repeated calls on holyrood ministers to help end the long-term detention of immigrant children in removal centres , such as dungavel in lanarkshire , a cause she took up with the home office once becoming a minister herself .
in government , she also brought forward another of her long-term aims , to extend free school meals in deprived areas .
ms hyslop saw an opportunity to get the 2007 holyrood election campaign off to a good start after the out-going administration dropped a pledge to cut some secondary class sizes - an issue over which she has found herself in hot water in government .
she contested the snp target seat of linlithgow but failed to take it from labour and returned to holyrood as a list msp .
shortly after the snp 's win at the polls , she indicated the government may not be able to deliver the pledge to cut class sizes in p1-3 to a maximum of 18 .
rescue package after weeks of sustained opposition pressure , ministers gave it the thumbs-up , although the policy lacked a clear delivery target and was uncosted in the budget document .
the government was also defeated in a parliamentary vote when opposition parties rejected its skills strategy - which included the merger of agencies careers scotland and learndirect scotland .
ms hyslop came under further pressure to say whether another manifesto commitment , to scrap student debt , would be delivered and fended off claims the budget had short-changed scotland 's universities , flatly denying accusations the deal amounted to a cut in funding .
but , under pressure from university leaders , ms hyslop set up a taskforce , which resulted in an extra £ 10m being earmarked .
in a similar vein , the education secretary also headed off proposals by western isles councillors to close 11 schools , which resulted in a compromise .
and she announced a £ 1.5m rescue package , allowing glasgow university to reopen admission to undergraduates at its crichton campus in south scotland .
ms hyslop also won credit for honouring a pledge to scrap the £ 2,289 student graduate endowment fee .
more recently she embarked on a fact-finding trip to china under pressure to cancel the trip amid the troubles in tibet , but still took the opportunity to raise the country 's human rights record .

his feat in holding onto the seat of moray for the snp with an increased and comfortable majority in a by-election a year before scottish voters went to the polls in may 2007 was held up as an example of things to come .
that same by-election saw labour slump to fourth .
born in paisley in 1969 , mr lochhead , who first entered parliament as a north east list msp , previously worked as an economic development officer for dundee city council .
seen as something of a protege of alex salmond , he worked as the future first minister 's office manager from 1994-98 , during which time he fought in local and national elections .
as snp fisheries spokesman in the scottish parliament , mr lochhead worked to ensure his party had a strong voice in europe during a time of great uncertainty for the industry .
he helped inflict the first holyrood defeat on the labour / lib dem government over its proposals to help fishermen , after seizing on their angry response to ministers ' refusal to compensate skippers who agreed to a voluntary tie-up .
the married father-of-one also found time to raise issues of concern in his north east patch . "
mr lochhead has continued to find himself a target for some of his more acid-tongued political opponents " he called for a probe after discovering a quarter of equipment in grampian hospitals should have been replaced and raised concern about the cost to scotland of monitoring notorious sex offender steven beech , who had moved to aberdeenshire from england .
he also , in 2004 , attempted to block the sale of a house built at the reputed birthplace of scots hero and outlaw rob roy macgregor and also found time to brand rail timetables " barmy " .
in early 2006 , mr lochhead was named as the snp candidate to defend the moray seat at holyrood the following year after the sitting msp , margaret ewing , decided to step down .
in the selection contest he beat mrs ewing 's sister-in-law , annabelle , who was in need of a comeback after failing to be re-elected as an mp .
this move also allowed mr salmond an almost guaranteed return to the scottish parliament at the top of the north east list .
following margaret ewing 's death at the age of 60 after a long illness , mr lochhead was required to step up sooner than expected .
and so commenced a bitterly-fought by-election campaign , during which conservative candidate mary scanlon 's claim to be the " natural successor " to the late mrs ewing caused offence within the snp .
following his appointment as environment secretary , mr lochhead began courting the scottish fisherman 's federation , offering to involve the body more closely with government , winning its support at the next eu talks in return .
' slavish loyalty ' his first major test came when the foot and mouth crisis required him to work closely with his uk counterparts on restrictions , while only a few months into the job .
there were still brushes with westminster ministers though , when he criticised plans not to devolve offshore marine control to scotland and demanded powers to be able to block controversial plans for ship-to-ship oil transfers in the firth of forth .
mr lochhead also broke ranks with the uk government after ruling out the deep burial of nuclear waste in scotland .
despite his elevated status , he has continued to find himself a target for some of his more acid-tongued political opponents .
during a holyrood debate on the government 's ministerial appointments , tory deputy leader murdo fraser put forward an amendment to have mr lochhead " deleted " .
mr fraser told parliament : " he has had his reward for years of slavish loyalty to his leader and we wish him well . "

seen as something of a protege of alex salmond , he worked as the future first minister 's office manager from 1994-98 , during which time he fought in local and national elections .
as snp fisheries spokesman in the scottish parliament , mr lochhead worked to ensure his party had a strong voice in europe during a time of great uncertainty for the industry .
he helped inflict the first holyrood defeat on the labour / lib dem government over its proposals to help fishermen , after seizing on their angry response to ministers ' refusal to compensate skippers who agreed to a voluntary tie-up .
the married father-of-one also found time to raise issues of concern in his north east patch .
mr lochhead has continued to find himself a target for some of his more acid-tongued political opponents he called for a probe after discovering a quarter of equipment in grampian hospitals should have been replaced and raised concern about the cost to scotland of monitoring notorious sex offender steven beech , who had moved to aberdeenshire from england .
he also , in 2004 , attempted to block the sale of a house built at the reputed birthplace of scots hero and outlaw rob roy macgregor and also found time to brand rail timetables " barmy " .
in early 2006 , mr lochhead was named as the snp candidate to defend the moray seat at holyrood the following year after the sitting msp , margaret ewing , decided to step down .
in the selection contest he beat mrs ewing 's sister-in-law , annabelle , who was in need of a comeback after failing to be re-elected as an mp .
this move also allowed mr salmond an almost guaranteed return to the scottish parliament at the top of the north east list .
following margaret ewing 's death at the age of 60 after a long illness , mr lochhead was required to step up sooner than expected .
and so commenced a bitterly-fought by-election campaign , during which conservative candidate mary scanlon 's claim to be the " natural successor " to the late mrs ewing caused offence within the snp .
following his appointment as environment secretary , mr lochhead began courting the scottish fisherman 's federation , offering to involve the body more closely with government , winning its support at the next eu talks in return .
' slavish loyalty ' his first major test came when the foot and mouth crisis required him to work closely with his uk counterparts on restrictions , while only a few months into the job .
there were still brushes with westminster ministers though , when he criticised plans not to devolve offshore marine control to scotland and demanded powers to be able to block controversial plans for ship-to-ship oil transfers in the firth of forth .
mr lochhead also broke ranks with the uk government after ruling out the deep burial of nuclear waste in scotland .
despite his elevated status , he has continued to find himself a target for some of his more acid-tongued political opponents .
during a holyrood debate on the government 's ministerial appointments , tory deputy leader murdo fraser put forward an amendment to have mr lochhead " deleted " .
mr fraser told parliament : " he has had his reward for years of slavish loyalty to his leader and we wish him well . "

the fears were expressed in a response to the government 's national planning framework .
the council said it was concerned the development at the former steel works was getting less recognition than other projects , such as the clyde gateway .
a government spokesman said ravenscraig was a key economic priority .
local authorities were invited to submit their responses to the national planning framework , which sets out the government 's strategy for development in scotland until 2025 .
attracting investment will become increasingly difficult if ravenscraig is not given the same level of recognition as other major developments jim fitzsimons ravenscraig ltd the consultation closed earlier this week .
a report by north lanarkshire council said it welcomed the government 's commitment to fostering links between glasgow and edinburgh and the surrounding areas , but was concerned about ravenscraig .
it said : " there are concerns that the national planning framework does not give sufficient recognition to the ravenscraig , motherwell , wishaw initiative , particularly in comparison to the emphasis given elsewhere , most notably the clyde gateway . "
fears were also expressed about how the framework would influence future investment in the project .
but a government spokesman said ravenscraig was a priority .
he said : " the draft national planning framework recognises that ravenscraig is a key location for regeneration in north lanarkshire which can provide new economic opportunities and improve the quality of the lanarkshire environment . "
' delivering benefits ' jim fitzsimons , director at ravenscraig ltd , said he echoed the council 's concerns .
he said : " a project of this size and complexity requires significant private and public sector investment in order to realise its potential .
" attracting this investment will become increasingly difficult if ravenscraig is not given the same level of recognition as other major development initiatives and is not dealt with in a consistent manner over the course of its development .
" this is a project which will deliver major benefits for lanarkshire and scotland in terms of new jobs , investment and quality of life .
it is vital it is made a priority , which will allow us to begin delivering these benefits . "
the fears come against a backdrop of uncertainty about how the ravenscraig development will be affected by the government 's shake-up of scottish enterprise .
scottish enterprise lanarkshire had been driving the regeneration project , but discussions are ongoing between the government , scottish enterprise and cosla , which represents local authorities , on how this should move forward after the local agencies were scrapped .
a scottish enterprise spokeswoman said a decision was due to be made soon .
the final national planning framework is expected to published in the winter of 2008 .
