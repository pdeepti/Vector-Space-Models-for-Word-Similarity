observers say the election was fairer than previous polls but still flawed . the georgian election commission said friday , may 23 , that pro-western president mikhail saakashvili 's united national movement won the parliamentary polls this week with 59.5 percent of the vote - trailed by the united opposition council with 17.7 percent .
the party won 120 of 150 parliamentary seats assigned by constituency and a crushing majority of the other half of the seats , allocated proportionally according to the national vote , the electoral commission said .
rigged but the opposition said the poll had been rigged and threatened protests and a parliamentary boycott .
" these elections do n't reflect the people 's choice and the people 's will .
we are not recognizing the results , " david gamkrelidze of the new rights party said in televised remarks .
" the opposition is seriously considering the possibility of boycotting the new parliament , " he said , echoing other opposition leaders .
scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .
the opposition supports joining nato in principle but has accused saakashvili of arrogance and of ignoring the plight of the poor . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .
but whether we can or can not achieve that same level of traction - that is for people to find out and for the world to tell , but we certainly are going to try . i personally am going to try my hardest to get the awareness up and the toolkit available to people - at least to the layers that matter .
that is , the decision-making layers : the policy maker , the administrator , the businessman , and the consumer - you and me . what is your timetable for publicizing the results and then for continuing the work of the study ? to be totally frank with you , the results that we have today are largely for forest biomes , so clearly we need to expand our work there , and we need to make the evaluation work and the toolkit that we are preparing available in a realistic and reasonable format across the world .
it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .
we believe that everything we are doing has to be relevant to the end-users .
otherwise , it should not be done . we are very clear in our team that we do not re-invent the wheel , we do not do pure academia , we do not do only research for the sake of research , but we do research and compilation and assessments for the sake of putting it in the hands of people who make decisions : policymakers , administrators , the ceos of businesses , and perhaps most importantly , you and me as consumers . interview : irene quaile -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .
the opposition supports joining nato in principle but has accused saakashvili of arrogance and of ignoring the plight of the poor . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .
but whether we can or can not achieve that same level of traction - that is for people to find out and for the world to tell , but we certainly are going to try . i personally am going to try my hardest to get the awareness up and the toolkit available to people - at least to the layers that matter .
that is , the decision-making layers : the policy maker , the administrator , the businessman , and the consumer - you and me . what is your timetable for publicizing the results and then for continuing the work of the study ? to be totally frank with you , the results that we have today are largely for forest biomes , so clearly we need to expand our work there , and we need to make the evaluation work and the toolkit that we are preparing available in a realistic and reasonable format across the world .
it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .
we believe that everything we are doing has to be relevant to the end-users .
otherwise , it should not be done . we are very clear in our team that we do not re-invent the wheel , we do not do pure academia , we do not do only research for the sake of research , but we do research and compilation and assessments for the sake of putting it in the hands of people who make decisions : policymakers , administrators , the ceos of businesses , and perhaps most importantly , you and me as consumers . interview : irene quaile -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .

turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .

the treaty aims to make the 27-member bloc more efficient . the bundesrat approved the new eu treaty on friday , may 23 . the vote was its last legislative hurdle in the 27-nation bloc 's most populous country . the bundesrat represents the country 's 16 state governments .
all but one voted in favor . the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , last month overwhelmingly backed the treaty by 514 votes for to 58 against , with one abstention from berlin . by abstaining , mayor klaus wowereit effectively voted ' no ' but thereby averted a stand-off within the berlin government between his own social democrat party and its coalition partner , the left party . the left draws most of its support in the former communist east of the country , and sees the treaty as opposed to its social policies . wowereit was sharply critical of his coalition partner .
party leader oskar lafontaine had demonstrated that " the left is not capable or ready to be in government at federal level , " the mayor said ahead of the vote . the 53 members of the left made up the bulk of the opposition during the bundestag 's vote last month . some of them have signalled they might now mount a constitutional challenge to the treaty through the courts . a " new foundation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit staved off a crisis in his government chancellor angela merkel , who was one of the main drivers of the process leading up to the slimmed down treaty , described it as " good for europe " and a " win for germany " - and said it creates " nothing less than a new foundation for europe . " only president horst koehler 's signature is now required to complete ratification . the treaty was signed in the portuguese capital on dec .
13 .
it replaces the failed european constitution , which was abandoned after the french and dutch rejected it in referenda in 2005 . the 27 eu member states are being asked to ratify the treaty by the end of the year , ahead of elections to the european parliament in 2009 .
ireland is to hold a referendum on the treaty in june - the only country to do so . the treaty , a complex legal document comprising a string of amendments to previous eu deals , aims to streamline decision-making through increased use of majority votes and creates the offices of an eu president and foreign policy supremo with clout . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debate on the eu 's " return directive " comes at a sensitive time for europe , with some governments seeking to crack down on the seemingly unstoppable flow of africans and asians who continue to enter their territories illegally .
this week , the conservative italian government of silvio berlusconi launched a major anti-immigration push when it said it would join other european countries such as france in making illegal immigration a criminal offence punishable by jail .

observers say the election was fairer than previous polls but still flawed . the georgian election commission said friday , may 23 , that pro-western president mikhail saakashvili 's united national movement won the parliamentary polls this week with 59.5 percent of the vote - trailed by the united opposition council with 17.7 percent .
the party won 120 of 150 parliamentary seats assigned by constituency and a crushing majority of the other half of the seats , allocated proportionally according to the national vote , the electoral commission said .
rigged but the opposition said the poll had been rigged and threatened protests and a parliamentary boycott .
" these elections do n't reflect the people 's choice and the people 's will .
we are not recognizing the results , " david gamkrelidze of the new rights party said in televised remarks .
" the opposition is seriously considering the possibility of boycotting the new parliament , " he said , echoing other opposition leaders .
scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .
the opposition supports joining nato in principle but has accused saakashvili of arrogance and of ignoring the plight of the poor . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debate on the eu 's " return directive " comes at a sensitive time for europe , with some governments seeking to crack down on the seemingly unstoppable flow of africans and asians who continue to enter their territories illegally .
this week , the conservative italian government of silvio berlusconi launched a major anti-immigration push when it said it would join other european countries such as france in making illegal immigration a criminal offence punishable by jail .

observers say the election was fairer than previous polls but still flawed . the georgian election commission said friday , may 23 , that pro-western president mikhail saakashvili 's united national movement won the parliamentary polls this week with 59.5 percent of the vote - trailed by the united opposition council with 17.7 percent .
the party won 120 of 150 parliamentary seats assigned by constituency and a crushing majority of the other half of the seats , allocated proportionally according to the national vote , the electoral commission said .
rigged but the opposition said the poll had been rigged and threatened protests and a parliamentary boycott .
" these elections do n't reflect the people 's choice and the people 's will .
we are not recognizing the results , " david gamkrelidze of the new rights party said in televised remarks .
" the opposition is seriously considering the possibility of boycotting the new parliament , " he said , echoing other opposition leaders .
scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .
the opposition supports joining nato in principle but has accused saakashvili of arrogance and of ignoring the plight of the poor . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .
but whether we can or can not achieve that same level of traction - that is for people to find out and for the world to tell , but we certainly are going to try . i personally am going to try my hardest to get the awareness up and the toolkit available to people - at least to the layers that matter .
that is , the decision-making layers : the policy maker , the administrator , the businessman , and the consumer - you and me . what is your timetable for publicizing the results and then for continuing the work of the study ? to be totally frank with you , the results that we have today are largely for forest biomes , so clearly we need to expand our work there , and we need to make the evaluation work and the toolkit that we are preparing available in a realistic and reasonable format across the world .
it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .
we believe that everything we are doing has to be relevant to the end-users .
otherwise , it should not be done . we are very clear in our team that we do not re-invent the wheel , we do not do pure academia , we do not do only research for the sake of research , but we do research and compilation and assessments for the sake of putting it in the hands of people who make decisions : policymakers , administrators , the ceos of businesses , and perhaps most importantly , you and me as consumers . interview : irene quaile -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?
i hope , at least , as far as the quarter-final .
that for us would be a great achievement .

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .

yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?
i hope , at least , as far as the quarter-final .
that for us would be a great achievement .

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .

also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .

dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .
but whether we can or can not achieve that same level of traction - that is for people to find out and for the world to tell , but we certainly are going to try . i personally am going to try my hardest to get the awareness up and the toolkit available to people - at least to the layers that matter .
that is , the decision-making layers : the policy maker , the administrator , the businessman , and the consumer - you and me . what is your timetable for publicizing the results and then for continuing the work of the study ? to be totally frank with you , the results that we have today are largely for forest biomes , so clearly we need to expand our work there , and we need to make the evaluation work and the toolkit that we are preparing available in a realistic and reasonable format across the world .
it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .
we believe that everything we are doing has to be relevant to the end-users .
otherwise , it should not be done . we are very clear in our team that we do not re-invent the wheel , we do not do pure academia , we do not do only research for the sake of research , but we do research and compilation and assessments for the sake of putting it in the hands of people who make decisions : policymakers , administrators , the ceos of businesses , and perhaps most importantly , you and me as consumers . interview : irene quaile -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?
i hope , at least , as far as the quarter-final .
that for us would be a great achievement .

the treaty aims to make the 27-member bloc more efficient . the bundesrat approved the new eu treaty on friday , may 23 . the vote was its last legislative hurdle in the 27-nation bloc 's most populous country . the bundesrat represents the country 's 16 state governments .
all but one voted in favor . the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , last month overwhelmingly backed the treaty by 514 votes for to 58 against , with one abstention from berlin . by abstaining , mayor klaus wowereit effectively voted ' no ' but thereby averted a stand-off within the berlin government between his own social democrat party and its coalition partner , the left party . the left draws most of its support in the former communist east of the country , and sees the treaty as opposed to its social policies . wowereit was sharply critical of his coalition partner .
party leader oskar lafontaine had demonstrated that " the left is not capable or ready to be in government at federal level , " the mayor said ahead of the vote . the 53 members of the left made up the bulk of the opposition during the bundestag 's vote last month . some of them have signalled they might now mount a constitutional challenge to the treaty through the courts . a " new foundation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit staved off a crisis in his government chancellor angela merkel , who was one of the main drivers of the process leading up to the slimmed down treaty , described it as " good for europe " and a " win for germany " - and said it creates " nothing less than a new foundation for europe . " only president horst koehler 's signature is now required to complete ratification . the treaty was signed in the portuguese capital on dec .
13 .
it replaces the failed european constitution , which was abandoned after the french and dutch rejected it in referenda in 2005 . the 27 eu member states are being asked to ratify the treaty by the end of the year , ahead of elections to the european parliament in 2009 .
ireland is to hold a referendum on the treaty in june - the only country to do so . the treaty , a complex legal document comprising a string of amendments to previous eu deals , aims to streamline decision-making through increased use of majority votes and creates the offices of an eu president and foreign policy supremo with clout . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .
just 10 years ago , a major earthquake occurred in nearby adana . the power plant will endanger not just turkey , but the whole world , warned gurbuz . susanne guesten -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

observers say the election was fairer than previous polls but still flawed . the georgian election commission said friday , may 23 , that pro-western president mikhail saakashvili 's united national movement won the parliamentary polls this week with 59.5 percent of the vote - trailed by the united opposition council with 17.7 percent .
the party won 120 of 150 parliamentary seats assigned by constituency and a crushing majority of the other half of the seats , allocated proportionally according to the national vote , the electoral commission said .
rigged but the opposition said the poll had been rigged and threatened protests and a parliamentary boycott .
" these elections do n't reflect the people 's choice and the people 's will .
we are not recognizing the results , " david gamkrelidze of the new rights party said in televised remarks .
" the opposition is seriously considering the possibility of boycotting the new parliament , " he said , echoing other opposition leaders .
scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .
the opposition supports joining nato in principle but has accused saakashvili of arrogance and of ignoring the plight of the poor . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debate on the eu 's " return directive " comes at a sensitive time for europe , with some governments seeking to crack down on the seemingly unstoppable flow of africans and asians who continue to enter their territories illegally .
this week , the conservative italian government of silvio berlusconi launched a major anti-immigration push when it said it would join other european countries such as france in making illegal immigration a criminal offence punishable by jail .

the latest deal on the return directive was brokered by the slovenian presidency of the eu and also regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants , re-admission to their country of origin and access by non-governmental organizations to eu detention centers .
the draft agreed by eu ambassadors on thursday does not force governments to pay for an illegal immigrant 's legal aid , as some had wanted .

observers say the election was fairer than previous polls but still flawed . the georgian election commission said friday , may 23 , that pro-western president mikhail saakashvili 's united national movement won the parliamentary polls this week with 59.5 percent of the vote - trailed by the united opposition council with 17.7 percent .
the party won 120 of 150 parliamentary seats assigned by constituency and a crushing majority of the other half of the seats , allocated proportionally according to the national vote , the electoral commission said .
rigged but the opposition said the poll had been rigged and threatened protests and a parliamentary boycott .
" these elections do n't reflect the people 's choice and the people 's will .
we are not recognizing the results , " david gamkrelidze of the new rights party said in televised remarks .
" the opposition is seriously considering the possibility of boycotting the new parliament , " he said , echoing other opposition leaders .
scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .
the opposition supports joining nato in principle but has accused saakashvili of arrogance and of ignoring the plight of the poor . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?
i hope , at least , as far as the quarter-final .
that for us would be a great achievement .
what does austria want to achieve as the host ?
if we are as successful as the germans in 2006 , we can be very content . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.05.2008 turkey 's nuclear power plans draw outrage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a negative track record , turkey wants to begin producing nuclear energy plans to build several new nuclear power plants have come up against hefty protest in turkey , which is still suffering the effects of the 1986 chernobyl meltdown .
turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .
just 10 years ago , a major earthquake occurred in nearby adana . the power plant will endanger not just turkey , but the whole world , warned gurbuz . susanne guesten -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the treaty aims to make the 27-member bloc more efficient . the bundesrat approved the new eu treaty on friday , may 23 . the vote was its last legislative hurdle in the 27-nation bloc 's most populous country . the bundesrat represents the country 's 16 state governments .
all but one voted in favor . the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , last month overwhelmingly backed the treaty by 514 votes for to 58 against , with one abstention from berlin . by abstaining , mayor klaus wowereit effectively voted ' no ' but thereby averted a stand-off within the berlin government between his own social democrat party and its coalition partner , the left party . the left draws most of its support in the former communist east of the country , and sees the treaty as opposed to its social policies . wowereit was sharply critical of his coalition partner .
party leader oskar lafontaine had demonstrated that " the left is not capable or ready to be in government at federal level , " the mayor said ahead of the vote . the 53 members of the left made up the bulk of the opposition during the bundestag 's vote last month . some of them have signalled they might now mount a constitutional challenge to the treaty through the courts . a " new foundation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit staved off a crisis in his government chancellor angela merkel , who was one of the main drivers of the process leading up to the slimmed down treaty , described it as " good for europe " and a " win for germany " - and said it creates " nothing less than a new foundation for europe . " only president horst koehler 's signature is now required to complete ratification . the treaty was signed in the portuguese capital on dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.05.2008 turkey 's nuclear power plans draw outrage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a negative track record , turkey wants to begin producing nuclear energy plans to build several new nuclear power plants have come up against hefty protest in turkey , which is still suffering the effects of the 1986 chernobyl meltdown .
turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .
just 10 years ago , a major earthquake occurred in nearby adana . the power plant will endanger not just turkey , but the whole world , warned gurbuz . susanne guesten -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?
i hope , at least , as far as the quarter-final .
that for us would be a great achievement .
what does austria want to achieve as the host ?

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?
i hope , at least , as far as the quarter-final .
that for us would be a great achievement .
what does austria want to achieve as the host ?
if we are as successful as the germans in 2006 , we can be very content . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .

observers say the election was fairer than previous polls but still flawed . the georgian election commission said friday , may 23 , that pro-western president mikhail saakashvili 's united national movement won the parliamentary polls this week with 59.5 percent of the vote - trailed by the united opposition council with 17.7 percent .
the party won 120 of 150 parliamentary seats assigned by constituency and a crushing majority of the other half of the seats , allocated proportionally according to the national vote , the electoral commission said .
rigged but the opposition said the poll had been rigged and threatened protests and a parliamentary boycott .
" these elections do n't reflect the people 's choice and the people 's will .
we are not recognizing the results , " david gamkrelidze of the new rights party said in televised remarks .
" the opposition is seriously considering the possibility of boycotting the new parliament , " he said , echoing other opposition leaders .
scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .
the opposition supports joining nato in principle but has accused saakashvili of arrogance and of ignoring the plight of the poor . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany contributed most in overall terms to the rise with additional emissions of 9 million tons .
but the country actually stayed below the maximum level of 498 million tons with a total of 487 million tons emitted . the netherlands emitted 3.2 million additional tons , but 10 percent less than their maximum allowance of nearly 80 million tons .
britain -lrb- 5.4 million tons -rrb- and spain -lrb- 6.8 million tons -rrb- on the other hand went above the maximum level by 2.1 and 3.8 percent respectively . embarrassing numbers between them , the quartet accounted for over two-thirds of the entire rise in emissions seen across the eu .
their increase was partially offset by other countries decreasing their emissions . that revelation is likely to be a major embarrassment to the veteran member states , who in 2007 spearheaded an agreement to cut the bloc 's co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have every reason to be proud as far as their emissions are concerned it overturns the long-held assumption that it is the eu 's new member states , with their relatively fast-growing economies , who are likely to record the highest emissions growths . indeed , while new members estonia and the czech republic showed the highest emissions-growth rates in the eu , their fellow-newcomers cyprus , slovenia and hungary all recorded slower growth rates than eu veterans , including the netherlands , spain or greece . newcomers latvia , lithuania , poland and slovakia even managed to reduce their emissions in 2007 - despite economic growth rates which were among the fastest in the bloc . bargaining chip for brussels the results , which confirm preliminary reports from early april , are likely to strengthen the commission 's hand in negotiations to expand the trading scheme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavros dimas backs strict limits on emissions " studies show that emissions would most likely have been significantly higher without the eu trading scheme , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" however , the small rise last year further confirms the need for a strict emissions cap . " the emission trading scheme , or ets , was launched in 2005 as a way of making it more expensive to emit co2 , and thus to make it more cost-effective for factories to reduce their emissions . the price to emit a ton of co2 quickly rose to over 30 euros -lrb- $ 47.1 -rrb- , but collapsed when it was revealed in early 2006 that eu states had issued more permits than their factories had emitted co2 . in january , the commission proposed a series of amendments to the ets ' rules .
the most important proposals were to set a single , eu-wide cap on emissions permits rather than giving each member state an individual target , to make industry bid for permits at auction , and to include more types of industry in the ets . frustrated un official bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why should countries like south africa clean up their act if g8 countries do n't ?
the un 's top climate official on friday meanwhile also expressed his frustration over europe failing to take its place as a role model when it comes to fighting global warming . " we really need a push now from g8 countries to show leadership , " said yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , a day before environment ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nations were due to meet in kobe , japan . reaching a consensus on medium- and long-term goals for reducing greenhouse gases ahead of the g8 summit in july , also taking place in japan , would be " very difficult , " he predicted . de boer , in an unusual expression of frustration , was notably concerned that europe was softening its landmark commitments to cut greenhouse gases , thus sending the wrong signal to developing nations . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .
but whether we can or can not achieve that same level of traction - that is for people to find out and for the world to tell , but we certainly are going to try . i personally am going to try my hardest to get the awareness up and the toolkit available to people - at least to the layers that matter .
that is , the decision-making layers : the policy maker , the administrator , the businessman , and the consumer - you and me . what is your timetable for publicizing the results and then for continuing the work of the study ? to be totally frank with you , the results that we have today are largely for forest biomes , so clearly we need to expand our work there , and we need to make the evaluation work and the toolkit that we are preparing available in a realistic and reasonable format across the world .
it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .
we believe that everything we are doing has to be relevant to the end-users .
otherwise , it should not be done . we are very clear in our team that we do not re-invent the wheel , we do not do pure academia , we do not do only research for the sake of research , but we do research and compilation and assessments for the sake of putting it in the hands of people who make decisions : policymakers , administrators , the ceos of businesses , and perhaps most importantly , you and me as consumers . interview : irene quaile -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .

if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?

it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .

members of france 's germany-speaking minority said they were thrilled . according to the plan , which was submitted by a member of the conservative ump party of president nicolas sarkozy , article 1 of the french constitution would be amended to include the following phrase : " regional languages are part of the cultural heritage " of the nation .
" french is the language of the republic .

germany contributed most in overall terms to the rise with additional emissions of 9 million tons .
but the country actually stayed below the maximum level of 498 million tons with a total of 487 million tons emitted . the netherlands emitted 3.2 million additional tons , but 10 percent less than their maximum allowance of nearly 80 million tons .

their increase was partially offset by other countries decreasing their emissions . that revelation is likely to be a major embarrassment to the veteran member states , who in 2007 spearheaded an agreement to cut the bloc 's co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have every reason to be proud as far as their emissions are concerned it overturns the long-held assumption that it is the eu 's new member states , with their relatively fast-growing economies , who are likely to record the highest emissions growths . indeed , while new members estonia and the czech republic showed the highest emissions-growth rates in the eu , their fellow-newcomers cyprus , slovenia and hungary all recorded slower growth rates than eu veterans , including the netherlands , spain or greece . newcomers latvia , lithuania , poland and slovakia even managed to reduce their emissions in 2007 - despite economic growth rates which were among the fastest in the bloc . bargaining chip for brussels the results , which confirm preliminary reports from early april , are likely to strengthen the commission 's hand in negotiations to expand the trading scheme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavros dimas backs strict limits on emissions " studies show that emissions would most likely have been significantly higher without the eu trading scheme , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" however , the small rise last year further confirms the need for a strict emissions cap . " the emission trading scheme , or ets , was launched in 2005 as a way of making it more expensive to emit co2 , and thus to make it more cost-effective for factories to reduce their emissions . the price to emit a ton of co2 quickly rose to over 30 euros -lrb- $ 47.1 -rrb- , but collapsed when it was revealed in early 2006 that eu states had issued more permits than their factories had emitted co2 . in january , the commission proposed a series of amendments to the ets ' rules .
the most important proposals were to set a single , eu-wide cap on emissions permits rather than giving each member state an individual target , to make industry bid for permits at auction , and to include more types of industry in the ets . frustrated un official bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why should countries like south africa clean up their act if g8 countries do n't ?

germany contributed most in overall terms to the rise with additional emissions of 9 million tons .
but the country actually stayed below the maximum level of 498 million tons with a total of 487 million tons emitted . the netherlands emitted 3.2 million additional tons , but 10 percent less than their maximum allowance of nearly 80 million tons .
britain -lrb- 5.4 million tons -rrb- and spain -lrb- 6.8 million tons -rrb- on the other hand went above the maximum level by 2.1 and 3.8 percent respectively . embarrassing numbers between them , the quartet accounted for over two-thirds of the entire rise in emissions seen across the eu .
their increase was partially offset by other countries decreasing their emissions . that revelation is likely to be a major embarrassment to the veteran member states , who in 2007 spearheaded an agreement to cut the bloc 's co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have every reason to be proud as far as their emissions are concerned it overturns the long-held assumption that it is the eu 's new member states , with their relatively fast-growing economies , who are likely to record the highest emissions growths . indeed , while new members estonia and the czech republic showed the highest emissions-growth rates in the eu , their fellow-newcomers cyprus , slovenia and hungary all recorded slower growth rates than eu veterans , including the netherlands , spain or greece . newcomers latvia , lithuania , poland and slovakia even managed to reduce their emissions in 2007 - despite economic growth rates which were among the fastest in the bloc . bargaining chip for brussels the results , which confirm preliminary reports from early april , are likely to strengthen the commission 's hand in negotiations to expand the trading scheme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavros dimas backs strict limits on emissions " studies show that emissions would most likely have been significantly higher without the eu trading scheme , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" however , the small rise last year further confirms the need for a strict emissions cap . " the emission trading scheme , or ets , was launched in 2005 as a way of making it more expensive to emit co2 , and thus to make it more cost-effective for factories to reduce their emissions . the price to emit a ton of co2 quickly rose to over 30 euros -lrb- $ 47.1 -rrb- , but collapsed when it was revealed in early 2006 that eu states had issued more permits than their factories had emitted co2 . in january , the commission proposed a series of amendments to the ets ' rules .
the most important proposals were to set a single , eu-wide cap on emissions permits rather than giving each member state an individual target , to make industry bid for permits at auction , and to include more types of industry in the ets . frustrated un official bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why should countries like south africa clean up their act if g8 countries do n't ?
the un 's top climate official on friday meanwhile also expressed his frustration over europe failing to take its place as a role model when it comes to fighting global warming . " we really need a push now from g8 countries to show leadership , " said yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , a day before environment ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nations were due to meet in kobe , japan . reaching a consensus on medium- and long-term goals for reducing greenhouse gases ahead of the g8 summit in july , also taking place in japan , would be " very difficult , " he predicted . de boer , in an unusual expression of frustration , was notably concerned that europe was softening its landmark commitments to cut greenhouse gases , thus sending the wrong signal to developing nations . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany contributed most in overall terms to the rise with additional emissions of 9 million tons .
but the country actually stayed below the maximum level of 498 million tons with a total of 487 million tons emitted . the netherlands emitted 3.2 million additional tons , but 10 percent less than their maximum allowance of nearly 80 million tons .
britain -lrb- 5.4 million tons -rrb- and spain -lrb- 6.8 million tons -rrb- on the other hand went above the maximum level by 2.1 and 3.8 percent respectively . embarrassing numbers between them , the quartet accounted for over two-thirds of the entire rise in emissions seen across the eu .
their increase was partially offset by other countries decreasing their emissions . that revelation is likely to be a major embarrassment to the veteran member states , who in 2007 spearheaded an agreement to cut the bloc 's co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have every reason to be proud as far as their emissions are concerned it overturns the long-held assumption that it is the eu 's new member states , with their relatively fast-growing economies , who are likely to record the highest emissions growths . indeed , while new members estonia and the czech republic showed the highest emissions-growth rates in the eu , their fellow-newcomers cyprus , slovenia and hungary all recorded slower growth rates than eu veterans , including the netherlands , spain or greece . newcomers latvia , lithuania , poland and slovakia even managed to reduce their emissions in 2007 - despite economic growth rates which were among the fastest in the bloc . bargaining chip for brussels the results , which confirm preliminary reports from early april , are likely to strengthen the commission 's hand in negotiations to expand the trading scheme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavros dimas backs strict limits on emissions " studies show that emissions would most likely have been significantly higher without the eu trading scheme , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" however , the small rise last year further confirms the need for a strict emissions cap . " the emission trading scheme , or ets , was launched in 2005 as a way of making it more expensive to emit co2 , and thus to make it more cost-effective for factories to reduce their emissions . the price to emit a ton of co2 quickly rose to over 30 euros -lrb- $ 47.1 -rrb- , but collapsed when it was revealed in early 2006 that eu states had issued more permits than their factories had emitted co2 . in january , the commission proposed a series of amendments to the ets ' rules .
the most important proposals were to set a single , eu-wide cap on emissions permits rather than giving each member state an individual target , to make industry bid for permits at auction , and to include more types of industry in the ets . frustrated un official bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why should countries like south africa clean up their act if g8 countries do n't ?
the un 's top climate official on friday meanwhile also expressed his frustration over europe failing to take its place as a role model when it comes to fighting global warming . " we really need a push now from g8 countries to show leadership , " said yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , a day before environment ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nations were due to meet in kobe , japan . reaching a consensus on medium- and long-term goals for reducing greenhouse gases ahead of the g8 summit in july , also taking place in japan , would be " very difficult , " he predicted . de boer , in an unusual expression of frustration , was notably concerned that europe was softening its landmark commitments to cut greenhouse gases , thus sending the wrong signal to developing nations . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?
i hope , at least , as far as the quarter-final .
that for us would be a great achievement .

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?
i hope , at least , as far as the quarter-final .
that for us would be a great achievement .
what does austria want to achieve as the host ?
if we are as successful as the germans in 2006 , we can be very content . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debate on the eu 's " return directive " comes at a sensitive time for europe , with some governments seeking to crack down on the seemingly unstoppable flow of africans and asians who continue to enter their territories illegally .
this week , the conservative italian government of silvio berlusconi launched a major anti-immigration push when it said it would join other european countries such as france in making illegal immigration a criminal offence punishable by jail .
the move has infuriated another mediterranean country , spain , which fears that it will induce would-be immigrants coming from africa to try and reach its territory instead .

earlier this month , over 10 countries voiced opposition to a draft law .
the latest deal on the return directive was brokered by the slovenian presidency of the eu and also regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants , re-admission to their country of origin and access by non-governmental organizations to eu detention centers .
the draft agreed by eu ambassadors on thursday does not force governments to pay for an illegal immigrant 's legal aid , as some had wanted .
instead , it includes a non-binding invitation to governments to set aside the necessary funds needed to assist destitute migrants .
opposition the package will next month be voted on by the european parliament .
but its passage is threatened by reservations voiced by the second-largest political bloc in the parliament , the socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detention is seen by many as inhumane they say the six-month detention period is too long .
further opposition has come from the non-governmental sector .
according to the european council on refugees and exiles , detention should only ever be a last resort .
" we consider that systematic detention of people who have committed no crime , including families and vulnerable persons , is inhumane and unwarranted , " the ngo has said .

the debate on the eu 's " return directive " comes at a sensitive time for europe , with some governments seeking to crack down on the seemingly unstoppable flow of africans and asians who continue to enter their territories illegally .
this week , the conservative italian government of silvio berlusconi launched a major anti-immigration push when it said it would join other european countries such as france in making illegal immigration a criminal offence punishable by jail .
the move has infuriated another mediterranean country , spain , which fears that it will induce would-be immigrants coming from africa to try and reach its territory instead .

the latest deal on the return directive was brokered by the slovenian presidency of the eu and also regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants , re-admission to their country of origin and access by non-governmental organizations to eu detention centers .
the draft agreed by eu ambassadors on thursday does not force governments to pay for an illegal immigrant 's legal aid , as some had wanted .

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?
i hope , at least , as far as the quarter-final .
that for us would be a great achievement .
what does austria want to achieve as the host ?
if we are as successful as the germans in 2006 , we can be very content . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .

turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .

observers say the election was fairer than previous polls but still flawed . the georgian election commission said friday , may 23 , that pro-western president mikhail saakashvili 's united national movement won the parliamentary polls this week with 59.5 percent of the vote - trailed by the united opposition council with 17.7 percent .
the party won 120 of 150 parliamentary seats assigned by constituency and a crushing majority of the other half of the seats , allocated proportionally according to the national vote , the electoral commission said .
rigged but the opposition said the poll had been rigged and threatened protests and a parliamentary boycott .
" these elections do n't reflect the people 's choice and the people 's will .
we are not recognizing the results , " david gamkrelidze of the new rights party said in televised remarks .
" the opposition is seriously considering the possibility of boycotting the new parliament , " he said , echoing other opposition leaders .
scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .
the opposition supports joining nato in principle but has accused saakashvili of arrogance and of ignoring the plight of the poor . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

observers say the election was fairer than previous polls but still flawed . the georgian election commission said friday , may 23 , that pro-western president mikhail saakashvili 's united national movement won the parliamentary polls this week with 59.5 percent of the vote - trailed by the united opposition council with 17.7 percent .
the party won 120 of 150 parliamentary seats assigned by constituency and a crushing majority of the other half of the seats , allocated proportionally according to the national vote , the electoral commission said .
rigged but the opposition said the poll had been rigged and threatened protests and a parliamentary boycott .
" these elections do n't reflect the people 's choice and the people 's will .
we are not recognizing the results , " david gamkrelidze of the new rights party said in televised remarks .
" the opposition is seriously considering the possibility of boycotting the new parliament , " he said , echoing other opposition leaders .
scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .
the opposition supports joining nato in principle but has accused saakashvili of arrogance and of ignoring the plight of the poor . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .
but whether we can or can not achieve that same level of traction - that is for people to find out and for the world to tell , but we certainly are going to try . i personally am going to try my hardest to get the awareness up and the toolkit available to people - at least to the layers that matter .
that is , the decision-making layers : the policy maker , the administrator , the businessman , and the consumer - you and me . what is your timetable for publicizing the results and then for continuing the work of the study ? to be totally frank with you , the results that we have today are largely for forest biomes , so clearly we need to expand our work there , and we need to make the evaluation work and the toolkit that we are preparing available in a realistic and reasonable format across the world .
it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .
we believe that everything we are doing has to be relevant to the end-users .
otherwise , it should not be done . we are very clear in our team that we do not re-invent the wheel , we do not do pure academia , we do not do only research for the sake of research , but we do research and compilation and assessments for the sake of putting it in the hands of people who make decisions : policymakers , administrators , the ceos of businesses , and perhaps most importantly , you and me as consumers . interview : irene quaile -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .
but whether we can or can not achieve that same level of traction - that is for people to find out and for the world to tell , but we certainly are going to try . i personally am going to try my hardest to get the awareness up and the toolkit available to people - at least to the layers that matter .
that is , the decision-making layers : the policy maker , the administrator , the businessman , and the consumer - you and me . what is your timetable for publicizing the results and then for continuing the work of the study ? to be totally frank with you , the results that we have today are largely for forest biomes , so clearly we need to expand our work there , and we need to make the evaluation work and the toolkit that we are preparing available in a realistic and reasonable format across the world .
it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .
we believe that everything we are doing has to be relevant to the end-users .
otherwise , it should not be done . we are very clear in our team that we do not re-invent the wheel , we do not do pure academia , we do not do only research for the sake of research , but we do research and compilation and assessments for the sake of putting it in the hands of people who make decisions : policymakers , administrators , the ceos of businesses , and perhaps most importantly , you and me as consumers . interview : irene quaile -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .
but whether we can or can not achieve that same level of traction - that is for people to find out and for the world to tell , but we certainly are going to try . i personally am going to try my hardest to get the awareness up and the toolkit available to people - at least to the layers that matter .
that is , the decision-making layers : the policy maker , the administrator , the businessman , and the consumer - you and me . what is your timetable for publicizing the results and then for continuing the work of the study ? to be totally frank with you , the results that we have today are largely for forest biomes , so clearly we need to expand our work there , and we need to make the evaluation work and the toolkit that we are preparing available in a realistic and reasonable format across the world .
it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .
we believe that everything we are doing has to be relevant to the end-users .
otherwise , it should not be done . we are very clear in our team that we do not re-invent the wheel , we do not do pure academia , we do not do only research for the sake of research , but we do research and compilation and assessments for the sake of putting it in the hands of people who make decisions : policymakers , administrators , the ceos of businesses , and perhaps most importantly , you and me as consumers . interview : irene quaile -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .
but whether we can or can not achieve that same level of traction - that is for people to find out and for the world to tell , but we certainly are going to try . i personally am going to try my hardest to get the awareness up and the toolkit available to people - at least to the layers that matter .
that is , the decision-making layers : the policy maker , the administrator , the businessman , and the consumer - you and me . what is your timetable for publicizing the results and then for continuing the work of the study ? to be totally frank with you , the results that we have today are largely for forest biomes , so clearly we need to expand our work there , and we need to make the evaluation work and the toolkit that we are preparing available in a realistic and reasonable format across the world .
it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .
we believe that everything we are doing has to be relevant to the end-users .
otherwise , it should not be done . we are very clear in our team that we do not re-invent the wheel , we do not do pure academia , we do not do only research for the sake of research , but we do research and compilation and assessments for the sake of putting it in the hands of people who make decisions : policymakers , administrators , the ceos of businesses , and perhaps most importantly , you and me as consumers . interview : irene quaile -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.05.2008 turkey 's nuclear power plans draw outrage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a negative track record , turkey wants to begin producing nuclear energy plans to build several new nuclear power plants have come up against hefty protest in turkey , which is still suffering the effects of the 1986 chernobyl meltdown .
turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .
just 10 years ago , a major earthquake occurred in nearby adana . the power plant will endanger not just turkey , but the whole world , warned gurbuz . susanne guesten -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the treaty aims to make the 27-member bloc more efficient . the bundesrat approved the new eu treaty on friday , may 23 . the vote was its last legislative hurdle in the 27-nation bloc 's most populous country . the bundesrat represents the country 's 16 state governments .
all but one voted in favor . the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , last month overwhelmingly backed the treaty by 514 votes for to 58 against , with one abstention from berlin . by abstaining , mayor klaus wowereit effectively voted ' no ' but thereby averted a stand-off within the berlin government between his own social democrat party and its coalition partner , the left party . the left draws most of its support in the former communist east of the country , and sees the treaty as opposed to its social policies . wowereit was sharply critical of his coalition partner .
party leader oskar lafontaine had demonstrated that " the left is not capable or ready to be in government at federal level , " the mayor said ahead of the vote . the 53 members of the left made up the bulk of the opposition during the bundestag 's vote last month . some of them have signalled they might now mount a constitutional challenge to the treaty through the courts . a " new foundation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit staved off a crisis in his government chancellor angela merkel , who was one of the main drivers of the process leading up to the slimmed down treaty , described it as " good for europe " and a " win for germany " - and said it creates " nothing less than a new foundation for europe . " only president horst koehler 's signature is now required to complete ratification . the treaty was signed in the portuguese capital on dec .
13 .
it replaces the failed european constitution , which was abandoned after the french and dutch rejected it in referenda in 2005 . the 27 eu member states are being asked to ratify the treaty by the end of the year , ahead of elections to the european parliament in 2009 .
ireland is to hold a referendum on the treaty in june - the only country to do so . the treaty , a complex legal document comprising a string of amendments to previous eu deals , aims to streamline decision-making through increased use of majority votes and creates the offices of an eu president and foreign policy supremo with clout . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .

observers say the election was fairer than previous polls but still flawed . the georgian election commission said friday , may 23 , that pro-western president mikhail saakashvili 's united national movement won the parliamentary polls this week with 59.5 percent of the vote - trailed by the united opposition council with 17.7 percent .
the party won 120 of 150 parliamentary seats assigned by constituency and a crushing majority of the other half of the seats , allocated proportionally according to the national vote , the electoral commission said .
rigged but the opposition said the poll had been rigged and threatened protests and a parliamentary boycott .
" these elections do n't reflect the people 's choice and the people 's will .
we are not recognizing the results , " david gamkrelidze of the new rights party said in televised remarks .
" the opposition is seriously considering the possibility of boycotting the new parliament , " he said , echoing other opposition leaders .
scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .
the opposition supports joining nato in principle but has accused saakashvili of arrogance and of ignoring the plight of the poor . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .
just 10 years ago , a major earthquake occurred in nearby adana . the power plant will endanger not just turkey , but the whole world , warned gurbuz . susanne guesten -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany contributed most in overall terms to the rise with additional emissions of 9 million tons .
but the country actually stayed below the maximum level of 498 million tons with a total of 487 million tons emitted . the netherlands emitted 3.2 million additional tons , but 10 percent less than their maximum allowance of nearly 80 million tons .
britain -lrb- 5.4 million tons -rrb- and spain -lrb- 6.8 million tons -rrb- on the other hand went above the maximum level by 2.1 and 3.8 percent respectively . embarrassing numbers between them , the quartet accounted for over two-thirds of the entire rise in emissions seen across the eu .
their increase was partially offset by other countries decreasing their emissions . that revelation is likely to be a major embarrassment to the veteran member states , who in 2007 spearheaded an agreement to cut the bloc 's co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have every reason to be proud as far as their emissions are concerned it overturns the long-held assumption that it is the eu 's new member states , with their relatively fast-growing economies , who are likely to record the highest emissions growths . indeed , while new members estonia and the czech republic showed the highest emissions-growth rates in the eu , their fellow-newcomers cyprus , slovenia and hungary all recorded slower growth rates than eu veterans , including the netherlands , spain or greece . newcomers latvia , lithuania , poland and slovakia even managed to reduce their emissions in 2007 - despite economic growth rates which were among the fastest in the bloc . bargaining chip for brussels the results , which confirm preliminary reports from early april , are likely to strengthen the commission 's hand in negotiations to expand the trading scheme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavros dimas backs strict limits on emissions " studies show that emissions would most likely have been significantly higher without the eu trading scheme , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .

" the emission trading scheme , or ets , was launched in 2005 as a way of making it more expensive to emit co2 , and thus to make it more cost-effective for factories to reduce their emissions . the price to emit a ton of co2 quickly rose to over 30 euros -lrb- $ 47.1 -rrb- , but collapsed when it was revealed in early 2006 that eu states had issued more permits than their factories had emitted co2 . in january , the commission proposed a series of amendments to the ets ' rules .
the most important proposals were to set a single , eu-wide cap on emissions permits rather than giving each member state an individual target , to make industry bid for permits at auction , and to include more types of industry in the ets . frustrated un official bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why should countries like south africa clean up their act if g8 countries do n't ?

but the country actually stayed below the maximum level of 498 million tons with a total of 487 million tons emitted . the netherlands emitted 3.2 million additional tons , but 10 percent less than their maximum allowance of nearly 80 million tons .
britain -lrb- 5.4 million tons -rrb- and spain -lrb- 6.8 million tons -rrb- on the other hand went above the maximum level by 2.1 and 3.8 percent respectively . embarrassing numbers between them , the quartet accounted for over two-thirds of the entire rise in emissions seen across the eu .
their increase was partially offset by other countries decreasing their emissions . that revelation is likely to be a major embarrassment to the veteran member states , who in 2007 spearheaded an agreement to cut the bloc 's co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have every reason to be proud as far as their emissions are concerned it overturns the long-held assumption that it is the eu 's new member states , with their relatively fast-growing economies , who are likely to record the highest emissions growths . indeed , while new members estonia and the czech republic showed the highest emissions-growth rates in the eu , their fellow-newcomers cyprus , slovenia and hungary all recorded slower growth rates than eu veterans , including the netherlands , spain or greece . newcomers latvia , lithuania , poland and slovakia even managed to reduce their emissions in 2007 - despite economic growth rates which were among the fastest in the bloc . bargaining chip for brussels the results , which confirm preliminary reports from early april , are likely to strengthen the commission 's hand in negotiations to expand the trading scheme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavros dimas backs strict limits on emissions " studies show that emissions would most likely have been significantly higher without the eu trading scheme , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .

" the emission trading scheme , or ets , was launched in 2005 as a way of making it more expensive to emit co2 , and thus to make it more cost-effective for factories to reduce their emissions . the price to emit a ton of co2 quickly rose to over 30 euros -lrb- $ 47.1 -rrb- , but collapsed when it was revealed in early 2006 that eu states had issued more permits than their factories had emitted co2 . in january , the commission proposed a series of amendments to the ets ' rules .
the most important proposals were to set a single , eu-wide cap on emissions permits rather than giving each member state an individual target , to make industry bid for permits at auction , and to include more types of industry in the ets . frustrated un official bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why should countries like south africa clean up their act if g8 countries do n't ?

observers say the election was fairer than previous polls but still flawed . the georgian election commission said friday , may 23 , that pro-western president mikhail saakashvili 's united national movement won the parliamentary polls this week with 59.5 percent of the vote - trailed by the united opposition council with 17.7 percent .
the party won 120 of 150 parliamentary seats assigned by constituency and a crushing majority of the other half of the seats , allocated proportionally according to the national vote , the electoral commission said .
rigged but the opposition said the poll had been rigged and threatened protests and a parliamentary boycott .
" these elections do n't reflect the people 's choice and the people 's will .
we are not recognizing the results , " david gamkrelidze of the new rights party said in televised remarks .
" the opposition is seriously considering the possibility of boycotting the new parliament , " he said , echoing other opposition leaders .
scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .
the opposition supports joining nato in principle but has accused saakashvili of arrogance and of ignoring the plight of the poor . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

observers say the election was fairer than previous polls but still flawed . the georgian election commission said friday , may 23 , that pro-western president mikhail saakashvili 's united national movement won the parliamentary polls this week with 59.5 percent of the vote - trailed by the united opposition council with 17.7 percent .
the party won 120 of 150 parliamentary seats assigned by constituency and a crushing majority of the other half of the seats , allocated proportionally according to the national vote , the electoral commission said .
rigged but the opposition said the poll had been rigged and threatened protests and a parliamentary boycott .
" these elections do n't reflect the people 's choice and the people 's will .
we are not recognizing the results , " david gamkrelidze of the new rights party said in televised remarks .
" the opposition is seriously considering the possibility of boycotting the new parliament , " he said , echoing other opposition leaders .
scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .

germany contributed most in overall terms to the rise with additional emissions of 9 million tons .
but the country actually stayed below the maximum level of 498 million tons with a total of 487 million tons emitted . the netherlands emitted 3.2 million additional tons , but 10 percent less than their maximum allowance of nearly 80 million tons .
britain -lrb- 5.4 million tons -rrb- and spain -lrb- 6.8 million tons -rrb- on the other hand went above the maximum level by 2.1 and 3.8 percent respectively . embarrassing numbers between them , the quartet accounted for over two-thirds of the entire rise in emissions seen across the eu .
their increase was partially offset by other countries decreasing their emissions . that revelation is likely to be a major embarrassment to the veteran member states , who in 2007 spearheaded an agreement to cut the bloc 's co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have every reason to be proud as far as their emissions are concerned it overturns the long-held assumption that it is the eu 's new member states , with their relatively fast-growing economies , who are likely to record the highest emissions growths . indeed , while new members estonia and the czech republic showed the highest emissions-growth rates in the eu , their fellow-newcomers cyprus , slovenia and hungary all recorded slower growth rates than eu veterans , including the netherlands , spain or greece . newcomers latvia , lithuania , poland and slovakia even managed to reduce their emissions in 2007 - despite economic growth rates which were among the fastest in the bloc . bargaining chip for brussels the results , which confirm preliminary reports from early april , are likely to strengthen the commission 's hand in negotiations to expand the trading scheme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavros dimas backs strict limits on emissions " studies show that emissions would most likely have been significantly higher without the eu trading scheme , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" however , the small rise last year further confirms the need for a strict emissions cap . " the emission trading scheme , or ets , was launched in 2005 as a way of making it more expensive to emit co2 , and thus to make it more cost-effective for factories to reduce their emissions . the price to emit a ton of co2 quickly rose to over 30 euros -lrb- $ 47.1 -rrb- , but collapsed when it was revealed in early 2006 that eu states had issued more permits than their factories had emitted co2 . in january , the commission proposed a series of amendments to the ets ' rules .
the most important proposals were to set a single , eu-wide cap on emissions permits rather than giving each member state an individual target , to make industry bid for permits at auction , and to include more types of industry in the ets . frustrated un official bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why should countries like south africa clean up their act if g8 countries do n't ?
the un 's top climate official on friday meanwhile also expressed his frustration over europe failing to take its place as a role model when it comes to fighting global warming . " we really need a push now from g8 countries to show leadership , " said yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , a day before environment ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nations were due to meet in kobe , japan . reaching a consensus on medium- and long-term goals for reducing greenhouse gases ahead of the g8 summit in july , also taking place in japan , would be " very difficult , " he predicted . de boer , in an unusual expression of frustration , was notably concerned that europe was softening its landmark commitments to cut greenhouse gases , thus sending the wrong signal to developing nations . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .

the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .

members of france 's germany-speaking minority said they were thrilled . according to the plan , which was submitted by a member of the conservative ump party of president nicolas sarkozy , article 1 of the french constitution would be amended to include the following phrase : " regional languages are part of the cultural heritage " of the nation .
" french is the language of the republic . " representatives of france 's german-speaking region of alsace described the proposal as a " victory " for all those , who have fought for more linguistic diversity in france . follow-ups needed " this is a first , very important step , " said francois schaffner , the president of alsace 's culture and bilingualism association , according to afp news service .
schaffner added that much - including legislation - still needs to happen in order for regional languages to receive more recognition in the public sphere , including french media and french classrooms . according to the french national assembly , france has about 75 regional languages .
apart from alsatian , these include basque , breton , catalan , corsican , occitan and flemish . the constitutional amendment is expected to be passed in july . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debate on the eu 's " return directive " comes at a sensitive time for europe , with some governments seeking to crack down on the seemingly unstoppable flow of africans and asians who continue to enter their territories illegally .
this week , the conservative italian government of silvio berlusconi launched a major anti-immigration push when it said it would join other european countries such as france in making illegal immigration a criminal offence punishable by jail .
the move has infuriated another mediterranean country , spain , which fears that it will induce would-be immigrants coming from africa to try and reach its territory instead .
non-binding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi plans to get tough on immigrants member states have been wrangling over the maximum period immigrants can be kept in detention for almost three years .
earlier this month , over 10 countries voiced opposition to a draft law .
the latest deal on the return directive was brokered by the slovenian presidency of the eu and also regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants , re-admission to their country of origin and access by non-governmental organizations to eu detention centers .
the draft agreed by eu ambassadors on thursday does not force governments to pay for an illegal immigrant 's legal aid , as some had wanted .
instead , it includes a non-binding invitation to governments to set aside the necessary funds needed to assist destitute migrants .
opposition the package will next month be voted on by the european parliament .
but its passage is threatened by reservations voiced by the second-largest political bloc in the parliament , the socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detention is seen by many as inhumane they say the six-month detention period is too long .
further opposition has come from the non-governmental sector .
according to the european council on refugees and exiles , detention should only ever be a last resort .
" we consider that systematic detention of people who have committed no crime , including families and vulnerable persons , is inhumane and unwarranted , " the ngo has said .
this is the first time that the european parliament has been given a decisive voice on immigration , an issue normally reserved to member states . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?

dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .

dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .
but whether we can or can not achieve that same level of traction - that is for people to find out and for the world to tell , but we certainly are going to try . i personally am going to try my hardest to get the awareness up and the toolkit available to people - at least to the layers that matter .
that is , the decision-making layers : the policy maker , the administrator , the businessman , and the consumer - you and me . what is your timetable for publicizing the results and then for continuing the work of the study ? to be totally frank with you , the results that we have today are largely for forest biomes , so clearly we need to expand our work there , and we need to make the evaluation work and the toolkit that we are preparing available in a realistic and reasonable format across the world .
it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .
we believe that everything we are doing has to be relevant to the end-users .
otherwise , it should not be done . we are very clear in our team that we do not re-invent the wheel , we do not do pure academia , we do not do only research for the sake of research , but we do research and compilation and assessments for the sake of putting it in the hands of people who make decisions : policymakers , administrators , the ceos of businesses , and perhaps most importantly , you and me as consumers . interview : irene quaile -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debate on the eu 's " return directive " comes at a sensitive time for europe , with some governments seeking to crack down on the seemingly unstoppable flow of africans and asians who continue to enter their territories illegally .
this week , the conservative italian government of silvio berlusconi launched a major anti-immigration push when it said it would join other european countries such as france in making illegal immigration a criminal offence punishable by jail .
the move has infuriated another mediterranean country , spain , which fears that it will induce would-be immigrants coming from africa to try and reach its territory instead .
non-binding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi plans to get tough on immigrants member states have been wrangling over the maximum period immigrants can be kept in detention for almost three years .
earlier this month , over 10 countries voiced opposition to a draft law .
the latest deal on the return directive was brokered by the slovenian presidency of the eu and also regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants , re-admission to their country of origin and access by non-governmental organizations to eu detention centers .
the draft agreed by eu ambassadors on thursday does not force governments to pay for an illegal immigrant 's legal aid , as some had wanted .
instead , it includes a non-binding invitation to governments to set aside the necessary funds needed to assist destitute migrants .
opposition the package will next month be voted on by the european parliament .
but its passage is threatened by reservations voiced by the second-largest political bloc in the parliament , the socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detention is seen by many as inhumane they say the six-month detention period is too long .
further opposition has come from the non-governmental sector .
according to the european council on refugees and exiles , detention should only ever be a last resort .
" we consider that systematic detention of people who have committed no crime , including families and vulnerable persons , is inhumane and unwarranted , " the ngo has said .
this is the first time that the european parliament has been given a decisive voice on immigration , an issue normally reserved to member states . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

observers say the election was fairer than previous polls but still flawed . the georgian election commission said friday , may 23 , that pro-western president mikhail saakashvili 's united national movement won the parliamentary polls this week with 59.5 percent of the vote - trailed by the united opposition council with 17.7 percent .
the party won 120 of 150 parliamentary seats assigned by constituency and a crushing majority of the other half of the seats , allocated proportionally according to the national vote , the electoral commission said .
rigged but the opposition said the poll had been rigged and threatened protests and a parliamentary boycott .
" these elections do n't reflect the people 's choice and the people 's will .
we are not recognizing the results , " david gamkrelidze of the new rights party said in televised remarks .
" the opposition is seriously considering the possibility of boycotting the new parliament , " he said , echoing other opposition leaders .
scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .
the opposition supports joining nato in principle but has accused saakashvili of arrogance and of ignoring the plight of the poor . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .
just 10 years ago , a major earthquake occurred in nearby adana . the power plant will endanger not just turkey , but the whole world , warned gurbuz . susanne guesten -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debate on the eu 's " return directive " comes at a sensitive time for europe , with some governments seeking to crack down on the seemingly unstoppable flow of africans and asians who continue to enter their territories illegally .

observers say the election was fairer than previous polls but still flawed . the georgian election commission said friday , may 23 , that pro-western president mikhail saakashvili 's united national movement won the parliamentary polls this week with 59.5 percent of the vote - trailed by the united opposition council with 17.7 percent .
the party won 120 of 150 parliamentary seats assigned by constituency and a crushing majority of the other half of the seats , allocated proportionally according to the national vote , the electoral commission said .
rigged but the opposition said the poll had been rigged and threatened protests and a parliamentary boycott .
" these elections do n't reflect the people 's choice and the people 's will .
we are not recognizing the results , " david gamkrelidze of the new rights party said in televised remarks .
" the opposition is seriously considering the possibility of boycotting the new parliament , " he said , echoing other opposition leaders .
scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .
the opposition supports joining nato in principle but has accused saakashvili of arrogance and of ignoring the plight of the poor . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : preserving biodiversity biodiversity conference ends with mixed results progress at mid-way point for un biodiversity conference merkel pledges funds at un biodiversity talks merkel warns of extinction threat to life on earth environment -pipe- 23.05.2008 biodiversity loss can dent world economy , study warns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loss of forest cover can affect the world economy a new study warns that destroying the diversity of animal and plant life can have serious repercussions for the world economy , with the poor bearing the brunt of the cost .
dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .

germany contributed most in overall terms to the rise with additional emissions of 9 million tons .
but the country actually stayed below the maximum level of 498 million tons with a total of 487 million tons emitted . the netherlands emitted 3.2 million additional tons , but 10 percent less than their maximum allowance of nearly 80 million tons .
britain -lrb- 5.4 million tons -rrb- and spain -lrb- 6.8 million tons -rrb- on the other hand went above the maximum level by 2.1 and 3.8 percent respectively . embarrassing numbers between them , the quartet accounted for over two-thirds of the entire rise in emissions seen across the eu .
their increase was partially offset by other countries decreasing their emissions . that revelation is likely to be a major embarrassment to the veteran member states , who in 2007 spearheaded an agreement to cut the bloc 's co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have every reason to be proud as far as their emissions are concerned it overturns the long-held assumption that it is the eu 's new member states , with their relatively fast-growing economies , who are likely to record the highest emissions growths . indeed , while new members estonia and the czech republic showed the highest emissions-growth rates in the eu , their fellow-newcomers cyprus , slovenia and hungary all recorded slower growth rates than eu veterans , including the netherlands , spain or greece . newcomers latvia , lithuania , poland and slovakia even managed to reduce their emissions in 2007 - despite economic growth rates which were among the fastest in the bloc . bargaining chip for brussels the results , which confirm preliminary reports from early april , are likely to strengthen the commission 's hand in negotiations to expand the trading scheme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavros dimas backs strict limits on emissions " studies show that emissions would most likely have been significantly higher without the eu trading scheme , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" however , the small rise last year further confirms the need for a strict emissions cap . " the emission trading scheme , or ets , was launched in 2005 as a way of making it more expensive to emit co2 , and thus to make it more cost-effective for factories to reduce their emissions . the price to emit a ton of co2 quickly rose to over 30 euros -lrb- $ 47.1 -rrb- , but collapsed when it was revealed in early 2006 that eu states had issued more permits than their factories had emitted co2 . in january , the commission proposed a series of amendments to the ets ' rules .
the most important proposals were to set a single , eu-wide cap on emissions permits rather than giving each member state an individual target , to make industry bid for permits at auction , and to include more types of industry in the ets . frustrated un official bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why should countries like south africa clean up their act if g8 countries do n't ?
the un 's top climate official on friday meanwhile also expressed his frustration over europe failing to take its place as a role model when it comes to fighting global warming . " we really need a push now from g8 countries to show leadership , " said yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , a day before environment ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nations were due to meet in kobe , japan . reaching a consensus on medium- and long-term goals for reducing greenhouse gases ahead of the g8 summit in july , also taking place in japan , would be " very difficult , " he predicted . de boer , in an unusual expression of frustration , was notably concerned that europe was softening its landmark commitments to cut greenhouse gases , thus sending the wrong signal to developing nations . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.05.2008 turkey 's nuclear power plans draw outrage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a negative track record , turkey wants to begin producing nuclear energy plans to build several new nuclear power plants have come up against hefty protest in turkey , which is still suffering the effects of the 1986 chernobyl meltdown .
turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .
just 10 years ago , a major earthquake occurred in nearby adana . the power plant will endanger not just turkey , but the whole world , warned gurbuz . susanne guesten -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their increase was partially offset by other countries decreasing their emissions . that revelation is likely to be a major embarrassment to the veteran member states , who in 2007 spearheaded an agreement to cut the bloc 's co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have every reason to be proud as far as their emissions are concerned it overturns the long-held assumption that it is the eu 's new member states , with their relatively fast-growing economies , who are likely to record the highest emissions growths . indeed , while new members estonia and the czech republic showed the highest emissions-growth rates in the eu , their fellow-newcomers cyprus , slovenia and hungary all recorded slower growth rates than eu veterans , including the netherlands , spain or greece . newcomers latvia , lithuania , poland and slovakia even managed to reduce their emissions in 2007 - despite economic growth rates which were among the fastest in the bloc . bargaining chip for brussels the results , which confirm preliminary reports from early april , are likely to strengthen the commission 's hand in negotiations to expand the trading scheme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavros dimas backs strict limits on emissions " studies show that emissions would most likely have been significantly higher without the eu trading scheme , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" however , the small rise last year further confirms the need for a strict emissions cap . " the emission trading scheme , or ets , was launched in 2005 as a way of making it more expensive to emit co2 , and thus to make it more cost-effective for factories to reduce their emissions . the price to emit a ton of co2 quickly rose to over 30 euros -lrb- $ 47.1 -rrb- , but collapsed when it was revealed in early 2006 that eu states had issued more permits than their factories had emitted co2 . in january , the commission proposed a series of amendments to the ets ' rules .
the most important proposals were to set a single , eu-wide cap on emissions permits rather than giving each member state an individual target , to make industry bid for permits at auction , and to include more types of industry in the ets . frustrated un official bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why should countries like south africa clean up their act if g8 countries do n't ?
the un 's top climate official on friday meanwhile also expressed his frustration over europe failing to take its place as a role model when it comes to fighting global warming . " we really need a push now from g8 countries to show leadership , " said yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , a day before environment ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nations were due to meet in kobe , japan . reaching a consensus on medium- and long-term goals for reducing greenhouse gases ahead of the g8 summit in july , also taking place in japan , would be " very difficult , " he predicted . de boer , in an unusual expression of frustration , was notably concerned that europe was softening its landmark commitments to cut greenhouse gases , thus sending the wrong signal to developing nations . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .
but whether we can or can not achieve that same level of traction - that is for people to find out and for the world to tell , but we certainly are going to try . i personally am going to try my hardest to get the awareness up and the toolkit available to people - at least to the layers that matter .
that is , the decision-making layers : the policy maker , the administrator , the businessman , and the consumer - you and me . what is your timetable for publicizing the results and then for continuing the work of the study ? to be totally frank with you , the results that we have today are largely for forest biomes , so clearly we need to expand our work there , and we need to make the evaluation work and the toolkit that we are preparing available in a realistic and reasonable format across the world .
it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .
we believe that everything we are doing has to be relevant to the end-users .
otherwise , it should not be done . we are very clear in our team that we do not re-invent the wheel , we do not do pure academia , we do not do only research for the sake of research , but we do research and compilation and assessments for the sake of putting it in the hands of people who make decisions : policymakers , administrators , the ceos of businesses , and perhaps most importantly , you and me as consumers . interview : irene quaile -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .
but whether we can or can not achieve that same level of traction - that is for people to find out and for the world to tell , but we certainly are going to try . i personally am going to try my hardest to get the awareness up and the toolkit available to people - at least to the layers that matter .
that is , the decision-making layers : the policy maker , the administrator , the businessman , and the consumer - you and me . what is your timetable for publicizing the results and then for continuing the work of the study ? to be totally frank with you , the results that we have today are largely for forest biomes , so clearly we need to expand our work there , and we need to make the evaluation work and the toolkit that we are preparing available in a realistic and reasonable format across the world .
it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .
we believe that everything we are doing has to be relevant to the end-users .
otherwise , it should not be done . we are very clear in our team that we do not re-invent the wheel , we do not do pure academia , we do not do only research for the sake of research , but we do research and compilation and assessments for the sake of putting it in the hands of people who make decisions : policymakers , administrators , the ceos of businesses , and perhaps most importantly , you and me as consumers . interview : irene quaile -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .
but whether we can or can not achieve that same level of traction - that is for people to find out and for the world to tell , but we certainly are going to try . i personally am going to try my hardest to get the awareness up and the toolkit available to people - at least to the layers that matter .
that is , the decision-making layers : the policy maker , the administrator , the businessman , and the consumer - you and me . what is your timetable for publicizing the results and then for continuing the work of the study ? to be totally frank with you , the results that we have today are largely for forest biomes , so clearly we need to expand our work there , and we need to make the evaluation work and the toolkit that we are preparing available in a realistic and reasonable format across the world .
it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .
we believe that everything we are doing has to be relevant to the end-users .
otherwise , it should not be done . we are very clear in our team that we do not re-invent the wheel , we do not do pure academia , we do not do only research for the sake of research , but we do research and compilation and assessments for the sake of putting it in the hands of people who make decisions : policymakers , administrators , the ceos of businesses , and perhaps most importantly , you and me as consumers . interview : irene quaile -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany contributed most in overall terms to the rise with additional emissions of 9 million tons .
but the country actually stayed below the maximum level of 498 million tons with a total of 487 million tons emitted . the netherlands emitted 3.2 million additional tons , but 10 percent less than their maximum allowance of nearly 80 million tons .
britain -lrb- 5.4 million tons -rrb- and spain -lrb- 6.8 million tons -rrb- on the other hand went above the maximum level by 2.1 and 3.8 percent respectively . embarrassing numbers between them , the quartet accounted for over two-thirds of the entire rise in emissions seen across the eu .
their increase was partially offset by other countries decreasing their emissions . that revelation is likely to be a major embarrassment to the veteran member states , who in 2007 spearheaded an agreement to cut the bloc 's co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have every reason to be proud as far as their emissions are concerned it overturns the long-held assumption that it is the eu 's new member states , with their relatively fast-growing economies , who are likely to record the highest emissions growths . indeed , while new members estonia and the czech republic showed the highest emissions-growth rates in the eu , their fellow-newcomers cyprus , slovenia and hungary all recorded slower growth rates than eu veterans , including the netherlands , spain or greece . newcomers latvia , lithuania , poland and slovakia even managed to reduce their emissions in 2007 - despite economic growth rates which were among the fastest in the bloc . bargaining chip for brussels the results , which confirm preliminary reports from early april , are likely to strengthen the commission 's hand in negotiations to expand the trading scheme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavros dimas backs strict limits on emissions " studies show that emissions would most likely have been significantly higher without the eu trading scheme , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" however , the small rise last year further confirms the need for a strict emissions cap . " the emission trading scheme , or ets , was launched in 2005 as a way of making it more expensive to emit co2 , and thus to make it more cost-effective for factories to reduce their emissions . the price to emit a ton of co2 quickly rose to over 30 euros -lrb- $ 47.1 -rrb- , but collapsed when it was revealed in early 2006 that eu states had issued more permits than their factories had emitted co2 . in january , the commission proposed a series of amendments to the ets ' rules .
the most important proposals were to set a single , eu-wide cap on emissions permits rather than giving each member state an individual target , to make industry bid for permits at auction , and to include more types of industry in the ets . frustrated un official bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why should countries like south africa clean up their act if g8 countries do n't ?

observers say the election was fairer than previous polls but still flawed . the georgian election commission said friday , may 23 , that pro-western president mikhail saakashvili 's united national movement won the parliamentary polls this week with 59.5 percent of the vote - trailed by the united opposition council with 17.7 percent .
the party won 120 of 150 parliamentary seats assigned by constituency and a crushing majority of the other half of the seats , allocated proportionally according to the national vote , the electoral commission said .
rigged but the opposition said the poll had been rigged and threatened protests and a parliamentary boycott .
" these elections do n't reflect the people 's choice and the people 's will .
we are not recognizing the results , " david gamkrelidze of the new rights party said in televised remarks .
" the opposition is seriously considering the possibility of boycotting the new parliament , " he said , echoing other opposition leaders .
scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .
the opposition supports joining nato in principle but has accused saakashvili of arrogance and of ignoring the plight of the poor . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.05.2008 turkey 's nuclear power plans draw outrage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a negative track record , turkey wants to begin producing nuclear energy plans to build several new nuclear power plants have come up against hefty protest in turkey , which is still suffering the effects of the 1986 chernobyl meltdown .
turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .
just 10 years ago , a major earthquake occurred in nearby adana . the power plant will endanger not just turkey , but the whole world , warned gurbuz . susanne guesten -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" however , the small rise last year further confirms the need for a strict emissions cap . " the emission trading scheme , or ets , was launched in 2005 as a way of making it more expensive to emit co2 , and thus to make it more cost-effective for factories to reduce their emissions . the price to emit a ton of co2 quickly rose to over 30 euros -lrb- $ 47.1 -rrb- , but collapsed when it was revealed in early 2006 that eu states had issued more permits than their factories had emitted co2 . in january , the commission proposed a series of amendments to the ets ' rules .
the most important proposals were to set a single , eu-wide cap on emissions permits rather than giving each member state an individual target , to make industry bid for permits at auction , and to include more types of industry in the ets . frustrated un official bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why should countries like south africa clean up their act if g8 countries do n't ?
the un 's top climate official on friday meanwhile also expressed his frustration over europe failing to take its place as a role model when it comes to fighting global warming . " we really need a push now from g8 countries to show leadership , " said yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , a day before environment ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nations were due to meet in kobe , japan . reaching a consensus on medium- and long-term goals for reducing greenhouse gases ahead of the g8 summit in july , also taking place in japan , would be " very difficult , " he predicted . de boer , in an unusual expression of frustration , was notably concerned that europe was softening its landmark commitments to cut greenhouse gases , thus sending the wrong signal to developing nations . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

observers say the election was fairer than previous polls but still flawed . the georgian election commission said friday , may 23 , that pro-western president mikhail saakashvili 's united national movement won the parliamentary polls this week with 59.5 percent of the vote - trailed by the united opposition council with 17.7 percent .
the party won 120 of 150 parliamentary seats assigned by constituency and a crushing majority of the other half of the seats , allocated proportionally according to the national vote , the electoral commission said .
rigged but the opposition said the poll had been rigged and threatened protests and a parliamentary boycott .
" these elections do n't reflect the people 's choice and the people 's will .
we are not recognizing the results , " david gamkrelidze of the new rights party said in televised remarks .
" the opposition is seriously considering the possibility of boycotting the new parliament , " he said , echoing other opposition leaders .
scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?
i hope , at least , as far as the quarter-final .
that for us would be a great achievement .
what does austria want to achieve as the host ?
if we are as successful as the germans in 2006 , we can be very content . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany contributed most in overall terms to the rise with additional emissions of 9 million tons .
but the country actually stayed below the maximum level of 498 million tons with a total of 487 million tons emitted . the netherlands emitted 3.2 million additional tons , but 10 percent less than their maximum allowance of nearly 80 million tons .
britain -lrb- 5.4 million tons -rrb- and spain -lrb- 6.8 million tons -rrb- on the other hand went above the maximum level by 2.1 and 3.8 percent respectively . embarrassing numbers between them , the quartet accounted for over two-thirds of the entire rise in emissions seen across the eu .
their increase was partially offset by other countries decreasing their emissions . that revelation is likely to be a major embarrassment to the veteran member states , who in 2007 spearheaded an agreement to cut the bloc 's co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have every reason to be proud as far as their emissions are concerned it overturns the long-held assumption that it is the eu 's new member states , with their relatively fast-growing economies , who are likely to record the highest emissions growths . indeed , while new members estonia and the czech republic showed the highest emissions-growth rates in the eu , their fellow-newcomers cyprus , slovenia and hungary all recorded slower growth rates than eu veterans , including the netherlands , spain or greece . newcomers latvia , lithuania , poland and slovakia even managed to reduce their emissions in 2007 - despite economic growth rates which were among the fastest in the bloc . bargaining chip for brussels the results , which confirm preliminary reports from early april , are likely to strengthen the commission 's hand in negotiations to expand the trading scheme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavros dimas backs strict limits on emissions " studies show that emissions would most likely have been significantly higher without the eu trading scheme , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" however , the small rise last year further confirms the need for a strict emissions cap . " the emission trading scheme , or ets , was launched in 2005 as a way of making it more expensive to emit co2 , and thus to make it more cost-effective for factories to reduce their emissions . the price to emit a ton of co2 quickly rose to over 30 euros -lrb- $ 47.1 -rrb- , but collapsed when it was revealed in early 2006 that eu states had issued more permits than their factories had emitted co2 . in january , the commission proposed a series of amendments to the ets ' rules .
the most important proposals were to set a single , eu-wide cap on emissions permits rather than giving each member state an individual target , to make industry bid for permits at auction , and to include more types of industry in the ets . frustrated un official bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why should countries like south africa clean up their act if g8 countries do n't ?
the un 's top climate official on friday meanwhile also expressed his frustration over europe failing to take its place as a role model when it comes to fighting global warming . " we really need a push now from g8 countries to show leadership , " said yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , a day before environment ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nations were due to meet in kobe , japan . reaching a consensus on medium- and long-term goals for reducing greenhouse gases ahead of the g8 summit in july , also taking place in japan , would be " very difficult , " he predicted . de boer , in an unusual expression of frustration , was notably concerned that europe was softening its landmark commitments to cut greenhouse gases , thus sending the wrong signal to developing nations . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

citigroup has suffered heavily from the meltdown in the us subprime - high risk - mortgage sector and has been looking to sell assets as a result . commerzbank , has also expressed an interest in citibank , which has 3.25 million customers and 340 branches in germany .
citibank would provide any new owner with a chance to boost its presence in the retail banking sector . a citibank spokesman refused to comment on the report , apart from recalling that citigroup is considering different options for its retail banking operations in germany .
deutsche bank likewise had no comment . stock market reacts to rumors postbank shares meanswhile rose 1.2 percent on thursday while commerzbank shares rose 2.4 percent after reports on the planned takeover .

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?
i hope , at least , as far as the quarter-final .
that for us would be a great achievement .
what does austria want to achieve as the host ?
if we are as successful as the germans in 2006 , we can be very content . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .
but whether we can or can not achieve that same level of traction - that is for people to find out and for the world to tell , but we certainly are going to try . i personally am going to try my hardest to get the awareness up and the toolkit available to people - at least to the layers that matter .
that is , the decision-making layers : the policy maker , the administrator , the businessman , and the consumer - you and me . what is your timetable for publicizing the results and then for continuing the work of the study ? to be totally frank with you , the results that we have today are largely for forest biomes , so clearly we need to expand our work there , and we need to make the evaluation work and the toolkit that we are preparing available in a realistic and reasonable format across the world .
it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .
we believe that everything we are doing has to be relevant to the end-users .
otherwise , it should not be done . we are very clear in our team that we do not re-invent the wheel , we do not do pure academia , we do not do only research for the sake of research , but we do research and compilation and assessments for the sake of putting it in the hands of people who make decisions : policymakers , administrators , the ceos of businesses , and perhaps most importantly , you and me as consumers . interview : irene quaile -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .
just 10 years ago , a major earthquake occurred in nearby adana . the power plant will endanger not just turkey , but the whole world , warned gurbuz . susanne guesten -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debate on the eu 's " return directive " comes at a sensitive time for europe , with some governments seeking to crack down on the seemingly unstoppable flow of africans and asians who continue to enter their territories illegally .
this week , the conservative italian government of silvio berlusconi launched a major anti-immigration push when it said it would join other european countries such as france in making illegal immigration a criminal offence punishable by jail .
the move has infuriated another mediterranean country , spain , which fears that it will induce would-be immigrants coming from africa to try and reach its territory instead .
non-binding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi plans to get tough on immigrants member states have been wrangling over the maximum period immigrants can be kept in detention for almost three years .
earlier this month , over 10 countries voiced opposition to a draft law .
the latest deal on the return directive was brokered by the slovenian presidency of the eu and also regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants , re-admission to their country of origin and access by non-governmental organizations to eu detention centers .
the draft agreed by eu ambassadors on thursday does not force governments to pay for an illegal immigrant 's legal aid , as some had wanted .
instead , it includes a non-binding invitation to governments to set aside the necessary funds needed to assist destitute migrants .
opposition the package will next month be voted on by the european parliament .
but its passage is threatened by reservations voiced by the second-largest political bloc in the parliament , the socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detention is seen by many as inhumane they say the six-month detention period is too long .
further opposition has come from the non-governmental sector .
according to the european council on refugees and exiles , detention should only ever be a last resort .
" we consider that systematic detention of people who have committed no crime , including families and vulnerable persons , is inhumane and unwarranted , " the ngo has said .

observers say the election was fairer than previous polls but still flawed . the georgian election commission said friday , may 23 , that pro-western president mikhail saakashvili 's united national movement won the parliamentary polls this week with 59.5 percent of the vote - trailed by the united opposition council with 17.7 percent .
the party won 120 of 150 parliamentary seats assigned by constituency and a crushing majority of the other half of the seats , allocated proportionally according to the national vote , the electoral commission said .
rigged but the opposition said the poll had been rigged and threatened protests and a parliamentary boycott .
" these elections do n't reflect the people 's choice and the people 's will .
we are not recognizing the results , " david gamkrelidze of the new rights party said in televised remarks .
" the opposition is seriously considering the possibility of boycotting the new parliament , " he said , echoing other opposition leaders .
scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .
the opposition supports joining nato in principle but has accused saakashvili of arrogance and of ignoring the plight of the poor . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .
just 10 years ago , a major earthquake occurred in nearby adana . the power plant will endanger not just turkey , but the whole world , warned gurbuz . susanne guesten -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?
i hope , at least , as far as the quarter-final .
that for us would be a great achievement .

the debate on the eu 's " return directive " comes at a sensitive time for europe , with some governments seeking to crack down on the seemingly unstoppable flow of africans and asians who continue to enter their territories illegally .
this week , the conservative italian government of silvio berlusconi launched a major anti-immigration push when it said it would join other european countries such as france in making illegal immigration a criminal offence punishable by jail .
the move has infuriated another mediterranean country , spain , which fears that it will induce would-be immigrants coming from africa to try and reach its territory instead .
non-binding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi plans to get tough on immigrants member states have been wrangling over the maximum period immigrants can be kept in detention for almost three years .
earlier this month , over 10 countries voiced opposition to a draft law .
the latest deal on the return directive was brokered by the slovenian presidency of the eu and also regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants , re-admission to their country of origin and access by non-governmental organizations to eu detention centers .
the draft agreed by eu ambassadors on thursday does not force governments to pay for an illegal immigrant 's legal aid , as some had wanted .
instead , it includes a non-binding invitation to governments to set aside the necessary funds needed to assist destitute migrants .
opposition the package will next month be voted on by the european parliament .
but its passage is threatened by reservations voiced by the second-largest political bloc in the parliament , the socialists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detention is seen by many as inhumane they say the six-month detention period is too long .
further opposition has come from the non-governmental sector .
according to the european council on refugees and exiles , detention should only ever be a last resort .
" we consider that systematic detention of people who have committed no crime , including families and vulnerable persons , is inhumane and unwarranted , " the ngo has said .
this is the first time that the european parliament has been given a decisive voice on immigration , an issue normally reserved to member states . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .

the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .

" said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?
i hope , at least , as far as the quarter-final .
that for us would be a great achievement .
what does austria want to achieve as the host ?
if we are as successful as the germans in 2006 , we can be very content . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

scrutinized the elections were intensely scrutinized by outside powers as georgia is engaged in a stand-off with its soviet-era master russia over two separatist georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia .
a number of eu states rallied to saakashvili 's side after the election that international observers described as an improvement on previous polls but still flawed .
election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said thursday that georgia had clearly intended a democratic vote but that there had been " problems , " including intimidation of voters .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country currently holds the european union presidency , described the vote as " encouraging . "
the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said the elections showed " substantial progress . "
the presidents of lithuania and poland , countries that were under moscow 's control in the soviet era , also praised the vote .
" important step " berlin said the elections represented an " important step " towards democracy and called on all parties to work together to press ahead with reforms .
" the government congratulates the people of georgia on the peaceful and on the whole fair elections ...
with this , georgia has made a further important step towards a democratic society , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said .
" after this intensive and at times strongly polarizing vote we call on all political powers in georgia to work constructively together in parliament to implement its reform work , " he added .
he said that although the election was not " free of imperfections " there was a " significant improvement " compared to presidential elections in january .
pro-western georgian officials cast the international criticism in a positive light , saying the observers must be applying higher standards as the country moves closer to western-style democracy .
when he came to power in 2004 , saakashvili was initially hailed as a reformer , but was criticized last november after sending riot police to suppress an opposition protest , shutting a critical television station and briefly imposing emergency rule .
georgia has long sought western support in its stand-off with russia and this week 's vote was seen a test of its ability to meet democratic standards .
ahead of the election , saakashvili said georgia had come close to war in its dispute with russia over the separatist territories .
behind the dispute lies his pro-western course and drive to join nato , analysts say .
the opposition supports joining nato in principle but has accused saakashvili of arrogance and of ignoring the plight of the poor . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?
i hope , at least , as far as the quarter-final .
that for us would be a great achievement .
what does austria want to achieve as the host ?
if we are as successful as the germans in 2006 , we can be very content . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the treaty aims to make the 27-member bloc more efficient . the bundesrat approved the new eu treaty on friday , may 23 . the vote was its last legislative hurdle in the 27-nation bloc 's most populous country . the bundesrat represents the country 's 16 state governments .
all but one voted in favor . the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , last month overwhelmingly backed the treaty by 514 votes for to 58 against , with one abstention from berlin . by abstaining , mayor klaus wowereit effectively voted ' no ' but thereby averted a stand-off within the berlin government between his own social democrat party and its coalition partner , the left party . the left draws most of its support in the former communist east of the country , and sees the treaty as opposed to its social policies . wowereit was sharply critical of his coalition partner .
party leader oskar lafontaine had demonstrated that " the left is not capable or ready to be in government at federal level , " the mayor said ahead of the vote . the 53 members of the left made up the bulk of the opposition during the bundestag 's vote last month . some of them have signalled they might now mount a constitutional challenge to the treaty through the courts . a " new foundation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit staved off a crisis in his government chancellor angela merkel , who was one of the main drivers of the process leading up to the slimmed down treaty , described it as " good for europe " and a " win for germany " - and said it creates " nothing less than a new foundation for europe . " only president horst koehler 's signature is now required to complete ratification . the treaty was signed in the portuguese capital on dec .
13 .
it replaces the failed european constitution , which was abandoned after the french and dutch rejected it in referenda in 2005 . the 27 eu member states are being asked to ratify the treaty by the end of the year , ahead of elections to the european parliament in 2009 .
ireland is to hold a referendum on the treaty in june - the only country to do so . the treaty , a complex legal document comprising a string of amendments to previous eu deals , aims to streamline decision-making through increased use of majority votes and creates the offices of an eu president and foreign policy supremo with clout . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .
just 10 years ago , a major earthquake occurred in nearby adana . the power plant will endanger not just turkey , but the whole world , warned gurbuz . susanne guesten -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's nuclear authority has lost its credibility . this spring , turkey 's energy ministry called for bids for the construction of the country 's first nuclear power plant , to be built in akkuyu near mersin on the mediterranean sea .
plans for a second plant in sinop , on the black sea , are already in the works . the project is facing considerable resistance in both places . chernobyl aftermath many in turkey are afraid of a meltdown similar to what happened in chernobyl in april 1986 .
turkey 's black sea coast was completely contaminated by the fallout from the ukrainian nuclear reactor .
the turkish authorities ' lax approach to the radioactive danger only exacerbated the damage . " the government told us we could eat and drink everything without worrying about it , " said sukru dogan , a trader in istanbul . the responsible minister even drank a cup of tea on television and said that a little radiation never hurt anyone - just to spare the next tea harvest .
then president turgut ozal claimed in all seriousness that radioactive tea tasted better , and local farmers were left in the lurch with their radioactive crops . " what were we supposed to do , we had to eat something - and everything was contaminated , " said hazelnut farmer gonul erdern .
now all of her relatives have cancer , and the hospitals in the black sea region are overflowing with cancer patients . after having been personally affected by the chernobyl disaster , many turks do n't ever want to have anything to do with nuclear power . bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in chernobyl is pictured here in 1996 lost trust melda keskin , the author of the most in-depth report on the effects of chernobyl in turkey , said the government itself was to blame for the people 's attitude . " if we had followed even the simplest precautionary measures , if we had just washed the tea , then people would have come into much less contact with radiation , " she said . confidence in the turkish nuclear energy authority is very low , though the body is to oversee the building of the country 's new nuclear power plants .
the first one in akkuyu is scheduled to go online in five to six years , much to the chagrin of turkish energy expert ozgur gurbuz . there 's no other agency on earth that should be kept further away from a nuclear power plant than the turkish nuclear energy authority , said gurbuz . even without its own nuclear plant , the turkish authority was implicated several years ago in a fatal accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had to get involved in the calamity , which occurred when cobalt intended for medical purposes landed in a junkyard . " a government that ca n't keep 20 grams of atomic material under control now wants to build three nuclear power plants ? " said gurbuz . seismic danger construction on the first plant in akkuyu is slated to begin this year , if everything runs according to plan at the energy ministry . the fact that akkuyu is located in an earthquake-prone region is yet another reason for concern for the project 's opponents .
just 10 years ago , a major earthquake occurred in nearby adana . the power plant will endanger not just turkey , but the whole world , warned gurbuz . susanne guesten -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the treaty aims to make the 27-member bloc more efficient . the bundesrat approved the new eu treaty on friday , may 23 . the vote was its last legislative hurdle in the 27-nation bloc 's most populous country . the bundesrat represents the country 's 16 state governments .
all but one voted in favor . the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , last month overwhelmingly backed the treaty by 514 votes for to 58 against , with one abstention from berlin . by abstaining , mayor klaus wowereit effectively voted ' no ' but thereby averted a stand-off within the berlin government between his own social democrat party and its coalition partner , the left party . the left draws most of its support in the former communist east of the country , and sees the treaty as opposed to its social policies . wowereit was sharply critical of his coalition partner .
party leader oskar lafontaine had demonstrated that " the left is not capable or ready to be in government at federal level , " the mayor said ahead of the vote . the 53 members of the left made up the bulk of the opposition during the bundestag 's vote last month . some of them have signalled they might now mount a constitutional challenge to the treaty through the courts . a " new foundation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit staved off a crisis in his government chancellor angela merkel , who was one of the main drivers of the process leading up to the slimmed down treaty , described it as " good for europe " and a " win for germany " - and said it creates " nothing less than a new foundation for europe . " only president horst koehler 's signature is now required to complete ratification . the treaty was signed in the portuguese capital on dec .
13 .
it replaces the failed european constitution , which was abandoned after the french and dutch rejected it in referenda in 2005 . the 27 eu member states are being asked to ratify the treaty by the end of the year , ahead of elections to the european parliament in 2009 .
ireland is to hold a referendum on the treaty in june - the only country to do so . the treaty , a complex legal document comprising a string of amendments to previous eu deals , aims to streamline decision-making through increased use of majority votes and creates the offices of an eu president and foreign policy supremo with clout . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?
i hope , at least , as far as the quarter-final .
that for us would be a great achievement .
what does austria want to achieve as the host ?
if we are as successful as the germans in 2006 , we can be very content . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 23.05.2008 old members pollute the most as eu emissions rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could do more to cut emissions industrial emissions of carbon dioxide in the european union rose in 2007 despite eu schemes to cut them , with the eu 's wealthiest and oldest members leading the surge , the bloc 's executive said friday . the rise was slower than the pace of eu economic growth , indicating that the fledgling emissions-reduction scheme is still having an impact , the european commission said in a statement . according to the commission , the more than 11,000 factories , power plants and smelters in the eu emitted 2.05 billion tons of co2 - the gas most associated with global warming - in 2007 , 16 million tons more than in 2006 , or an increase of 0.8 percent . this means that the permitted maximum level of 2.15 billion tons was actually not reached .
germany contributed most in overall terms to the rise with additional emissions of 9 million tons .
but the country actually stayed below the maximum level of 498 million tons with a total of 487 million tons emitted . the netherlands emitted 3.2 million additional tons , but 10 percent less than their maximum allowance of nearly 80 million tons .
britain -lrb- 5.4 million tons -rrb- and spain -lrb- 6.8 million tons -rrb- on the other hand went above the maximum level by 2.1 and 3.8 percent respectively . embarrassing numbers between them , the quartet accounted for over two-thirds of the entire rise in emissions seen across the eu .
their increase was partially offset by other countries decreasing their emissions . that revelation is likely to be a major embarrassment to the veteran member states , who in 2007 spearheaded an agreement to cut the bloc 's co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have every reason to be proud as far as their emissions are concerned it overturns the long-held assumption that it is the eu 's new member states , with their relatively fast-growing economies , who are likely to record the highest emissions growths . indeed , while new members estonia and the czech republic showed the highest emissions-growth rates in the eu , their fellow-newcomers cyprus , slovenia and hungary all recorded slower growth rates than eu veterans , including the netherlands , spain or greece . newcomers latvia , lithuania , poland and slovakia even managed to reduce their emissions in 2007 - despite economic growth rates which were among the fastest in the bloc . bargaining chip for brussels the results , which confirm preliminary reports from early april , are likely to strengthen the commission 's hand in negotiations to expand the trading scheme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavros dimas backs strict limits on emissions " studies show that emissions would most likely have been significantly higher without the eu trading scheme , " said eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" however , the small rise last year further confirms the need for a strict emissions cap . " the emission trading scheme , or ets , was launched in 2005 as a way of making it more expensive to emit co2 , and thus to make it more cost-effective for factories to reduce their emissions . the price to emit a ton of co2 quickly rose to over 30 euros -lrb- $ 47.1 -rrb- , but collapsed when it was revealed in early 2006 that eu states had issued more permits than their factories had emitted co2 . in january , the commission proposed a series of amendments to the ets ' rules .

dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .
but whether we can or can not achieve that same level of traction - that is for people to find out and for the world to tell , but we certainly are going to try . i personally am going to try my hardest to get the awareness up and the toolkit available to people - at least to the layers that matter .
that is , the decision-making layers : the policy maker , the administrator , the businessman , and the consumer - you and me . what is your timetable for publicizing the results and then for continuing the work of the study ? to be totally frank with you , the results that we have today are largely for forest biomes , so clearly we need to expand our work there , and we need to make the evaluation work and the toolkit that we are preparing available in a realistic and reasonable format across the world .
it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .
we believe that everything we are doing has to be relevant to the end-users .
otherwise , it should not be done . we are very clear in our team that we do not re-invent the wheel , we do not do pure academia , we do not do only research for the sake of research , but we do research and compilation and assessments for the sake of putting it in the hands of people who make decisions : policymakers , administrators , the ceos of businesses , and perhaps most importantly , you and me as consumers . interview : irene quaile -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he signed a professional contract with the club at the start of the 2007/08 season and played eight senior games in the bundesliga , scoring one goal .
he was called up to the senior austrian squad in 2007 after two years with his country 's youth teams .
dw-world.de : martin harnik , you are , as an austrian , one of the hosts of the european championship .
what do you expect this summer ?
martin harnik : after the world cup in germany two years ago , everyone expects a lot from this event .
we want , of course , to be a very good host and hope for some very good games .
will the atmosphere be as unbelievable at euro 2008 in austria as it was at the 2006 world cup in germany ?
this is hard to say of course because first : this is a european championship and not a world cup , and secondly : the european championship is shared between switzerland and austria .
so , i think the mood will not be as extreme as it was in germany .
you 've played in germany with werder bremen for a few years now .
is your experience as a bundesliga player important for your national team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harnik -lrb- arms raised -rrb- celebrates his first bremen goal yes .
to play with werder bremen is an advantage because we play very fast soccer and always try in training to play a very direct game .
so , i hope i bring that tempo to the national team .
also , i am 20 years old and i can still learn a lot from the players of the national team .
you know the german players and german soccer quite well .
is this situation an advantage for you ?
yes , clearly it is an advantage if one knows the opponents even better than others .
but i think before euro 2008 , we will analyze every opponent in detail , over and over again , then each of our players will know exactly every opposing player .
it is an advantage for me , but also one my colleagues on the national team can benefit from .
the friendly game against group rival germany in february resulted in defeat for austria .
could things be different at the european championships ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany beat austria 3-0 in vienna in february this year we hope of course that we can do better at euro 2008 .
but even though we lost , on the whole we can be content with that game against the germans , because in the first half we played strongly and actually controlled the game .
only the goals were missing .
we have a few games coming up and so i think we can go into the tournament and perform much better .
the game in february was just a friendly .
however , the next time you play germany on june 16 , the outcome will be very important for both teams .
how do you think it will go ?
of course there are two other very important tournament games but the best situation would be that when we play germany , both teams will be through to the next round .
regardless of this , the game will of course be a highlight and as i said , i think we will be much better and we should perform better .
i think we will do this .
which is your most dangerous opponent in the group : poland , croatia or germany ?
these are all very strong opponents , but none of them are guaranteed to qualify for the next round .
the three games will be very hard because every team wants to win and every team is there to advance .
we have the advantage of being at home at the championships and we will of course want to get through the group to the quarter-finals .
how far do you think austria will go in the tournament ?
i hope , at least , as far as the quarter-final .
that for us would be a great achievement .
what does austria want to achieve as the host ?
if we are as successful as the germans in 2006 , we can be very content . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio spoke to the report 's lead author . the eu commission and the german government have organized a study called " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , which has been compared to the stern report on the cost of climate change .
the first part of the teeb report is to be published at the un convention on biodiversity meeting in bonn next week .
dw-radio spoke with pavan sukhdev , teeb project leader and deutsche bank manager . dw-radio : mr. sukhdev , what is the main message of the study ? pavan sukhdev : we certainly have found in our initial review of biomes and habitats , like forests , that there are very large values being lost today , which would make a significant dent in people 's welfare and wellbeing .
we are talking about several percentage points of gdp , if you want to compare it to gdp . what would you tell people to convince them that this is something to take action on now ? i ’ ll tell them that food and water are at risk .
i 'll tell them that the 6 to 8 percent of gdp just on forests that we 're talking about is actually the total livelihood of 2 billion of the world 's poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fisheries close , food and income have to be found elsewhere i 'll tell them that the fisheries that are basically going to die out in 40 years time do n't just mean $ 80 to 100 billion worth of lost fishing income , but also lost protein for the world 's billion poorest people .
how are you going to cure the problem of health for these people ? how are you going to provide income and a livelihood to the 2 billion poorest who depend on this ? these are massive problems .
these are the human problems behind the numbers that people have to be aware of . as always , the poorest of the poor will be hit the worst , but how is this message going to affect the developed , industrialized world ? very significantly .
growth has to come from below .
if we look today at the risks of climate change and the opportunities created by it , if we look today at the need to achieve sustainability , and the business opportunities created by moving from unsustainable to sustainable businesses - that represents a massive shift in employment . most of the technology that drives that shift is from the developed world and most of the new jobs that will be benefiting from that shift are in the developed world .
if they do n't get this , then they will be losing probably their largest opportunity to have a new industrial revolution of sorts , a revolution equivalent to the old industrial revolution , where sustainability and climate change and biodiversity create the new opportunities for the future . so the question is who is going to get there first ?
the developed world or some random few countries here and there ?
i think this is very important for the developed world . very high expectations have been put on your report and some people are saying this will do what the stern report did for climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the developed world has to act , said sukhdev firstly , i 'm honored by that comparison because lord stern is a member of our advisory board as well .
but whether we can or can not achieve that same level of traction - that is for people to find out and for the world to tell , but we certainly are going to try . i personally am going to try my hardest to get the awareness up and the toolkit available to people - at least to the layers that matter .
that is , the decision-making layers : the policy maker , the administrator , the businessman , and the consumer - you and me . what is your timetable for publicizing the results and then for continuing the work of the study ? to be totally frank with you , the results that we have today are largely for forest biomes , so clearly we need to expand our work there , and we need to make the evaluation work and the toolkit that we are preparing available in a realistic and reasonable format across the world .
it 's not only for forest-rich countries . it will probably take another year and a half .
what we have right now is an interim report , which will be released on may 29 in bonn . what you will see in a year 's time is a more detailed , first draft report , which will be sent out to all the end users for their feedback .
we believe that everything we are doing has to be relevant to the end-users .
otherwise , it should not be done . we are very clear in our team that we do not re-invent the wheel , we do not do pure academia , we do not do only research for the sake of research , but we do research and compilation and assessments for the sake of putting it in the hands of people who make decisions : policymakers , administrators , the ceos of businesses , and perhaps most importantly , you and me as consumers . interview : irene quaile -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the good beach guide - which is compiled by mcs based on water quality - has blamed the impact of storm pollution during 2007 's wet summer .
the mcs said the number of resorts in wales failing to reach the minimum legal standard had almost doubled .
two welsh beaches - amroth in pembrokeshire and aberdyfi in gwynedd went from recommended to failed .
the bathing water tests were conducted from may to september 2007 by the mcs , a charity which aims to protect seas , shores and wildlife , and 102 out of the 178 beaches tested in wales were recommended by them .
this is a 2 % drop on last year . "
when you get flash floods this leads to a larger amount of pollution going into the sea " gill bell , mcs welsh officer beaches failing the minimum legal standard went from 8 to 15 .
gill bell , mcs welsh officer , said they were concerned by the results but they believed it was due to storm related pollution .
" last year was a very wet year , " she said .
" when you get flash floods this leads to a larger amount of pollution going into the sea . "
" all of that can influence whether a beach passes our water quality tests . "
the mcs said welsh beaches were particularly vulnerable to storm pollution run-off from farm land which carries material like fertilisers and animal waste into the sea .
there are also a high number of combined sewer overflows intermittently discharging raw sewage to the coasts of north and south wales which need upgrading if water quality is to further improve , it said .
the organisation said it fully supported welsh water 's investment programme and hoped that plans by the assembly government , the environment agency and the green sea initiative would lead to future improvements in bathing water quality .
ms bell said it was not known why the water quality at amroth was not good enough .
" amroth is one of the beaches that went from recommended to failed in a year .
it has been awarded the blue flag in the past and normally it has good water quality , " she said .
both amroth and aberdyfi beaches were stripped of their european blue flag status for water quality in november 2007 .
however aberavon beach near port talbot , which has just been awarded the blue flag , has gone from a fail in 2007 to a recommendation .
the mcs recommendations are one of five uk awards for seafronts and is the only scheme which focuses entirely on water quality .
the beaches are categorised as failing if they fail the ec statutory minimum , " pass " if they pass it , " guideline " if their water quality is good and are awarded an mcs recommendation where the water quality is high and there is good sewage treatment .
blue flags , another beach award , assesses how well the beach is managed and its amenities .

the good beach guide - which is compiled by mcs based on water quality - has blamed the impact of storm pollution during 2007 's wet summer .
the mcs said the number of resorts in wales failing to reach the minimum legal standard had almost doubled .
two welsh beaches - amroth in pembrokeshire and aberdyfi in gwynedd went from recommended to failed .
the bathing water tests were conducted from may to september 2007 by the mcs , a charity which aims to protect seas , shores and wildlife , and 102 out of the 178 beaches tested in wales were recommended by them .
this is a 2 % drop on last year .
when you get flash floods this leads to a larger amount of pollution going into the sea gill bell , mcs welsh officer beaches failing the minimum legal standard went from 8 to 15 .
gill bell , mcs welsh officer , said they were concerned by the results but they believed it was due to storm related pollution .
" last year was a very wet year , " she said .
" when you get flash floods this leads to a larger amount of pollution going into the sea . "
" all of that can influence whether a beach passes our water quality tests . "
the mcs said welsh beaches were particularly vulnerable to storm pollution run-off from farm land which carries material like fertilisers and animal waste into the sea .
there are also a high number of combined sewer overflows intermittently discharging raw sewage to the coasts of north and south wales which need upgrading if water quality is to further improve , it said .
aberavon beach has just been awarded the prestigious blue flag the organisation said it fully supported welsh water 's investment programme and hoped that plans by the assembly government , the environment agency and the green sea initiative would lead to future improvements in bathing water quality .
ms bell said it was not known why the water quality at amroth was not good enough .
" amroth is one of the beaches that went from recommended to failed in a year .
it has been awarded the blue flag in the past and normally it has good water quality , " she said .
both amroth and aberdyfi beaches were stripped of their european blue flag status for water quality in november 2007 .
however aberavon beach near port talbot , which has just been awarded the blue flag , has gone from a fail in 2007 to a recommendation .
the mcs recommendations are one of five uk awards for seafronts and is the only scheme which focuses entirely on water quality .
the beaches are categorised as failing if they fail the ec statutory minimum , " pass " if they pass it , " guideline " if their water quality is good and are awarded an mcs recommendation where the water quality is high and there is good sewage treatment .
blue flags , another beach award , assesses how well the beach is managed and its amenities .

analysis by james landale chief political correspondent , bbc news channel what is likely to be the fall-out from the conservative party 's first by-election gain from labour in 30 years ?
gordon brown 's future as prime minister now hangs on two things - the response of labour mps to the party 's historic and overwhelming defeat in crewe and nantwich and his own analysis of why thousands of former labour voters in this cheshire constituency gave their support to the conservatives .
some labour mps will panic , perhaps even going so far as to call for mr brown 's head in public .
most though think a move against mr brown is unlikely in the short term , not least because there is no obvious successor and any leadership contest would be divisive and damaging .
but the size of the tory majority in crewe and the scale of the swing against labour will prompt some mps to wonder if their jobs might be safer under a new leader .
people are already talking of things coming to a head at the autumn party conference if things do not get better .
so much for the mps , now for the post-match analysis .
first the campaign .
it was poor and clumsy .
the class war tactics against the so-called tory " toff " candidate backfired , portraying labour as negative and anti-aspirational .
nor did the choice of gwyneth dunwoody 's daughter , tamsin , as labour 's candidate , pay off .
in the end she won more hugs than votes .
yet a poor campaign did not lose this seat for labour .
the real causes for labour 's defeat were the economy and voters ' doubts about gordon brown .
prices are rising , people in crewe are feeling the pinch , but they appear unsure what the government was doing about it .
they disliked paying more tax as a result of the 10p rate abolition , and the compensation package came too late to have an impact .
voters also used the ' 10p issue ' as a proxy to voice their concerns about mr brown .
he did not campaign , his name did not appear on labour leaflets .
but the tory slogan urging voters to " send a message to gordon brown " clearly resonated .
so what might mr brown do ?
on the economy the prime minister is expected to look at more short term help to support those suffering most from the economic downturn .
that will need cash , which he does not have , so long term investment budgets in the public services might be plundered while he waits for the economy to improve .
virtuous circle as for the man himself ?
he is clearly not going to go voluntarily , a putsch is unlikely and all attempts at another makeover look implausible .
but the aim somehow would be to restore mr brown 's reputation as a safe , competent , prudent ex-chancellor who can steer us through the slowdown .
as for the tories , does their victory show they are on course to win the next general election ?
no .
by-election results are notoriously poor predictors of national poll outcomes .
but by-elections , particularly historically important ones like this , can have a huge impact .
the result will boost conservative party morale .

analysis by james landale chief political correspondent , bbc news channel labour 's class war campaign tactics backfired in crewe and nantwich what is likely to be the fall-out from the conservative party 's first by-election gain from labour in 30 years ?
gordon brown 's future as prime minister now hangs on two things - the response of labour mps to the party 's historic and overwhelming defeat in crewe and nantwich and his own analysis of why thousands of former labour voters in this cheshire constituency gave their support to the conservatives .
some labour mps will panic , perhaps even going so far as to call for mr brown 's head in public .
most though think a move against mr brown is unlikely in the short term , not least because there is no obvious successor and any leadership contest would be divisive and damaging .
but the size of the tory majority in crewe and the scale of the swing against labour will prompt some mps to wonder if their jobs might be safer under a new leader .
people are already talking of things coming to a head at the autumn party conference if things do not get better .
so much for the mps , now for the post-match analysis .
first the campaign .
it was poor and clumsy .
the class war tactics against the so-called tory " toff " candidate backfired , portraying labour as negative and anti-aspirational .
mr brown did not campaign in crewe and nantwich nor did the choice of gwyneth dunwoody 's daughter , tamsin , as labour 's candidate , pay off .
in the end she won more hugs than votes .
yet a poor campaign did not lose this seat for labour .
the real causes for labour 's defeat were the economy and voters ' doubts about gordon brown .
prices are rising , people in crewe are feeling the pinch , but they appear unsure what the government was doing about it .
they disliked paying more tax as a result of the 10p rate abolition , and the compensation package came too late to have an impact .
voters also used the ' 10p issue ' as a proxy to voice their concerns about mr brown .
he did not campaign , his name did not appear on labour leaflets .
but the tory slogan urging voters to " send a message to gordon brown " clearly resonated .
so what might mr brown do ?
on the economy the prime minister is expected to look at more short term help to support those suffering most from the economic downturn .
that will need cash , which he does not have , so long term investment budgets in the public services might be plundered while he waits for the economy to improve .
virtuous circle as for the man himself ?
he is clearly not going to go voluntarily , a putsch is unlikely and all attempts at another makeover look implausible .
but the aim somehow would be to restore mr brown 's reputation as a safe , competent , prudent ex-chancellor who can steer us through the slowdown .
as for the tories , does their victory show they are on course to win the next general election ?
no .
by-election results are notoriously poor predictors of national poll outcomes .
but by-elections , particularly historically important ones like this , can have a huge impact .
the result will boost conservative party morale .
it will encourage financial donors , but above all it will make the tories appear more clearly in the minds of voters as a potential future government .
in other words there is a virtuous circle here of success breeding success .

analysis by james landale chief political correspondent , bbc news channel labour 's class war campaign tactics backfired in crewe and nantwich what is likely to be the fall-out from the conservative party 's first by-election gain from labour in 30 years ?
gordon brown 's future as prime minister now hangs on two things - the response of labour mps to the party 's historic and overwhelming defeat in crewe and nantwich and his own analysis of why thousands of former labour voters in this cheshire constituency gave their support to the conservatives .
some labour mps will panic , perhaps even going so far as to call for mr brown 's head in public .
most though think a move against mr brown is unlikely in the short term , not least because there is no obvious successor and any leadership contest would be divisive and damaging .
but the size of the tory majority in crewe and the scale of the swing against labour will prompt some mps to wonder if their jobs might be safer under a new leader .
people are already talking of things coming to a head at the autumn party conference if things do not get better .
so much for the mps , now for the post-match analysis .
first the campaign .
it was poor and clumsy .
the class war tactics against the so-called tory " toff " candidate backfired , portraying labour as negative and anti-aspirational .
mr brown did not campaign in crewe and nantwich nor did the choice of gwyneth dunwoody 's daughter , tamsin , as labour 's candidate , pay off .
in the end she won more hugs than votes .
yet a poor campaign did not lose this seat for labour .
the real causes for labour 's defeat were the economy and voters ' doubts about gordon brown .
prices are rising , people in crewe are feeling the pinch , but they appear unsure what the government was doing about it .
they disliked paying more tax as a result of the 10p rate abolition , and the compensation package came too late to have an impact .
voters also used the ' 10p issue ' as a proxy to voice their concerns about mr brown .
he did not campaign , his name did not appear on labour leaflets .
but the tory slogan urging voters to " send a message to gordon brown " clearly resonated .
so what might mr brown do ?
on the economy the prime minister is expected to look at more short term help to support those suffering most from the economic downturn .
that will need cash , which he does not have , so long term investment budgets in the public services might be plundered while he waits for the economy to improve .
virtuous circle as for the man himself ?
he is clearly not going to go voluntarily , a putsch is unlikely and all attempts at another makeover look implausible .
but the aim somehow would be to restore mr brown 's reputation as a safe , competent , prudent ex-chancellor who can steer us through the slowdown .
as for the tories , does their victory show they are on course to win the next general election ?
no .
by-election results are notoriously poor predictors of national poll outcomes .
but by-elections , particularly historically important ones like this , can have a huge impact .
the result will boost conservative party morale .
it will encourage financial donors , but above all it will make the tories appear more clearly in the minds of voters as a potential future government .
in other words there is a virtuous circle here of success breeding success .

but in-fighting and a lack of transparency have generated regular rumours of power struggles at the top .
than shwe senior general than shwe , 73 , is the head of the ruling junta and controls the army .
he is the most hard-line leader , strongly opposed to allowing any political role for opposition leader aung san suu kyi .
after working in the burmese postal service , than shwe joined the army at the age of 20 and his career included a stint in the department of psychological warfare .
he has acted as burma 's head of state since 1992 , and was initially seen as more open than his predecessor , general saw maung .
some political prisoners were released , and human rights groups were allowed to visit burma .
but he continues to suppress all dissent , and oversaw the re-arrest of aung san suu kyi in 2003 .
rumours of his poor health are common , and were fuelled in january 2007 when he was admitted to a hospital in singapore for two weeks - missing an independence day dinner for military leaders and officials .
but reports that he may be suffering from intestinal cancer have not been substantiated .
not normally seen in public , a rare glimpse of his lavish lifestyle came in november 2006 when a video of his daughter 's wedding appeared on the internet .
it showed the bride draped in jewels , pouring out large quantities of champagne beside an ornate , golden bridal bed .
the footage sparked outrage from burmese watchers .
than shwe is said to be superstitious and regularly seeks the advice of astrologers .
maung aye maung aye is also a career soldier and the second most powerful man in the country .
he is believed to have established strong ties with burma 's many drug lords in the golden triangle while operating as a colonel in the late 1970s and 80s , before he joined the military leadership in 1993 .
he has a reputation for ruthlessness and xenophobia , and is also staunchly opposed to allowing aung san suu kyi any future role .

however , it has yet to receive the cash and as a result asked the london stock exchange to suspend its shares .
despite the problems , silverjet said it would continue services as scheduled .
urgent matter the uk airline , which flies from london 's luton airport to new york and dubai , is having to deal with high fuel prices and tight credit conditions .
a number of other airlines have also had problems , prompting many of them to raise fuel surcharges and start charging for services such as checking in bags .
airlines only offering business class services have been hit particularly hard , with eos and maxjet already having ceased operations .
" silverjet 's working capital reserves are limited and advances under the loan facility are required as a matter of urgency , " the company said .
" in the circumstances , silverjet has requested , and the london stock exchange has confirmed , an immediate suspension in the trading of the ordinary shares of the company on the aim market , " it added .
" silverjet continues discussions with other parties , which have confirmed an interest in investing in the company .
silverjet started services in january 2007 and operates three aircraft .

hard-nosed kgb types are reliably cast as stock villains in mainstream fare , but the country 's piracy problems are perhaps more troubling to the businessmen of hollywood .
but russia 's own burgeoning film industry has been gaining confidence for several years , with breakouts like timur bekmambetov 's action adventure night watch achieving a modicum of success outside europe .
bekmambetov has already made the leap to los angeles , where he directed james mcavoy and angelina jolie in forthcoming blockbuster wanted .
meanwhile , budgets and ambition are on the rise in moscow .
director andrei borisov has come to the cannes film festival with an ambitious epic based on genghis khan , the mongol warrior who built a vast 13th century empire .
everybody on the set was pretending they were genghis , even the producer !
andrei borisov , director by the will of genghis khan took two years to complete , and recasts the warrior as a hero , rather than the feared killer he is often perceived to be in western narratives .
but , with production costs reaching $ 10m -lrb- £ 5m -rrb- - nearly five times the average budget for russian movies - the film will need to find an audience outside its home territory , hence its presence at the world 's most prestigious film festival .
borisov hopes that the film 's grand scale and international cast will attract foreign audiences .
" our actors are from germany , the us , mongolia , russia , " he says , admitting " it was really difficult to put them all together " .
the cast includes us actor cary-hiroyuki tagawa , who has appeared in the likes of heroes and memoirs of a geisha , and orgil makhaan , who played genghis khan in the bbc 's critically acclaimed 2005 documentary about the warrior .
the real-life mongolian army acted in the battle scenes this time round , he plays khan 's best friend - although he had been keen to try for the lead role .
" did he audition for the main part ?
yes , of course ! " says borisov .
" thirteen people who played genghis khan in different projects took part in this film , so everybody on the set was pretending they were genghis , even the producer ! "
for authenticity , the film was shot in the very places where khan walked 700 years ago , including the gobi desert and the ice-covered kihlyakh mountains in yakutia .
the modern-day mongolian army also took part in the film 's massive battle scenes .
with no cgi , and up to 500 men on horseback in any one shot , the army pulled off stunts that the professionals from japan and the us did not dare to try .
battle scenes " the professionals we brought over needed a lot of equipment for their stunts , but the mongolian army could do it without , " says producer vladimir ivanov .
" these local nomads said : ' oh , it 's so difficult for you , and it takes so long for you to put all this equipment here to perform these tricks , let us show you . '
" so they showed them all these very difficult manoeuvres with the horses and so on , and the japanese and american professionals said : ' oh no , we refuse , we do n't know how to do this . " '
despite the majestic sweep of the film 's locations and the intense battle scenes , the film may prove to be a difficult sell outside russia - not least because its dialogue is a mixture of nine turkic languages .
but its presence in cannes is a convincing sign that russian film-makers are ready to take their place on the world stage .

with no cgi , and up to 500 men on horseback in any one shot , the army pulled off stunts that the professionals from japan and the us did not dare to try .
battle scenes " the professionals we brought over needed a lot of equipment for their stunts , but the mongolian army could do it without , " says producer vladimir ivanov .
" these local nomads said : ' oh , it 's so difficult for you , and it takes so long for you to put all this equipment here to perform these tricks , let us show you . '
" so they showed them all these very difficult manoeuvres with the horses and so on , and the japanese and american professionals said : ' oh no , we refuse , we do n't know how to do this . " '
despite the majestic sweep of the film 's locations and the intense battle scenes , the film may prove to be a difficult sell outside russia - not least because its dialogue is a mixture of nine turkic languages .
but its presence in cannes is a convincing sign that russian film-makers are ready to take their place on the world stage .

hard-nosed kgb types are reliably cast as stock villains in mainstream fare , but the country 's piracy problems are perhaps more troubling to the businessmen of hollywood .
but russia 's own burgeoning film industry has been gaining confidence for several years , with breakouts like timur bekmambetov 's action adventure night watch achieving a modicum of success outside europe .
bekmambetov has already made the leap to los angeles , where he directed james mcavoy and angelina jolie in forthcoming blockbuster wanted .
meanwhile , budgets and ambition are on the rise in moscow .
director andrei borisov has come to the cannes film festival with an ambitious epic based on genghis khan , the mongol warrior who built a vast 13th century empire .
everybody on the set was pretending they were genghis , even the producer !
andrei borisov , director by the will of genghis khan took two years to complete , and recasts the warrior as a hero , rather than the feared killer he is often perceived to be in western narratives .
but , with production costs reaching $ 10m -lrb- £ 5m -rrb- - nearly five times the average budget for russian movies - the film will need to find an audience outside its home territory , hence its presence at the world 's most prestigious film festival .
borisov hopes that the film 's grand scale and international cast will attract foreign audiences .
" our actors are from germany , the us , mongolia , russia , " he says , admitting " it was really difficult to put them all together " .
the cast includes us actor cary-hiroyuki tagawa , who has appeared in the likes of heroes and memoirs of a geisha , and orgil makhaan , who played genghis khan in the bbc 's critically acclaimed 2005 documentary about the warrior .
the real-life mongolian army acted in the battle scenes this time round , he plays khan 's best friend - although he had been keen to try for the lead role .
" did he audition for the main part ?
yes , of course ! " says borisov .
" thirteen people who played genghis khan in different projects took part in this film , so everybody on the set was pretending they were genghis , even the producer ! "

the international passenger survey , designed to provide data for tourism , now plays a central role in migration estimates , the committee of mps said .
they said it was " not fit for this purpose " and methods of measuring movement in the uk " unsatisfactory " .
the committee said new surveys were needed .
the lib dems said ministers had " totally lost track " of the population .
in its counting the population report , the commons treasury committee accepted that the uk was in a period of " significant population change " which made it harder to estimate numbers of people in each area .
' social responsibility ' but it said population estimates were " central to every national system of official statistics " , used to estimate funding for local government , the nhs and other public services .
getting them right was therefore " a matter of social responsibility " the report said .
maps of migration across uk it concluded that the ips - a survey of a random sample of passengers entering and leaving the uk designed largely to provide tourism and business travel data - was now being " called upon to play a central role in estimating international migration " .
" it is clear from the evidence we have received that the survey is not fit for this new purpose , " the committee said .
the committee said the office for national statistics -lrb- ons -rrb- had estimated there to have been only 43,000 short-term migrants in england and wales between june 2004 and june 2005 - based on the ips .
' small sample ' but it said , to many that figure was " implausibly low " particularly as , in the year 2005-6 , in greater london alone there were 235,640 new national insurance number registrations .
it said ips statistics for 2005 on international migration were based on " a very small sample " of interviews - with 2,965 people entering the uk and 781 who left . "
it is now impossible to estimate accurately the uk population today " michael fallon sub-committee chairman it recommended that the ips be replaced with a new , more comprehensive survey designed to measure international movements .
the report also said methods used to measure populations between each census were also " not fit for purpose " as they mid-year estimates did not include short-term migrants .
it recommended that the new statistics authority establish " as an immediate priority " more accurate local population statistics reflecting the effects of internal migration .
' painfully clear ' it called for the authority to look into using other data sources to measure population figures - such as the national insurance number register , gp lists and council tax records .
the 2011 census should be the last where population is counted through the collection of census forms , it said - instead data should be gathered throughout the uk to allow more reliable annual statistics .
sub-committee chairman , the conservative mp michael fallon , said they heard evidence that councils including westminster , slough and manchester had been given reduced funding , because of " inaccurate statistical data " . "
ministers have totally lost track of something as fundamental as how many people actually live in britain " chris huhne lib dem home affairs spokesman " it is now impossible to estimate accurately the uk population today .
unreliable statistics make planning impossible .
we call on the government to improve the population count as a matter of urgency . "
he told bbc radio 5 live the uk was lagging behind other countries when it came to measuring population .
" other countries have much more modern ways of doing this .
they have proper population registers , they have address registers and they know where the population was at the end of last week .
" we seem to have really lost track of our population and nobody really has any faith that the government really knows how many people are here and how many are n't . "
' dynamism ' jill matheson , the director general for statistics delivery at the office for national statistics , said some of the trends in the uk 's workforce mean that producing accurate figures is a difficult task .
" traditionally what the population estimates have done is measured usual residents .
what we 've seen more recently is a lot more very short-term migration and a lot of short-term movement between different parts of the country as well .
of course we have no register , nobody 's required to tell anybody if they 're moving , if they 're leaving , if they 're going to live somewhere else , either for a short period or indefinitely , and that 's the challenge . "
professor john salt , of university college london , an international migration expert , said it was " very difficult " to produce a system that captures the " dynamism " of people leaving and entering the uk .
for the lib dems , chris huhne said : " this report makes it painfully clear that ministers have totally lost track of something as fundamental as how many people actually live in britain . "

they said it was " not fit for this purpose " and methods of measuring movement in the uk " unsatisfactory " .
the committee said new surveys were needed .
the lib dems said ministers had " totally lost track " of the population .
in its counting the population report , the commons treasury committee accepted that the uk was in a period of " significant population change " which made it harder to estimate numbers of people in each area .
' social responsibility ' but it said population estimates were " central to every national system of official statistics " , used to estimate funding for local government , the nhs and other public services .

maps of migration across uk it concluded that the ips - a survey of a random sample of passengers entering and leaving the uk designed largely to provide tourism and business travel data - was now being " called upon to play a central role in estimating international migration " .
" it is clear from the evidence we have received that the survey is not fit for this new purpose , " the committee said .
the committee said the office for national statistics -lrb- ons -rrb- had estimated there to have been only 43,000 short-term migrants in england and wales between june 2004 and june 2005 - based on the ips .
' small sample ' but it said , to many that figure was " implausibly low " particularly as , in the year 2005-6 , in greater london alone there were 235,640 new national insurance number registrations .
it said ips statistics for 2005 on international migration were based on " a very small sample " of interviews - with 2,965 people entering the uk and 781 who left .
it is now impossible to estimate accurately the uk population today michael fallon sub-committee chairman it recommended that the ips be replaced with a new , more comprehensive survey designed to measure international movements .
the report also said methods used to measure populations between each census were also " not fit for purpose " as they mid-year estimates did not include short-term migrants .
it recommended that the new statistics authority establish " as an immediate priority " more accurate local population statistics reflecting the effects of internal migration .
' painfully clear ' it called for the authority to look into using other data sources to measure population figures - such as the national insurance number register , gp lists and council tax records .
the 2011 census should be the last where population is counted through the collection of census forms , it said - instead data should be gathered throughout the uk to allow more reliable annual statistics .

the international passenger survey , designed to provide data for tourism , now plays a central role in migration estimates , the committee of mps said .
they said it was " not fit for this purpose " and methods of measuring movement in the uk " unsatisfactory " .
the committee said new surveys were needed .
the lib dems said ministers had " totally lost track " of the population .
in its counting the population report , the commons treasury committee accepted that the uk was in a period of " significant population change " which made it harder to estimate numbers of people in each area .
' social responsibility ' but it said population estimates were " central to every national system of official statistics " , used to estimate funding for local government , the nhs and other public services .
getting them right was therefore " a matter of social responsibility " the report said .
maps of migration across uk it concluded that the ips - a survey of a random sample of passengers entering and leaving the uk designed largely to provide tourism and business travel data - was now being " called upon to play a central role in estimating international migration " .
" it is clear from the evidence we have received that the survey is not fit for this new purpose , " the committee said .
the committee said the office for national statistics -lrb- ons -rrb- had estimated there to have been only 43,000 short-term migrants in england and wales between june 2004 and june 2005 - based on the ips .
' small sample ' but it said , to many that figure was " implausibly low " particularly as , in the year 2005-6 , in greater london alone there were 235,640 new national insurance number registrations .
it said ips statistics for 2005 on international migration were based on " a very small sample " of interviews - with 2,965 people entering the uk and 781 who left .
it is now impossible to estimate accurately the uk population today michael fallon sub-committee chairman it recommended that the ips be replaced with a new , more comprehensive survey designed to measure international movements .
the report also said methods used to measure populations between each census were also " not fit for purpose " as they mid-year estimates did not include short-term migrants .
it recommended that the new statistics authority establish " as an immediate priority " more accurate local population statistics reflecting the effects of internal migration .
' painfully clear ' it called for the authority to look into using other data sources to measure population figures - such as the national insurance number register , gp lists and council tax records .
the 2011 census should be the last where population is counted through the collection of census forms , it said - instead data should be gathered throughout the uk to allow more reliable annual statistics .
sub-committee chairman , the conservative mp michael fallon , said they heard evidence that councils including westminster , slough and manchester had been given reduced funding , because of " inaccurate statistical data " .
ministers have totally lost track of something as fundamental as how many people actually live in britain chris huhne lib dem home affairs spokesman " it is now impossible to estimate accurately the uk population today .
unreliable statistics make planning impossible .
we call on the government to improve the population count as a matter of urgency . "
he told bbc radio 5 live the uk was lagging behind other countries when it came to measuring population .
" other countries have much more modern ways of doing this .
they have proper population registers , they have address registers and they know where the population was at the end of last week .
" we seem to have really lost track of our population and nobody really has any faith that the government really knows how many people are here and how many are n't . "
' dynamism ' jill matheson , the director general for statistics delivery at the office for national statistics , said some of the trends in the uk 's workforce mean that producing accurate figures is a difficult task .
" traditionally what the population estimates have done is measured usual residents .
what we 've seen more recently is a lot more very short-term migration and a lot of short-term movement between different parts of the country as well .
of course we have no register , nobody 's required to tell anybody if they 're moving , if they 're leaving , if they 're going to live somewhere else , either for a short period or indefinitely , and that 's the challenge . "
professor john salt , of university college london , an international migration expert , said it was " very difficult " to produce a system that captures the " dynamism " of people leaving and entering the uk .
for the lib dems , chris huhne said : " this report makes it painfully clear that ministers have totally lost track of something as fundamental as how many people actually live in britain . "

in the middle of the colourful acts , crazy dancing and controversial voting are the hosts who , year after year , are charged with keeping smooth control of the whole event .
until the mid-1990s , presenting eurovision was the preserve of the solo female host , when the ubiquitous double act - a man and a woman - took over .
this year 's show in belgrade , serbia is the turn of tv presenter jovana jankovic and pop star zeljko joksimovic to play the happy couple .
for jankovic , serbia 's equivalent of gmtv 's fiona phillips , live television is not daunting as she fronts the country 's daily breakfast show .
" i 'm honoured to be the host and i 'm really looking forward to the event , " she says .
successful musicians the pair have been rehearsing for weeks and will continue to do so throughout the week of the contest .
in the run-up to eurovision week , jankovic admitted of the task ahead : " everything looks very confusing . "
" but i think we are working on everything , and as long as we 're getting better everything will be good . "
the pair have also been having english and french classes , as well as choreography classes .
the language tuition will help the pair negotiate their way through the long voting process , where the results have to be announced in both tongues .
joksimovic , 35 , is one of the most successful musicians in the balkans and has been involved with eurovision for many years .
in 2004 he represented serbia and montenegro in istanbul , finishing second with lane moje .
two years later his song lejla finished third for bosnia 's hari mata hari .
and this year he composed serbia 's entry , which is being performed by jelena tomasevic for the host country .
when asked why both she and joksimovic were asked to host the show , jankovic reels off a long list of must-haves .
" they told me before i was chosen that you needed to be good in your profession , to have charm and to know languages .
' chemistry ' " they told me that but they always have one host who works regularly on television and who is very familiar with presenting shows and the other one who is a star in the host country .
" the most important thing is to be very charming and to have a good connection with people . "
despite his successful singing career joksimovic has very little presenting experience , but jankovic clearly does not that think that will hinder him .
" i think the chemistry between the two of us is very good at this moment , " she says .
" in march we did the second draw for the eurovision song contest and we were preparing for the draw for two weeks .
we had a great time together .
" after that we were meeting each other going for lunches .
for the hosts it is most important that they know each other well , " she adds .
despite all the rehearsals and hosting experience , anyone who works in or watches television will say it can all go wrong on the night .
asked if this worries her , jankovic explains : " well i hope that nothing will go wrong this time because we have 10 days of rehearsals .
" if something does though , we will see what happens and how we will react , i suppose . "
the second semi-final of the eurovision song contest takes place on thursday night and will be shown on bbc three from 2000 bst .
the grand final is on saturday 24 may and will be on bbc one from 2000 bst .

' chemistry ' " they told me that but they always have one host who works regularly on television and who is very familiar with presenting shows and the other one who is a star in the host country .

joksimovic represented serbia in 2004 and came second despite his successful singing career joksimovic has very little presenting experience , but jankovic clearly does not that think that will hinder him .

this year 's show in belgrade , serbia is the turn of tv presenter jovana jankovic and pop star zeljko joksimovic to play the happy couple .

in the middle of the colourful acts , crazy dancing and controversial voting are the hosts who , year after year , are charged with keeping smooth control of the whole event .
until the mid-1990s , presenting eurovision was the preserve of the solo female host , when the ubiquitous double act - a man and a woman - took over .
this year 's show in belgrade , serbia is the turn of tv presenter jovana jankovic and pop star zeljko joksimovic to play the happy couple .
for jankovic , serbia 's equivalent of gmtv 's fiona phillips , live television is not daunting as she fronts the country 's daily breakfast show .
" i 'm honoured to be the host and i 'm really looking forward to the event , " she says .
successful musicians the pair have been rehearsing for weeks and will continue to do so throughout the week of the contest .
in the run-up to eurovision week , jankovic admitted of the task ahead : " everything looks very confusing . "
" but i think we are working on everything , and as long as we 're getting better everything will be good . "
the pair have also been having english and french classes , as well as choreography classes .
the language tuition will help the pair negotiate their way through the long voting process , where the results have to be announced in both tongues .
joksimovic , 35 , is one of the most successful musicians in the balkans and has been involved with eurovision for many years .
zeljko joksimovic wrote serbia 's entry this year for jelena tomasevic in 2004 he represented serbia and montenegro in istanbul , finishing second with lane moje .
two years later his song lejla finished third for bosnia 's hari mata hari .
and this year he composed serbia 's entry , which is being performed by jelena tomasevic for the host country .
when asked why both she and joksimovic were asked to host the show , jankovic reels off a long list of must-haves .
" they told me before i was chosen that you needed to be good in your profession , to have charm and to know languages .
' chemistry ' " they told me that but they always have one host who works regularly on television and who is very familiar with presenting shows and the other one who is a star in the host country .
" the most important thing is to be very charming and to have a good connection with people . "
joksimovic represented serbia in 2004 and came second despite his successful singing career joksimovic has very little presenting experience , but jankovic clearly does not that think that will hinder him .
" i think the chemistry between the two of us is very good at this moment , " she says .
" in march we did the second draw for the eurovision song contest and we were preparing for the draw for two weeks .
we had a great time together .
" after that we were meeting each other going for lunches .
for the hosts it is most important that they know each other well , " she adds .
despite all the rehearsals and hosting experience , anyone who works in or watches television will say it can all go wrong on the night .
asked if this worries her , jankovic explains : " well i hope that nothing will go wrong this time because we have 10 days of rehearsals .
" if something does though , we will see what happens and how we will react , i suppose . "
the second semi-final of the eurovision song contest takes place on thursday night and will be shown on bbc three from 2000 bst .
the grand final is on saturday 24 may and will be on bbc one from 2000 bst .

its annual good beach guide also said beaches failing the minimum legal standard had more than doubled to 18 .
the mcs blamed the drop in water quality on an increase in storm pollution .

" heavy rain sweeps pollutants like raw sewage , street debris and animal waste directly from the land into rivers and the sea . "

in may last year , the group warned that storm run-off from city streets , farm land and combined sewer overflows was hampering efforts by scottish water and the scottish environment protection agency -lrb- sepa -rrb- to improve bathing water quality .
the guide recommended 44 beaches this year - more than triple the total in 1998 .

the society said electronic forecasting signs advising swimmers about beach water quality had been a great success and it would like to see more of them .
mr duncan added : " we also now need serious investment to tackle pollution from the hundreds of storm overflows around the coast and the more than two dozen outfalls continuously pumping poorly treated sewage into the sea .
" mcs is very supportive of the strategy and action plans adopted by sepa and the scottish government to tackle coastal pollution but we equally have concerns that sepa has reduced bathing water testing by more than 30 % since 2003 . "
mcs only recommends beaches if they are better than the guideline european water quality standard and are not affected by inadequately treated continuous sewage discharge .

it sounds like something out of a nursery rhyme , slightly ridiculous ; surely not a virus that could land me in hospital , wired up to a saline drip , oxygen mask clamped to my face ?
sadly , yes .
measles is no joke , nor is it as uncommon as it used to be , thanks to the mmr / autism scare -lrb- debunked but still having an impact -rrb- .
measles is caused by a virus spread by droplets i 'll never know how i contracted it .
possibly i came too close on the tube to a traveller from one of the current european outbreaks , in poland and southern germany .
according to a note sent to my workplace by the communicable disease control unit , i should not have got it in the first place .
" if you were born before 1970 , you are likely to be already immune to measles , " the advice said .
there was no vaccine in hong kong in the 1960s , where i grew up , but outbreaks regularly swept the community , and my mother even sent me to spend the day with some friends who had caught it , to spare me getting a childhood disease in adulthood .
how i wish her tactic had worked .
slow start my illness started about a month ago with a slight feeling of nausea , and a mild , intermittent fever .
over a weekend i developed a deep , convulsive , painful cough , and a burning sore throat .
measles a highly infectious viral illness causes a range of symptoms including fever , coughing , and distinctive red-brown spots complications can include pneumonia , ear and eye infections , and croup -lrb- an infection of the lungs and throat -rrb- more serious complications , such as inflammation of the brain -lrb- encephalitis -rrb- , are rarer but can be fatal health - measles my fever rose , and i was too unwell to go to work when monday dawned .
my gp diagnosed a chest infection and gave me antibiotics .
even with four-hourly paracetamol , i struggled to keep my temperature under 39c , and as for eating , forget it .
the next day i came out in a rash and went back to the doctor .
he and a colleague toyed with a measles diagnosis , but decided it was probably an allergic reaction to the antibiotic , after establishing that i had had an adverse reaction to it before .
but i got no better even with a different antibiotic , and taking anti-histamine tablets .
a day later , still with a high fever and no longer able to keep fluid down , my doctor told me to go to a & e. hospital care there was continuing confusion over my diagnosis , though the specialists at the infectious diseases department were pretty sure it was measles .
i had all the expected symptoms , which also included sore mouth , painful eyes , aching muscles and diarrhoea .
i felt as bad as i looked then phil rice , a consultant virologist at st george 's hospital in south london , asked me the key question : " how do you really feel ? "
" absolutely dreadful , the sickest i 've ever felt , " i croaked .
" that 's the final arbiter , " he said .
the saliva test proved positive for the virus the next day .
i spent two days in hospital , in an isolation room .
once they 'd got my fluid levels back to normal , i was safe to go home .
the doctors made no secret of the fact that in hospital i was at risk of getting further infections , as measles suppresses one 's immune system , and was a potential danger to other patients and staff - one of the nurses was clearly nervous about coming into my room to do the regular observations .
slow recovery so it was back to home and nursing by my long-suffering wife .
recovery has been surprisingly slow , though i avoided the really nasty complications , such as pneumonia and encephalitis .
in a weakened state , i picked up an eye infection , and had another allergic reaction to who knows what .
four weeks on from the onset , i 'm back at work , but suffer from fatigue and a racing pulse .
measles is astonishingly infectious .
two unvaccinated friends of my young sons picked it up from me before i was diagnosed .
they had only very briefly been in my house , and never came within four metres of me .
we 're hoping the trail of infection has stopped with them .
rising threat a number of local parents have taken note and had their children vaccinated .
but doctors in south london , where i live , fear bigger outbreaks among unvaccinated children .
inoculation rates here are less than 70 % , considerably less than the national average .
health officials cast envious eyes across the north sea , where scandinavian countries have seen off the virus for some 10 years .
there were 769 confirmed cases in england and wales in the first 10 months of 2007 and school outbreaks this year in cornwall and south-east london reveal continuing problems with the take-up of the vaccination .
" i suspect they will need to do a new nationwide campaign to head off epidemics of both measles and rubella , " said dr rice .
