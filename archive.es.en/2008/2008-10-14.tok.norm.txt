germany 's economy ministry will unveil its own growth estimates on thursday , which are also expected to be revised sharply lower .
investor confidence plunges these growth rates make up the economists ' " basic scenario . "

ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .
i have n't been able to find one .
in all my years at fc bayern munich , in my entire soccer career , i ca n't remember having such a bad start in the season .
so many people are preoccupied with finding an explanation for this -lrb- pile of successive defeats -rrb- .
my take on it is that the situation is so complex that no explanation is necessary .
we must simply work harder to reach our goal : to be at the top of the league .
what are you thinking when you look at the scoreboard and fc bayern munich is in llth place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .
this season the team has shown in a rudimentary way that it understands klinsmann 's working philosophy - in playing against cologne , against nuremburg or in the second half of the champions league playoffs against lyon .
what we 're missing is consistency and a good balance .
but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?
bildunterschrift : " now is not the time to whine and look for explanations .
the season begins anew ... "
we do n't have much time .
hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- is in the lead by seven points .
the experimental phase is over .
i 'm not the only one who knows that .
our coach knows that too .
now is not the time to keep whining or look for explanations .
we need to get our act together for upcoming games .
the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .
second , even if i had talked to fc bayern or another club about commitments starting 2009 , i would give them all the same answer : this is not the right time to discuss such matters .
i 'm only going to start thinking about my future starting in february or march of next year .
at the moment , i 'm fully focused on the current season .
third of all , a final decision of where to go or stay would be made in conjunction with my whole family .
regardless of what the future holds , my wife , my kids and i feel very much at home in munich .
fans of fc bayern munich would perhaps want to see more of you , the ze roberto , who grows better with age .
meanwhile i almost believe in my old motto .
i recently said that i 'm like a good old bottle of wine : with age , i always get better .
that seems to be the case right now . daniel martinez -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?

the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .
second , even if i had talked to fc bayern or another club about commitments starting 2009 , i would give them all the same answer : this is not the right time to discuss such matters .
i 'm only going to start thinking about my future starting in february or march of next year .
at the moment , i 'm fully focused on the current season .
third of all , a final decision of where to go or stay would be made in conjunction with my whole family .
regardless of what the future holds , my wife , my kids and i feel very much at home in munich .
fans of fc bayern munich would perhaps want to see more of you , the ze roberto , who grows better with age .
meanwhile i almost believe in my old motto .

ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .
i have n't been able to find one .
in all my years at fc bayern munich , in my entire soccer career , i ca n't remember having such a bad start in the season .
so many people are preoccupied with finding an explanation for this -lrb- pile of successive defeats -rrb- .
my take on it is that the situation is so complex that no explanation is necessary .
we must simply work harder to reach our goal : to be at the top of the league .
what are you thinking when you look at the scoreboard and fc bayern munich is in llth place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .
this season the team has shown in a rudimentary way that it understands klinsmann 's working philosophy - in playing against cologne , against nuremburg or in the second half of the champions league playoffs against lyon .
what we 're missing is consistency and a good balance .
but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .

but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?

we do n't have much time .
hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- is in the lead by seven points .
the experimental phase is over .
i 'm not the only one who knows that .
our coach knows that too .
now is not the time to keep whining or look for explanations .
we need to get our act together for upcoming games .
the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .
second , even if i had talked to fc bayern or another club about commitments starting 2009 , i would give them all the same answer : this is not the right time to discuss such matters .
i 'm only going to start thinking about my future starting in february or march of next year .
at the moment , i 'm fully focused on the current season .
third of all , a final decision of where to go or stay would be made in conjunction with my whole family .
regardless of what the future holds , my wife , my kids and i feel very much at home in munich .
fans of fc bayern munich would perhaps want to see more of you , the ze roberto , who grows better with age .
meanwhile i almost believe in my old motto .
i recently said that i 'm like a good old bottle of wine : with age , i always get better .

ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .
i have n't been able to find one .
in all my years at fc bayern munich , in my entire soccer career , i ca n't remember having such a bad start in the season .
so many people are preoccupied with finding an explanation for this -lrb- pile of successive defeats -rrb- .
my take on it is that the situation is so complex that no explanation is necessary .
we must simply work harder to reach our goal : to be at the top of the league .
what are you thinking when you look at the scoreboard and fc bayern munich is in llth place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .
this season the team has shown in a rudimentary way that it understands klinsmann 's working philosophy - in playing against cologne , against nuremburg or in the second half of the champions league playoffs against lyon .
what we 're missing is consistency and a good balance .
but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .

a german photographer and an artist won lawsuits against google for displaying thumbnails of their works in search results without permission .
google will reportedly appeal the ruling . google can not display copyrighted works as thumbnails without an owner 's permission , a court in the northern german city of hamburg ruled on tuesday , oct 14 .
since the photos in google image search are displayed as thumbnails , no new work is created , which leaves no justification for displaying the copywrited works without permission , the court ruled .
" it does n't matter that thumbnails are much smaller than original pictures and are displayed in a lower resolution , " the court said in its ruling .
artists complain google 's image search function brings up often millions of thumbnails of photographs , pictures and other graphics culled from internet sites .
google always has a disclaimed next to images that they might be scaled down and also might be subject to copyright .
but for some that is not enough .
they do not want their images to show up in the search engine at all .
german photographer michael bernhard and artist thomas horn brought cases against google in germany to protest the display of their copyrighted images .
horn , whose comic drawings were displayed on google , has reportedly asked for about 1,300 euros plus interest to compensate for his " stolen pictures . "
google likely to appeal if the ruling ends up keeping all copyrighted images from being displayed in google , that " capitulates us into the digital stone age , " kay oberbeck , spokeswoman for google germany was quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper as saying .
google will appeal the ruling , the newspaper reported .
but if it is upheld , it could mean that google would have to turn off its image search function , the hamburger abendblatt reported .

a german photographer and an artist won lawsuits against google for displaying thumbnails of their works in search results without permission .
google will reportedly appeal the ruling . google can not display copyrighted works as thumbnails without an owner 's permission , a court in the northern german city of hamburg ruled on tuesday , oct 14 .
since the photos in google image search are displayed as thumbnails , no new work is created , which leaves no justification for displaying the copywrited works without permission , the court ruled .
" it does n't matter that thumbnails are much smaller than original pictures and are displayed in a lower resolution , " the court said in its ruling .
artists complain google 's image search function brings up often millions of thumbnails of photographs , pictures and other graphics culled from internet sites .
google always has a disclaimed next to images that they might be scaled down and also might be subject to copyright .
but for some that is not enough .

russian negotiators said they would not show up unless the two regions , which russia has recognized as independent nations , had a seat at the table for the talks scheduled for wednesday in the swiss capital .
" without them , we wo n't go to geneva , " deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said in a statement .
but before boarding a plane to geneva , the head of the georgian delegation said : " the georgian side will not allow it .
" representatives from abkhazia and the so-called south ossetia will not take part in negotiations in geneva , " deputy foreign minister grigol vashadze was quoted by news agency interfax as saying .
moscow flew in the face of western criticism and recognized the two regions as independent after routing a georgian offensive to take back control over south ossetia in august .
both have been self- governed since breaking from tbilisi 's rule in the early 1990s .
the disagreement means high-level negotiations to smooth out an eu- brokered ceasefire have devolved into " technical meetings " at the expert level , as a un spokesman put it .

georgian media cited the osce as saying that representatives of south ossetia and abkhazia were attending without giving further details .
russian news wires reported that these representatives could be folded into the russian delegation .
vashadze said georgia 's agenda was clear : " the full withdrawal of russian occupiers from georgia , the return of all refugees and the restoration of georgia 's integrity to its internationally recognized borders . "

ahead of the summit , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that europe and the rest of the world must rethink financial regulation and supervisory rules , including for hedge funds and private equity , once the crisis subsides .
he said he was encouraged by stock market surges following sunday 's adoption of a coordinated 2.2 trillion euro -lrb- $ 3,023 billion -rrb- rescue plan for banks in eurozone countries .
" once we have put financial markets back on their feet , we must ensure that in the future , they function properly for the benefit of citizens and businesses , rather than themselves , " barroso said .
german news agency dpa has reported that diplomats expect the eu summit to throw its weight behind the euro-group decision rather than proposing new measures .
mending ties with russia the second crisis on the eu 's agenda ?
whether or not it should re-open talks with russia on a key strategic partnership which were frozen in the wake of the summer 's russian-georgian war .
at an emergency summit on sept .
1 , leaders agreed there would be no further talks " until troops have withdrawn to the positions held prior to aug .
7 , " the day that fighting began .
russia withdrew from " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia on oct .
9 , but has more than doubled its troop presence in the regions , occupying formerly georgian-held positions there .
this has left eu states at odds over whether conditions for restarting the talks have been fulfilled .
" for me , it 's clear that we have to start the negotiations because the spirit of the agreement has been fulfilled , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
but swedish foreign minister carl bildt disagreed .
" if you look at the maps , -lrb- the russians -rrb- are not back to the positions they held prior to aug .
7 , " he said .
ireland to report on lisbon treaty finally , the summit is set to hear a report from the irish government on the country 's rejection of the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 .
the " no " vote threw the bloc into institutional panic as the treaty can not come into effect without being ratified by every member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit will give ireland another chance to express itself the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the eu 's institutions and increase efficiency and transparency to voters .
but in ireland , many voters reported feeling confused and poorly informed about the consequences of the referendum .
there were fears that voting " yes " to the treaty would lead to ireland 's arm being twisted on such sensitive issues as military neutrality and abortion rights .
ahead of the summit , european commission vice president margot wallstroem told the irish times that she has warned member states not to push ireland into a decision about whether to hold a second referendum .
" the irish should not be forced or pushed or pressed into taking a decision that they do n't feel ready for , " she said .
she added that rumors that eu politicians would move ahead without ireland were " unrealistic . "
" there might be those who will want to go ahead on their own , but i think it is totally unrealistic , " wallstroem said .
" nobody wants to see ireland out of the eu and that is certainly not the wish of the irish people . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ahead of the summit , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that europe and the rest of the world must rethink financial regulation and supervisory rules , including for hedge funds and private equity , once the crisis subsides .
he said he was encouraged by stock market surges following sunday 's adoption of a coordinated 2.2 trillion euro -lrb- $ 3,023 billion -rrb- rescue plan for banks in eurozone countries .
" once we have put financial markets back on their feet , we must ensure that in the future , they function properly for the benefit of citizens and businesses , rather than themselves , " barroso said .
german news agency dpa has reported that diplomats expect the eu summit to throw its weight behind the euro-group decision rather than proposing new measures .
mending ties with russia the second crisis on the eu 's agenda ?
whether or not it should re-open talks with russia on a key strategic partnership which were frozen in the wake of the summer 's russian-georgian war .
at an emergency summit on sept .
1 , leaders agreed there would be no further talks " until troops have withdrawn to the positions held prior to aug .
7 , " the day that fighting began .
russia withdrew from " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia on oct .
9 , but has more than doubled its troop presence in the regions , occupying formerly georgian-held positions there .
this has left eu states at odds over whether conditions for restarting the talks have been fulfilled .
" for me , it 's clear that we have to start the negotiations because the spirit of the agreement has been fulfilled , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
but swedish foreign minister carl bildt disagreed .
" if you look at the maps , -lrb- the russians -rrb- are not back to the positions they held prior to aug .
7 , " he said .
ireland to report on lisbon treaty finally , the summit is set to hear a report from the irish government on the country 's rejection of the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 .
the " no " vote threw the bloc into institutional panic as the treaty can not come into effect without being ratified by every member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit will give ireland another chance to express itself the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the eu 's institutions and increase efficiency and transparency to voters .
but in ireland , many voters reported feeling confused and poorly informed about the consequences of the referendum .
there were fears that voting " yes " to the treaty would lead to ireland 's arm being twisted on such sensitive issues as military neutrality and abortion rights .
ahead of the summit , european commission vice president margot wallstroem told the irish times that she has warned member states not to push ireland into a decision about whether to hold a second referendum .
" the irish should not be forced or pushed or pressed into taking a decision that they do n't feel ready for , " she said .
she added that rumors that eu politicians would move ahead without ireland were " unrealistic . "
" there might be those who will want to go ahead on their own , but i think it is totally unrealistic , " wallstroem said .
" nobody wants to see ireland out of the eu and that is certainly not the wish of the irish people . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 14.10.2008 daimler to slash us jobs as vw bucks economic downturn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler production lines in the us and canada are being closed and moved to mexico german auto giant daimler will eliminate 3,500 north american jobs owing to the worsening economic slowdown .
vw , however , bucked the downward trend and set record highs for its shares on the stock market . following announcements by nissan , renault , and volvo in europe , and restructuring by general motors and ford , utility vehicles are also unveiling hits from slumping sales .
in the united states , the market deteriorated " in a way we have not anticipated , " daimler trucks boss andreas renschler told a telephone press conference .
he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .
" as the recession deepens , the heavy-truck market is hit harder , " german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer told reporters .
" the sector will see a recession as well . "
in addition , a daimler spokeswoman told reporters , the sector is subject to regular cycles , and the german group had already expected diminished demand late this year and early in 2009 .
" it is falling back more sharply now , " she noted however .
finally , new us regulations aimed at reducing pollution have also hurt sales , daimler said .
the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .
production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .
as the deadline for porsche 's takeover approaches , those banks must make sure they own the shares in question .
brokers have said banks probably waited until the last minute in a bet that vw shares would fall because of the financial crisis and might be scrambling now to cover their positions .
mystery surrounds investors another hypothesis is that speculative investment funds may have targeted vw shares with the practice of short selling , in which they borrow shares that are immediately sold in expectation of being able to repurchase them later at a cheaper price before they must be returned to the original owner .
if that were the case , funds could also be buying heavily to make sure they can return the vw stock without suffering even heavier losses .
" people must unwind short positions because they are losing money , " baader bank strategist robert halver told reporters .
but in the end , even market specialists say that " no one knows who is holding the positions , who the speculative funds might be , who is buying or selling for porsche , " in the words of bhf-bank analyst albrecht denninghoff .
" we do not know how many people are on board the ship .
" there is no transparency in the markets .
at that point , anything is possible . "
halver goes even further , saying that even funds caught short trying to profit from short selling would not fully explain vw 's soaring share price .
" it is just not possible , " he said .
" bafin should open an investigation , " halver added in reference to germany 's financial market regulator .

in addition , a daimler spokeswoman told reporters , the sector is subject to regular cycles , and the german group had already expected diminished demand late this year and early in 2009 .
" it is falling back more sharply now , " she noted however .
finally , new us regulations aimed at reducing pollution have also hurt sales , daimler said .
the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .
production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .
as the deadline for porsche 's takeover approaches , those banks must make sure they own the shares in question .
brokers have said banks probably waited until the last minute in a bet that vw shares would fall because of the financial crisis and might be scrambling now to cover their positions .
mystery surrounds investors another hypothesis is that speculative investment funds may have targeted vw shares with the practice of short selling , in which they borrow shares that are immediately sold in expectation of being able to repurchase them later at a cheaper price before they must be returned to the original owner .
if that were the case , funds could also be buying heavily to make sure they can return the vw stock without suffering even heavier losses .
" people must unwind short positions because they are losing money , " baader bank strategist robert halver told reporters .
but in the end , even market specialists say that " no one knows who is holding the positions , who the speculative funds might be , who is buying or selling for porsche , " in the words of bhf-bank analyst albrecht denninghoff .
" we do not know how many people are on board the ship .
" there is no transparency in the markets .
at that point , anything is possible . "
halver goes even further , saying that even funds caught short trying to profit from short selling would not fully explain vw 's soaring share price .
" it is just not possible , " he said .

vw , however , bucked the downward trend and set record highs for its shares on the stock market . following announcements by nissan , renault , and volvo in europe , and restructuring by general motors and ford , utility vehicles are also unveiling hits from slumping sales .
in the united states , the market deteriorated " in a way we have not anticipated , " daimler trucks boss andreas renschler told a telephone press conference .
he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .

finally , new us regulations aimed at reducing pollution have also hurt sales , daimler said .
the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .
production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .
as the deadline for porsche 's takeover approaches , those banks must make sure they own the shares in question .
brokers have said banks probably waited until the last minute in a bet that vw shares would fall because of the financial crisis and might be scrambling now to cover their positions .
mystery surrounds investors another hypothesis is that speculative investment funds may have targeted vw shares with the practice of short selling , in which they borrow shares that are immediately sold in expectation of being able to repurchase them later at a cheaper price before they must be returned to the original owner .
if that were the case , funds could also be buying heavily to make sure they can return the vw stock without suffering even heavier losses .
" people must unwind short positions because they are losing money , " baader bank strategist robert halver told reporters .
but in the end , even market specialists say that " no one knows who is holding the positions , who the speculative funds might be , who is buying or selling for porsche , " in the words of bhf-bank analyst albrecht denninghoff .
" we do not know how many people are on board the ship .
" there is no transparency in the markets .
at that point , anything is possible . "
halver goes even further , saying that even funds caught short trying to profit from short selling would not fully explain vw 's soaring share price .
" it is just not possible , " he said .
" bafin should open an investigation , " halver added in reference to germany 's financial market regulator .
a spokeswoman for the market watchdog told the afp news agency it is examining the data .
“ it is not a formal investigation , " she added . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

president of the european union hans-gert pottering , who also serves as president-in-office of empa , called for speedy solutions to two issues that hinder the peace negotiations : " the expansion of settlements , which is undermining the palestinians ' confidence " in the peace process , and " the extremely restricted freedom of movement of palestinians , " which has hindered investment in the palestinian economy and prevented economic recovery .
worries of fading interest given that empa countries provide 60 percent of all aid to the palestinians , pottering warned of the need to prevent donors being overcome by " a certain fatigue , or lack of interest in the fate of the palestinians . "
he said that it was " unacceptable that the fruits of financial solidarity should be wiped out as a result of military operations or for security reasons , however legitimate they may be . "

in the long term , it could mean more eu-wide regulation . recent days have seen european governments galloping to the rescue of struggling banks , approving mergers and announcing billion-euro bailouts .
in the process , they 've threatened to ride roughshod over the european union 's strict limits on state aid to the private sector .
that is the view of neelie kroes , the commissioner in charge of competition for the eu , who used the wild west analogy in a sharply-worded speech in brussels on monday , oct .
13 .
an anything-goes atmosphere would be a “ recipe for chaos , ” kroes warned .
yet it ’ s unlikely that europe ’ s financial crisis will turn into a spaghetti western .
in the long run , the banking crisis will likely mean more unity in europe ’ s financial sector , say leading economists and eu banking experts .
in crisis mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current crisis has been likened to the wild west the top priority for eu leaders in recent days has been to unfreeze the credit markets .
all other concerns have taken a back seat .
more than a half dozen european countries announced bailout plans monday , with germany alone putting together a rescue package worth as much as 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 671 billion -rrb- .
“ the agenda is dominated by crisis management .
everything is suspended until we 're out of the crisis , ” iain begg , an expert on eu policies and fiscal issues at the london school of economics , told deutsche welle .
yet after the immediate crisis stabilizes , europe will need to take a broader look at its banking sector .
improving competition and regulation were issues before the crisis and now have become even more so , begg and others said .
finding a solution even as european governments announced 1.4 trillion euros in guarantees and other emergency measures , they stopped short of a one-size-fits-all bailout .
specific actions were left up to individual countries and no europe-wide fund has been established to help other countries ' troubled banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are calls for large banks to be regulated differently still , that level of unity was remarkable for the euro area , said nicolas veron of bruegel , a european think tank devoted to international economics . “ what is sure is that the europeans have reacted quickly to the crisis and that was not a foregone conclusion , ” veron told deutsche welle .
european markets reacted positively , jumping 9 percent on monday.the hope is that government guarantees will help banks overcome their reluctance to lend money to one another .
opening up competition yet veron cautioned against the idea that the road ahead would be easy .
“ what was announced yesterday will not magically solve all the problems , ” veron said .
“ the implementation will be very difficult . ”
a few hours after offering up her wild west criticism , kroes made public rules for eu member states to follow when rescuing banks .
all banks which operate in a country have to be covered by guarantees , kroes said .
this is an implied criticism of ireland , which on sept .
30 proposed covering only deposits in irish-owned banks .
the government has since revised the proposal to include non-irish banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has promised 500 billion euros “ we 've had problems with competition in europe for a long time .
most european bank markets are heavily dominated by national firms , ” said fredrik erixon , the director of the european center for international political economy -lrb- ecipe -rrb- , a think tank dedicated to trade and other international issues of importance to europe . yet multinational banks pose their own set of problems , erixon and others point out .
who would pick up the bill for bailing out the british subsidiary , say , of spain 's banco santander ?
or who would come to the rescue of the spanish arm of deutsche bank ? and would it be enough to tighten regulations on european banks ?
erixon said the worry is that people would then shift investments to asia and the us where regulations did n't exist . economists just do n't know exactly what the upcoming days and months will bring . “ we are still in the phase of crisis reaction , ” erixon said .
it 's an ending that remains to be written . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , in a ceremony that precludes the frankfurt book fair , the world 's premier publishing event .
the german book prize recognizes novels with a broad international appeal .
there is a three-step selection process in which a panel of judges select 20 titles , six of which are then short-listed .
tellkamp 's nearly 1,000-page tome is about the disintegration of former east germany , leading to the collapse of the communist regime in 1989 .
the semi-autobiographical saga spans three generations of a of an elite group of dresden intellectuals and artists living in an ivory tower high above the baroque city that was once called the florence of the elbe and demolished by allied bombs at the end of the war .
the main protagonist , who is the son of a doctor and a nurse , rebels against the system as the novel traverses east german literary circles , political institutions , schools and clinics .
author jailed in communist east germany tellkamp , 39 , is a medical doctor who wrote " der turm " between hospital shifts .
he was born in dresden and jailed for his " political unreliability " just before the communist regime dissolved and germany was reunified .
afterwards , tellkamp embarked on his medical studies in newyork and the eastern german city of leipzig before working as a doctor in a dresden clinic .
bildunterschrift : the former eastern baroque city of dresden is the backdrop of an epic that spans three generations tellkamp has published one other novel , a thriller called " der eisvogel " -lrb- the kingfisher -rrb- that was hailed by literary critics but had a first run of only 163 copies .
he also writes poetry and lives in freiburg where he now writes full-time .
book critics were full of praise for " der turm , " but warned that the book is not light reading with its ponderous metaphors and poetic style .
some said he could one day be recognized as a " great german author . "
experiencing history through literature sabine franke of the german daily frankfurter rundschau said that the novel " is not about uncovering facts , but about experiencing history through literature .
this is a book for insiders -lrb- former east germans -rrb- , for those who remember , who were there themselves .
but at the same time , it is a book for posterity and parallel worlds , for those who come after and for whom this moment in history can only be contemplated from the outside . "
the five other finalists were dietmar dath for " die abschaffung der arten " -lrb- " the abolition of the species " -rrb- ; sherko fatah for " das dunkle schiff " -lrb- " the dark ship " -rrb- ; iris hanika for " treffen sich zwei " -lrb- " when two meet " -rrb- ; rolf lappert for " nach hause schwimmen " -lrb- " swimming home " -rrb- ; and ingo schulze for " adam und evelyn " -lrb- " adam and evelyn " -rrb- .
tellkamp was awarded 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 dollars -rrb- in prize money and the runners-up were each awarded 2,500 euros .
the german book prize showcases young and upcoming literary talent , launching them on the international scene .
last year 's winner was julia franck , whose novel " die mittagsfrau " has already been translated into several languages . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the long term , it could mean more eu-wide regulation . recent days have seen european governments galloping to the rescue of struggling banks , approving mergers and announcing billion-euro bailouts .
in the process , they 've threatened to ride roughshod over the european union 's strict limits on state aid to the private sector .
that is the view of neelie kroes , the commissioner in charge of competition for the eu , who used the wild west analogy in a sharply-worded speech in brussels on monday , oct .
13 .
an anything-goes atmosphere would be a “ recipe for chaos , ” kroes warned .
yet it ’ s unlikely that europe ’ s financial crisis will turn into a spaghetti western .
in the long run , the banking crisis will likely mean more unity in europe ’ s financial sector , say leading economists and eu banking experts .
in crisis mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current crisis has been likened to the wild west the top priority for eu leaders in recent days has been to unfreeze the credit markets .
all other concerns have taken a back seat .
more than a half dozen european countries announced bailout plans monday , with germany alone putting together a rescue package worth as much as 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 671 billion -rrb- .
“ the agenda is dominated by crisis management .
everything is suspended until we 're out of the crisis , ” iain begg , an expert on eu policies and fiscal issues at the london school of economics , told deutsche welle .
yet after the immediate crisis stabilizes , europe will need to take a broader look at its banking sector .
improving competition and regulation were issues before the crisis and now have become even more so , begg and others said .
finding a solution even as european governments announced 1.4 trillion euros in guarantees and other emergency measures , they stopped short of a one-size-fits-all bailout .
specific actions were left up to individual countries and no europe-wide fund has been established to help other countries ' troubled banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are calls for large banks to be regulated differently still , that level of unity was remarkable for the euro area , said nicolas veron of bruegel , a european think tank devoted to international economics . “ what is sure is that the europeans have reacted quickly to the crisis and that was not a foregone conclusion , ” veron told deutsche welle .
european markets reacted positively , jumping 9 percent on monday.the hope is that government guarantees will help banks overcome their reluctance to lend money to one another .
opening up competition yet veron cautioned against the idea that the road ahead would be easy .
“ what was announced yesterday will not magically solve all the problems , ” veron said .
“ the implementation will be very difficult . ”
a few hours after offering up her wild west criticism , kroes made public rules for eu member states to follow when rescuing banks .
all banks which operate in a country have to be covered by guarantees , kroes said .
this is an implied criticism of ireland , which on sept .

13 ahead of a major eu summit in brussels . " of course we understand that in financially difficult moments governments become defensive , but it is our duty to call the attention of governments and the public to responsibility , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso told journalists .
the eu has been " driving " the global climate debate , but there will be a " real problem of credibility for europe at a time when we expect others to come closer to our position " if the bloc weakens its own targets , he warned .
in march 2007 eu leaders pledged to cut the bloc 's emissions of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 , the gas most linked with global warming -rrb- to 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
in january , the european commission proposed laws detailing how this should be done .
the proposals call on member states to accept binding targets for cutting non-industrial emissions and commits heavy industries to buying permits to emit co2 in a bid to make it cost-effective for them to invest in clean technology .
eu leaders meeting in brussels on wednesday had been tipped to re-state their commitment to the targets in an effort to maintain diplomatic leverage ahead of international talks in december .
leaders criticize targets in current financial climate but in the wake of the financial crisis , some member states , such as italy , the czech republic and poland , have criticized the targets , saying that the climate-change package would drive businesses bust or force them to leave europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants emission cuts to encourage others barroso rejected that criticism , instead making an impassioned plea to eu states to back the emissions cuts as a way of persuading other major economies to follow suit .
" if the message from the eu here is that climate change is no longer urgent , that would be the end of the global effort , " he said .
eu officials say they hope member states will approve the commission climate-change proposals in december .
also on tuesday , environmental groups greenpeace and wwf called on eu leaders to stick to their climate commitments .
" it would be a big strategic error to backslide because of the economic downturn at such a critical moment .
everyone should have learned from today 's financial crisis that there are serious consequences for lack of early regulation , " wwf climate expert delia villagrasa wrote . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , in a ceremony that precludes the frankfurt book fair , the world 's premier publishing event .
the german book prize recognizes novels with a broad international appeal .
there is a three-step selection process in which a panel of judges select 20 titles , six of which are then short-listed .
tellkamp 's nearly 1,000-page tome is about the disintegration of former east germany , leading to the collapse of the communist regime in 1989 .
the semi-autobiographical saga spans three generations of a of an elite group of dresden intellectuals and artists living in an ivory tower high above the baroque city that was once called the florence of the elbe and demolished by allied bombs at the end of the war .
the main protagonist , who is the son of a doctor and a nurse , rebels against the system as the novel traverses east german literary circles , political institutions , schools and clinics .
author jailed in communist east germany tellkamp , 39 , is a medical doctor who wrote " der turm " between hospital shifts .
he was born in dresden and jailed for his " political unreliability " just before the communist regime dissolved and germany was reunified .
afterwards , tellkamp embarked on his medical studies in newyork and the eastern german city of leipzig before working as a doctor in a dresden clinic .
bildunterschrift : the former eastern baroque city of dresden is the backdrop of an epic that spans three generations tellkamp has published one other novel , a thriller called " der eisvogel " -lrb- the kingfisher -rrb- that was hailed by literary critics but had a first run of only 163 copies .
he also writes poetry and lives in freiburg where he now writes full-time .
book critics were full of praise for " der turm , " but warned that the book is not light reading with its ponderous metaphors and poetic style .
some said he could one day be recognized as a " great german author . "
experiencing history through literature sabine franke of the german daily frankfurter rundschau said that the novel " is not about uncovering facts , but about experiencing history through literature .

13 , postponed any decision to resume partnership talks with russia amid disagreements over whether moscow has complied with a peace deal in georgia . meeting in luxembourg , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states " noted with satisfaction that ...
russian troops have withdrawn from the zones adjacent to -lrb- the georgian breakaway regions of -rrb- south ossetia and abkhazia , " a joint statement said .
however , while the move is " an essential additional step " in the implementation of an eu-sponsored peace plan , the ministers " called on the parties to implement their commitments , " including by giving access to eu and un observers , the statement said .
the decision dashes the hopes of those eu member states which had said that russia 's withdrawal from the so-called " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions was enough for the bloc to re-open talks on a wide-ranging strategic deal .
ahead of the meeting , germany and italy stressed that it was " in the eu 's interest " to re-open talks on a successor to the current eu-russia partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many russian troops have pulled out but some remain german deputy foreign minister guenter gloser said , " there will always be some people who think the eu is doing russia a favor " with the negotiations .
but we must ask whether -lrb- the eu -rrb- would be doing itself a favor by blocking relations , given , in particular , the importance of russian fuel supplies to europe . "
and the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , proposed that ministers respond to russia 's pull-out by agreeing to re-launch talks in november .
but that proposal fell foul of resistance from eu states such as britain , poland , sweden and the baltic states , who argued that russia had not pulled its troops back to the positions they occupied before war with georgia broke out on aug .
7 , as eu leaders had demanded .
" they have made some withdrawals , primarily from the buffer zones , but there are areas which they are occupying now where they were not on aug .
7 , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said on his arrival in luxembourg .
" we have to take it fairly slowly , " added finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who currently chairs the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
russian troops allegedly still in georgia on thursday , osce monitors said moscow had pulled its forces out of the buffer zones adjacent to the separatist enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia , one day ahead of the oct .
10 deadline brokered by the eu .
but osce officials also said russian troops were still present in the akhalgori area of georgia , and french foreign minister bernard kouchner on monday acknowledged that " problems remain . "
those problems dominated talks , with ministers agreeing to make no move until they see how events unfold on the ground in georgia and how russia behaves in international talks on the crisis , set to open in geneva on wednesday .
" in due course we can address the pca -lrb- successor -rrb- , " british foreign minister david miliband said , " but at the moment we should be focusing on ensuring that all the elements that were agreed in september , including the geneva talks , get going with proper speed . "
bildunterschrift : from left , eu foreign policy chief javier solana , european commission president jose manuel barroso , french president nicolas sarkozy , russian president dmitry medvedev luxembourg 's jean asselborn acknowledged that a decision on re-starting the post-pca talks would not likely be made much before an eu-russia summit , due to take place on nov .
14 in nice .
" one solution could be to wait for the -lrb- european -rrb- commission 's report and then start the negotiations before the nov , 14 summit , " asselborn said .
some parts of agreement still unfulfilled kouchner noted that the ceasefire deal ending the russia-georgia conflict in august was not being entirely respected .
while still contesting russia 's backing for breakaway georgian territories south ossetia and abkhazia , the ministers are expected to decide that russia has kept its commitments by withdrawing troops from a buffer zone around the contested territories .
kouchner reaffirmed that russia had withdrawn its troops from buffer zones near the two breakaway georgian regions , in line with a french-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the russians have withdrawn , and apart from south ossetia and abkhazia , there are no more russia soldiers in georgia , " he said .
" we postponed " the partnership negotiations at an emergency summit on georgia on sept .
1 , called after russia recognized the independence of rebel abkhazia and south ossetia , he recalled .
but he said that of the six-points in the peace agreement reached on aug .
12 between french president nicolas sarkozy and his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev , " we have fulfilled between two and three " points .
" problems remain and we will analyze them , " he said .

the gloomy news was a sharp contrast to a strong showing by european stock markets on tuesday . the world financial crisis will bring germany 's economic growth nearly to a halt , according to a twice-yearly economic report released in berlin .
the economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2009 to just 0.2 percent .
previously , the institutes had projected 1.4 percent growth .
germany is expected to finish out 2008 with an overall growth rate of 1.8 percent .
" the german economy is on the edge of a recession , " said udo ludwig from the iwh economic institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends on high-end exports for its well-being germany , the world 's leading export nation , faces a sharp fall in foreign demand as the world economy slows .
the weaker growth outlook could result in job losses of 400,000 in germany next year , the institutes also warned .
germany 's economy ministry will unveil its own growth estimates on thursday , which are also expected to be revised sharply lower .
investor confidence plunges these growth rates make up the economists ' " basic scenario . "
but in view of the exceptionally high level of uncertainty brought by the international financial crisis , the economists also drew up a more pessimistic " risk scenario . "
in this scenario , the german economy would actually contract by 0.8 percent next year .
but the experts said they do expect the economy to stabilize by the end of 2009 , according to the report .
the institutes participating in the study include ifo in munich , ifw in kiel , rwi in essen and iwh in halle , together with the austrian think tanks wifo and ihs and switzerland 's kof .
germany 's zew index of financial sector confidence , also released tuesday , plunged this month .
however , the institute said it would likely rebound following a major european bank rescue plan announced sunday .
the indicator fell by 21.9 points to minus 63.0 points , the second lowest level since the start of the survey in december 1991 .
the zew economic research institute said its results had been gathered in the heat of the international financial crisis .
france , britain also struggling germany is n't alone in looking ahead to tough economic times .
the bank of france predicted growth will drop to minus 0.1 percent in the third quarter , showing the country was heading into recession after a 0.3 percent contraction in the previous three months , according to a report released tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stock market has been on a wild ride britain 's inflation rate was also reported to have reached a 16-year high of 5.2 percent in september , afp news agency reported tuesday .
britain 's statistics office said higher gas and electricity costs have fueled the increases .
the inflation level is more than double the government 's 2 percent target .
economists said they believe inflation will level off and return to the target level by the end of 2009 .
stocks soar on rescue plan the dour outlook was in sharp contrast to stock price increases around europe .
investors took comfort in the coordinated european bank rescue plans announced monday .
in morning deals on tuesday , european shares rose nearly 5 percent .
frankfurt was trading 3.14 percent higher early on tuesday .
the paris stock market jumped 4.18 percent , a day after rising more than 11 percent , its largest-ever one-day gain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 14.10.2008 daimler to slash us jobs as vw bucks economic downturn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler production lines in the us and canada are being closed and moved to mexico german auto giant daimler will eliminate 3,500 north american jobs owing to the worsening economic slowdown .
vw , however , bucked the downward trend and set record highs for its shares on the stock market . following announcements by nissan , renault , and volvo in europe , and restructuring by general motors and ford , utility vehicles are also unveiling hits from slumping sales .
in the united states , the market deteriorated " in a way we have not anticipated , " daimler trucks boss andreas renschler told a telephone press conference .
he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .
" as the recession deepens , the heavy-truck market is hit harder , " german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer told reporters .
" the sector will see a recession as well . "
in addition , a daimler spokeswoman told reporters , the sector is subject to regular cycles , and the german group had already expected diminished demand late this year and early in 2009 .
" it is falling back more sharply now , " she noted however .
finally , new us regulations aimed at reducing pollution have also hurt sales , daimler said .
the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .
production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .
as the deadline for porsche 's takeover approaches , those banks must make sure they own the shares in question .
brokers have said banks probably waited until the last minute in a bet that vw shares would fall because of the financial crisis and might be scrambling now to cover their positions .
mystery surrounds investors another hypothesis is that speculative investment funds may have targeted vw shares with the practice of short selling , in which they borrow shares that are immediately sold in expectation of being able to repurchase them later at a cheaper price before they must be returned to the original owner .
if that were the case , funds could also be buying heavily to make sure they can return the vw stock without suffering even heavier losses .
" people must unwind short positions because they are losing money , " baader bank strategist robert halver told reporters .
but in the end , even market specialists say that " no one knows who is holding the positions , who the speculative funds might be , who is buying or selling for porsche , " in the words of bhf-bank analyst albrecht denninghoff .
" we do not know how many people are on board the ship .
" there is no transparency in the markets .
at that point , anything is possible . "
halver goes even further , saying that even funds caught short trying to profit from short selling would not fully explain vw 's soaring share price .
" it is just not possible , " he said .
" bafin should open an investigation , " halver added in reference to germany 's financial market regulator .
a spokeswoman for the market watchdog told the afp news agency it is examining the data .
“ it is not a formal investigation , " she added . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , in a ceremony that precludes the frankfurt book fair , the world 's premier publishing event .
the german book prize recognizes novels with a broad international appeal .
there is a three-step selection process in which a panel of judges select 20 titles , six of which are then short-listed .
tellkamp 's nearly 1,000-page tome is about the disintegration of former east germany , leading to the collapse of the communist regime in 1989 .
the semi-autobiographical saga spans three generations of a of an elite group of dresden intellectuals and artists living in an ivory tower high above the baroque city that was once called the florence of the elbe and demolished by allied bombs at the end of the war .
the main protagonist , who is the son of a doctor and a nurse , rebels against the system as the novel traverses east german literary circles , political institutions , schools and clinics .
author jailed in communist east germany tellkamp , 39 , is a medical doctor who wrote " der turm " between hospital shifts .
he was born in dresden and jailed for his " political unreliability " just before the communist regime dissolved and germany was reunified .
afterwards , tellkamp embarked on his medical studies in newyork and the eastern german city of leipzig before working as a doctor in a dresden clinic .
bildunterschrift : the former eastern baroque city of dresden is the backdrop of an epic that spans three generations tellkamp has published one other novel , a thriller called " der eisvogel " -lrb- the kingfisher -rrb- that was hailed by literary critics but had a first run of only 163 copies .
he also writes poetry and lives in freiburg where he now writes full-time .
book critics were full of praise for " der turm , " but warned that the book is not light reading with its ponderous metaphors and poetic style .
some said he could one day be recognized as a " great german author . "
experiencing history through literature sabine franke of the german daily frankfurter rundschau said that the novel " is not about uncovering facts , but about experiencing history through literature .
this is a book for insiders -lrb- former east germans -rrb- , for those who remember , who were there themselves .
but at the same time , it is a book for posterity and parallel worlds , for those who come after and for whom this moment in history can only be contemplated from the outside . "
the five other finalists were dietmar dath for " die abschaffung der arten " -lrb- " the abolition of the species " -rrb- ; sherko fatah for " das dunkle schiff " -lrb- " the dark ship " -rrb- ; iris hanika for " treffen sich zwei " -lrb- " when two meet " -rrb- ; rolf lappert for " nach hause schwimmen " -lrb- " swimming home " -rrb- ; and ingo schulze for " adam und evelyn " -lrb- " adam and evelyn " -rrb- .
tellkamp was awarded 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 dollars -rrb- in prize money and the runners-up were each awarded 2,500 euros .
the german book prize showcases young and upcoming literary talent , launching them on the international scene .

13 , postponed any decision to resume partnership talks with russia amid disagreements over whether moscow has complied with a peace deal in georgia . meeting in luxembourg , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states " noted with satisfaction that ...
russian troops have withdrawn from the zones adjacent to -lrb- the georgian breakaway regions of -rrb- south ossetia and abkhazia , " a joint statement said .
however , while the move is " an essential additional step " in the implementation of an eu-sponsored peace plan , the ministers " called on the parties to implement their commitments , " including by giving access to eu and un observers , the statement said .
the decision dashes the hopes of those eu member states which had said that russia 's withdrawal from the so-called " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions was enough for the bloc to re-open talks on a wide-ranging strategic deal .
ahead of the meeting , germany and italy stressed that it was " in the eu 's interest " to re-open talks on a successor to the current eu-russia partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many russian troops have pulled out but some remain german deputy foreign minister guenter gloser said , " there will always be some people who think the eu is doing russia a favor " with the negotiations .
but we must ask whether -lrb- the eu -rrb- would be doing itself a favor by blocking relations , given , in particular , the importance of russian fuel supplies to europe . "
and the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , proposed that ministers respond to russia 's pull-out by agreeing to re-launch talks in november .
but that proposal fell foul of resistance from eu states such as britain , poland , sweden and the baltic states , who argued that russia had not pulled its troops back to the positions they occupied before war with georgia broke out on aug .
7 , as eu leaders had demanded .
" they have made some withdrawals , primarily from the buffer zones , but there are areas which they are occupying now where they were not on aug .
7 , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said on his arrival in luxembourg .
" we have to take it fairly slowly , " added finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who currently chairs the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
russian troops allegedly still in georgia on thursday , osce monitors said moscow had pulled its forces out of the buffer zones adjacent to the separatist enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia , one day ahead of the oct .
10 deadline brokered by the eu .
but osce officials also said russian troops were still present in the akhalgori area of georgia , and french foreign minister bernard kouchner on monday acknowledged that " problems remain . "
those problems dominated talks , with ministers agreeing to make no move until they see how events unfold on the ground in georgia and how russia behaves in international talks on the crisis , set to open in geneva on wednesday .
" in due course we can address the pca -lrb- successor -rrb- , " british foreign minister david miliband said , " but at the moment we should be focusing on ensuring that all the elements that were agreed in september , including the geneva talks , get going with proper speed . "
bildunterschrift : from left , eu foreign policy chief javier solana , european commission president jose manuel barroso , french president nicolas sarkozy , russian president dmitry medvedev luxembourg 's jean asselborn acknowledged that a decision on re-starting the post-pca talks would not likely be made much before an eu-russia summit , due to take place on nov .
14 in nice .
" one solution could be to wait for the -lrb- european -rrb- commission 's report and then start the negotiations before the nov , 14 summit , " asselborn said .
some parts of agreement still unfulfilled kouchner noted that the ceasefire deal ending the russia-georgia conflict in august was not being entirely respected .
while still contesting russia 's backing for breakaway georgian territories south ossetia and abkhazia , the ministers are expected to decide that russia has kept its commitments by withdrawing troops from a buffer zone around the contested territories .
kouchner reaffirmed that russia had withdrawn its troops from buffer zones near the two breakaway georgian regions , in line with a french-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the russians have withdrawn , and apart from south ossetia and abkhazia , there are no more russia soldiers in georgia , " he said .
" we postponed " the partnership negotiations at an emergency summit on georgia on sept .
1 , called after russia recognized the independence of rebel abkhazia and south ossetia , he recalled .
but he said that of the six-points in the peace agreement reached on aug .
12 between french president nicolas sarkozy and his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev , " we have fulfilled between two and three " points .
" problems remain and we will analyze them , " he said .

13 , at the dead sea resort in amman by urging continuation of peace talks between israel and palestine .
president of the european union hans-gert pottering , who also serves as president-in-office of empa , called for speedy solutions to two issues that hinder the peace negotiations : " the expansion of settlements , which is undermining the palestinians ' confidence " in the peace process , and " the extremely restricted freedom of movement of palestinians , " which has hindered investment in the palestinian economy and prevented economic recovery .
worries of fading interest given that empa countries provide 60 percent of all aid to the palestinians , pottering warned of the need to prevent donors being overcome by " a certain fatigue , or lack of interest in the fate of the palestinians . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.10.2008 europe 's bank rescue signals end of era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european stock markets rebounded after the bailouts were announced big changes are in store for european banks after the latest round of bailouts were announced .
in the long term , it could mean more eu-wide regulation . recent days have seen european governments galloping to the rescue of struggling banks , approving mergers and announcing billion-euro bailouts .
in the process , they 've threatened to ride roughshod over the european union 's strict limits on state aid to the private sector .
that is the view of neelie kroes , the commissioner in charge of competition for the eu , who used the wild west analogy in a sharply-worded speech in brussels on monday , oct .
13 .
an anything-goes atmosphere would be a “ recipe for chaos , ” kroes warned .
yet it ’ s unlikely that europe ’ s financial crisis will turn into a spaghetti western .
in the long run , the banking crisis will likely mean more unity in europe ’ s financial sector , say leading economists and eu banking experts .
in crisis mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current crisis has been likened to the wild west the top priority for eu leaders in recent days has been to unfreeze the credit markets .
all other concerns have taken a back seat .
more than a half dozen european countries announced bailout plans monday , with germany alone putting together a rescue package worth as much as 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 671 billion -rrb- .
“ the agenda is dominated by crisis management .
everything is suspended until we 're out of the crisis , ” iain begg , an expert on eu policies and fiscal issues at the london school of economics , told deutsche welle .
yet after the immediate crisis stabilizes , europe will need to take a broader look at its banking sector .
improving competition and regulation were issues before the crisis and now have become even more so , begg and others said .
finding a solution even as european governments announced 1.4 trillion euros in guarantees and other emergency measures , they stopped short of a one-size-fits-all bailout .
specific actions were left up to individual countries and no europe-wide fund has been established to help other countries ' troubled banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are calls for large banks to be regulated differently still , that level of unity was remarkable for the euro area , said nicolas veron of bruegel , a european think tank devoted to international economics . “ what is sure is that the europeans have reacted quickly to the crisis and that was not a foregone conclusion , ” veron told deutsche welle .
european markets reacted positively , jumping 9 percent on monday.the hope is that government guarantees will help banks overcome their reluctance to lend money to one another .
opening up competition yet veron cautioned against the idea that the road ahead would be easy .
“ what was announced yesterday will not magically solve all the problems , ” veron said .
“ the implementation will be very difficult . ”
a few hours after offering up her wild west criticism , kroes made public rules for eu member states to follow when rescuing banks .
all banks which operate in a country have to be covered by guarantees , kroes said .
this is an implied criticism of ireland , which on sept .
30 proposed covering only deposits in irish-owned banks .
the government has since revised the proposal to include non-irish banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has promised 500 billion euros “ we 've had problems with competition in europe for a long time .
most european bank markets are heavily dominated by national firms , ” said fredrik erixon , the director of the european center for international political economy -lrb- ecipe -rrb- , a think tank dedicated to trade and other international issues of importance to europe . yet multinational banks pose their own set of problems , erixon and others point out .
who would pick up the bill for bailing out the british subsidiary , say , of spain 's banco santander ?
or who would come to the rescue of the spanish arm of deutsche bank ? and would it be enough to tighten regulations on european banks ?

in the long term , it could mean more eu-wide regulation . recent days have seen european governments galloping to the rescue of struggling banks , approving mergers and announcing billion-euro bailouts .
in the process , they 've threatened to ride roughshod over the european union 's strict limits on state aid to the private sector .
that is the view of neelie kroes , the commissioner in charge of competition for the eu , who used the wild west analogy in a sharply-worded speech in brussels on monday , oct .
13 .
an anything-goes atmosphere would be a “ recipe for chaos , ” kroes warned .
yet it ’ s unlikely that europe ’ s financial crisis will turn into a spaghetti western .
in the long run , the banking crisis will likely mean more unity in europe ’ s financial sector , say leading economists and eu banking experts .
in crisis mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current crisis has been likened to the wild west the top priority for eu leaders in recent days has been to unfreeze the credit markets .
all other concerns have taken a back seat .
more than a half dozen european countries announced bailout plans monday , with germany alone putting together a rescue package worth as much as 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 671 billion -rrb- .
“ the agenda is dominated by crisis management .
everything is suspended until we 're out of the crisis , ” iain begg , an expert on eu policies and fiscal issues at the london school of economics , told deutsche welle .

specific actions were left up to individual countries and no europe-wide fund has been established to help other countries ' troubled banks .

european markets reacted positively , jumping 9 percent on monday.the hope is that government guarantees will help banks overcome their reluctance to lend money to one another .
opening up competition yet veron cautioned against the idea that the road ahead would be easy .
“ what was announced yesterday will not magically solve all the problems , ” veron said .
“ the implementation will be very difficult . ”
a few hours after offering up her wild west criticism , kroes made public rules for eu member states to follow when rescuing banks .
all banks which operate in a country have to be covered by guarantees , kroes said .
this is an implied criticism of ireland , which on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.10.2008 europe 's bank rescue signals end of era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european stock markets rebounded after the bailouts were announced big changes are in store for european banks after the latest round of bailouts were announced .
in the long term , it could mean more eu-wide regulation . recent days have seen european governments galloping to the rescue of struggling banks , approving mergers and announcing billion-euro bailouts .
in the process , they 've threatened to ride roughshod over the european union 's strict limits on state aid to the private sector .
that is the view of neelie kroes , the commissioner in charge of competition for the eu , who used the wild west analogy in a sharply-worded speech in brussels on monday , oct .
13 .
an anything-goes atmosphere would be a “ recipe for chaos , ” kroes warned .
yet it ’ s unlikely that europe ’ s financial crisis will turn into a spaghetti western .
in the long run , the banking crisis will likely mean more unity in europe ’ s financial sector , say leading economists and eu banking experts .
in crisis mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current crisis has been likened to the wild west the top priority for eu leaders in recent days has been to unfreeze the credit markets .
all other concerns have taken a back seat .
more than a half dozen european countries announced bailout plans monday , with germany alone putting together a rescue package worth as much as 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 671 billion -rrb- .
“ the agenda is dominated by crisis management .
everything is suspended until we 're out of the crisis , ” iain begg , an expert on eu policies and fiscal issues at the london school of economics , told deutsche welle .
yet after the immediate crisis stabilizes , europe will need to take a broader look at its banking sector .
improving competition and regulation were issues before the crisis and now have become even more so , begg and others said .
finding a solution even as european governments announced 1.4 trillion euros in guarantees and other emergency measures , they stopped short of a one-size-fits-all bailout .
specific actions were left up to individual countries and no europe-wide fund has been established to help other countries ' troubled banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are calls for large banks to be regulated differently still , that level of unity was remarkable for the euro area , said nicolas veron of bruegel , a european think tank devoted to international economics . “ what is sure is that the europeans have reacted quickly to the crisis and that was not a foregone conclusion , ” veron told deutsche welle .
european markets reacted positively , jumping 9 percent on monday.the hope is that government guarantees will help banks overcome their reluctance to lend money to one another .
opening up competition yet veron cautioned against the idea that the road ahead would be easy .
“ what was announced yesterday will not magically solve all the problems , ” veron said .
“ the implementation will be very difficult . ”
a few hours after offering up her wild west criticism , kroes made public rules for eu member states to follow when rescuing banks .
all banks which operate in a country have to be covered by guarantees , kroes said .
this is an implied criticism of ireland , which on sept .
30 proposed covering only deposits in irish-owned banks .
the government has since revised the proposal to include non-irish banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has promised 500 billion euros “ we 've had problems with competition in europe for a long time .
most european bank markets are heavily dominated by national firms , ” said fredrik erixon , the director of the european center for international political economy -lrb- ecipe -rrb- , a think tank dedicated to trade and other international issues of importance to europe . yet multinational banks pose their own set of problems , erixon and others point out .
who would pick up the bill for bailing out the british subsidiary , say , of spain 's banco santander ?
or who would come to the rescue of the spanish arm of deutsche bank ? and would it be enough to tighten regulations on european banks ?
erixon said the worry is that people would then shift investments to asia and the us where regulations did n't exist . economists just do n't know exactly what the upcoming days and months will bring . “ we are still in the phase of crisis reaction , ” erixon said .
it 's an ending that remains to be written . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mp3 players and mobile phones cranked up to high volumes are the main culprits , a study by european scientists shows . any more than five hours of loud music through headphones has the potential to cause permanent hearing loss , according to a study done for the european commission , the european union 's executive arm .
the study said that children and teenagers need to be protected from " leisure noise . "
loud mobile phones were also criticized .
" there has been increasing concern about exposure from the new generation of personal music players which can reproduce sounds at very high volumes without loss of quality , " the commission said in a statement .
young people pose special risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stop the noise !
experts estimated that between 50 and 100 million europeans listen to portable music players on a daily basis .
if those players are cranked up to more than 89 decibels for five hours a week , the resulting noise would exceed eu limits for workplace noise .
if listened to for longer periods , hearing damage is a concern .
between 5 and 10 percent of listeners - 10 million europeans - are in danger of having hearing loss , according to the study .
" i am concerned that so many young people ... who are frequent users of personal music players and mobile phones at high acoustic levels , may be unknowingly damaging their hearing irrevocably , " meglena kuneva , the eu 's consumer affairs commissioner , said in the statement . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , postponed any decision to resume partnership talks with russia amid disagreements over whether moscow has complied with a peace deal in georgia . meeting in luxembourg , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states " noted with satisfaction that ...
russian troops have withdrawn from the zones adjacent to -lrb- the georgian breakaway regions of -rrb- south ossetia and abkhazia , " a joint statement said .
however , while the move is " an essential additional step " in the implementation of an eu-sponsored peace plan , the ministers " called on the parties to implement their commitments , " including by giving access to eu and un observers , the statement said .
the decision dashes the hopes of those eu member states which had said that russia 's withdrawal from the so-called " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions was enough for the bloc to re-open talks on a wide-ranging strategic deal .
ahead of the meeting , germany and italy stressed that it was " in the eu 's interest " to re-open talks on a successor to the current eu-russia partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many russian troops have pulled out but some remain german deputy foreign minister guenter gloser said , " there will always be some people who think the eu is doing russia a favor " with the negotiations .
but we must ask whether -lrb- the eu -rrb- would be doing itself a favor by blocking relations , given , in particular , the importance of russian fuel supplies to europe . "
and the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , proposed that ministers respond to russia 's pull-out by agreeing to re-launch talks in november .
but that proposal fell foul of resistance from eu states such as britain , poland , sweden and the baltic states , who argued that russia had not pulled its troops back to the positions they occupied before war with georgia broke out on aug .

ahead of the summit , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that europe and the rest of the world must rethink financial regulation and supervisory rules , including for hedge funds and private equity , once the crisis subsides .
he said he was encouraged by stock market surges following sunday 's adoption of a coordinated 2.2 trillion euro -lrb- $ 3,023 billion -rrb- rescue plan for banks in eurozone countries .
" once we have put financial markets back on their feet , we must ensure that in the future , they function properly for the benefit of citizens and businesses , rather than themselves , " barroso said .
german news agency dpa has reported that diplomats expect the eu summit to throw its weight behind the euro-group decision rather than proposing new measures .
mending ties with russia the second crisis on the eu 's agenda ?
whether or not it should re-open talks with russia on a key strategic partnership which were frozen in the wake of the summer 's russian-georgian war .
at an emergency summit on sept .
1 , leaders agreed there would be no further talks " until troops have withdrawn to the positions held prior to aug .
7 , " the day that fighting began .
russia withdrew from " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia on oct .
9 , but has more than doubled its troop presence in the regions , occupying formerly georgian-held positions there .
this has left eu states at odds over whether conditions for restarting the talks have been fulfilled .
" for me , it 's clear that we have to start the negotiations because the spirit of the agreement has been fulfilled , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
but swedish foreign minister carl bildt disagreed .
" if you look at the maps , -lrb- the russians -rrb- are not back to the positions they held prior to aug .
7 , " he said .
ireland to report on lisbon treaty finally , the summit is set to hear a report from the irish government on the country 's rejection of the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 .
the " no " vote threw the bloc into institutional panic as the treaty can not come into effect without being ratified by every member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit will give ireland another chance to express itself the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the eu 's institutions and increase efficiency and transparency to voters .
but in ireland , many voters reported feeling confused and poorly informed about the consequences of the referendum .
there were fears that voting " yes " to the treaty would lead to ireland 's arm being twisted on such sensitive issues as military neutrality and abortion rights .
ahead of the summit , european commission vice president margot wallstroem told the irish times that she has warned member states not to push ireland into a decision about whether to hold a second referendum .
" the irish should not be forced or pushed or pressed into taking a decision that they do n't feel ready for , " she said .
she added that rumors that eu politicians would move ahead without ireland were " unrealistic . "
" there might be those who will want to go ahead on their own , but i think it is totally unrealistic , " wallstroem said .
" nobody wants to see ireland out of the eu and that is certainly not the wish of the irish people . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian negotiators said they would not show up unless the two regions , which russia has recognized as independent nations , had a seat at the table for the talks scheduled for wednesday in the swiss capital .
" without them , we wo n't go to geneva , " deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said in a statement .
but before boarding a plane to geneva , the head of the georgian delegation said : " the georgian side will not allow it .
" representatives from abkhazia and the so-called south ossetia will not take part in negotiations in geneva , " deputy foreign minister grigol vashadze was quoted by news agency interfax as saying .
moscow flew in the face of western criticism and recognized the two regions as independent after routing a georgian offensive to take back control over south ossetia in august .

georgian media cited the osce as saying that representatives of south ossetia and abkhazia were attending without giving further details .
russian news wires reported that these representatives could be folded into the russian delegation .
vashadze said georgia 's agenda was clear : " the full withdrawal of russian occupiers from georgia , the return of all refugees and the restoration of georgia 's integrity to its internationally recognized borders . "

a german photographer and an artist won lawsuits against google for displaying thumbnails of their works in search results without permission .
google will reportedly appeal the ruling . google can not display copyrighted works as thumbnails without an owner 's permission , a court in the northern german city of hamburg ruled on tuesday , oct 14 .
since the photos in google image search are displayed as thumbnails , no new work is created , which leaves no justification for displaying the copywrited works without permission , the court ruled .
" it does n't matter that thumbnails are much smaller than original pictures and are displayed in a lower resolution , " the court said in its ruling .
artists complain google 's image search function brings up often millions of thumbnails of photographs , pictures and other graphics culled from internet sites .
google always has a disclaimed next to images that they might be scaled down and also might be subject to copyright .
but for some that is not enough .
they do not want their images to show up in the search engine at all .
german photographer michael bernhard and artist thomas horn brought cases against google in germany to protest the display of their copyrighted images .
horn , whose comic drawings were displayed on google , has reportedly asked for about 1,300 euros plus interest to compensate for his " stolen pictures . "
google likely to appeal if the ruling ends up keeping all copyrighted images from being displayed in google , that " capitulates us into the digital stone age , " kay oberbeck , spokeswoman for google germany was quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper as saying .
google will appeal the ruling , the newspaper reported .
but if it is upheld , it could mean that google would have to turn off its image search function , the hamburger abendblatt reported .

since the photos in google image search are displayed as thumbnails , no new work is created , which leaves no justification for displaying the copywrited works without permission , the court ruled .
" it does n't matter that thumbnails are much smaller than original pictures and are displayed in a lower resolution , " the court said in its ruling .
artists complain google 's image search function brings up often millions of thumbnails of photographs , pictures and other graphics culled from internet sites .
google always has a disclaimed next to images that they might be scaled down and also might be subject to copyright .
but for some that is not enough .
they do not want their images to show up in the search engine at all .
german photographer michael bernhard and artist thomas horn brought cases against google in germany to protest the display of their copyrighted images .
horn , whose comic drawings were displayed on google , has reportedly asked for about 1,300 euros plus interest to compensate for his " stolen pictures . "
google likely to appeal if the ruling ends up keeping all copyrighted images from being displayed in google , that " capitulates us into the digital stone age , " kay oberbeck , spokeswoman for google germany was quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper as saying .
google will appeal the ruling , the newspaper reported .
but if it is upheld , it could mean that google would have to turn off its image search function , the hamburger abendblatt reported .
the court suggested that google replace thumbnails of pictures with a text describing them , something google said is not a practical , user-friendly solution . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 14.10.2008 star defender ze roberto discusses bayern 's fall from grace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : superstar ze roberto shines , but his halo has not spread to his bayern teammates bayern munich ’ s brazilian superstar defender ze roberto , 34 , spoke to dw-world about the club 's lackluster start to the season and string of losses that have fans worrying about where germany 's premier club is heading . dw-world.de : how are you , ze ?
ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .
i have n't been able to find one .
in all my years at fc bayern munich , in my entire soccer career , i ca n't remember having such a bad start in the season .
so many people are preoccupied with finding an explanation for this -lrb- pile of successive defeats -rrb- .
my take on it is that the situation is so complex that no explanation is necessary .
we must simply work harder to reach our goal : to be at the top of the league .
what are you thinking when you look at the scoreboard and fc bayern munich is in llth place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .
this season the team has shown in a rudimentary way that it understands klinsmann 's working philosophy - in playing against cologne , against nuremburg or in the second half of the champions league playoffs against lyon .
what we 're missing is consistency and a good balance .
but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?
bildunterschrift : " now is not the time to whine and look for explanations .
the season begins anew ... "
we do n't have much time .
hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- is in the lead by seven points .
the experimental phase is over .
i 'm not the only one who knows that .
our coach knows that too .
now is not the time to keep whining or look for explanations .
we need to get our act together for upcoming games .
the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .
second , even if i had talked to fc bayern or another club about commitments starting 2009 , i would give them all the same answer : this is not the right time to discuss such matters .
i 'm only going to start thinking about my future starting in february or march of next year .
at the moment , i 'm fully focused on the current season .
third of all , a final decision of where to go or stay would be made in conjunction with my whole family .
regardless of what the future holds , my wife , my kids and i feel very much at home in munich .
fans of fc bayern munich would perhaps want to see more of you , the ze roberto , who grows better with age .
meanwhile i almost believe in my old motto .
i recently said that i 'm like a good old bottle of wine : with age , i always get better .
that seems to be the case right now . daniel martinez -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

vw , however , bucked the downward trend and set record highs for its shares on the stock market . following announcements by nissan , renault , and volvo in europe , and restructuring by general motors and ford , utility vehicles are also unveiling hits from slumping sales .
in the united states , the market deteriorated " in a way we have not anticipated , " daimler trucks boss andreas renschler told a telephone press conference .
he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .
" as the recession deepens , the heavy-truck market is hit harder , " german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer told reporters .
" the sector will see a recession as well . "
in addition , a daimler spokeswoman told reporters , the sector is subject to regular cycles , and the german group had already expected diminished demand late this year and early in 2009 .
" it is falling back more sharply now , " she noted however .
finally , new us regulations aimed at reducing pollution have also hurt sales , daimler said .
the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .
production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .
as the deadline for porsche 's takeover approaches , those banks must make sure they own the shares in question .
brokers have said banks probably waited until the last minute in a bet that vw shares would fall because of the financial crisis and might be scrambling now to cover their positions .
mystery surrounds investors another hypothesis is that speculative investment funds may have targeted vw shares with the practice of short selling , in which they borrow shares that are immediately sold in expectation of being able to repurchase them later at a cheaper price before they must be returned to the original owner .
if that were the case , funds could also be buying heavily to make sure they can return the vw stock without suffering even heavier losses .
" people must unwind short positions because they are losing money , " baader bank strategist robert halver told reporters .
but in the end , even market specialists say that " no one knows who is holding the positions , who the speculative funds might be , who is buying or selling for porsche , " in the words of bhf-bank analyst albrecht denninghoff .
" we do not know how many people are on board the ship .
" there is no transparency in the markets .
at that point , anything is possible . "
halver goes even further , saying that even funds caught short trying to profit from short selling would not fully explain vw 's soaring share price .
" it is just not possible , " he said .

vw , however , bucked the downward trend and set record highs for its shares on the stock market . following announcements by nissan , renault , and volvo in europe , and restructuring by general motors and ford , utility vehicles are also unveiling hits from slumping sales .
in the united states , the market deteriorated " in a way we have not anticipated , " daimler trucks boss andreas renschler told a telephone press conference .
he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .

production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .
as the deadline for porsche 's takeover approaches , those banks must make sure they own the shares in question .
brokers have said banks probably waited until the last minute in a bet that vw shares would fall because of the financial crisis and might be scrambling now to cover their positions .
mystery surrounds investors another hypothesis is that speculative investment funds may have targeted vw shares with the practice of short selling , in which they borrow shares that are immediately sold in expectation of being able to repurchase them later at a cheaper price before they must be returned to the original owner .
if that were the case , funds could also be buying heavily to make sure they can return the vw stock without suffering even heavier losses .
" people must unwind short positions because they are losing money , " baader bank strategist robert halver told reporters .
but in the end , even market specialists say that " no one knows who is holding the positions , who the speculative funds might be , who is buying or selling for porsche , " in the words of bhf-bank analyst albrecht denninghoff .
" we do not know how many people are on board the ship .
" there is no transparency in the markets .
at that point , anything is possible . "
halver goes even further , saying that even funds caught short trying to profit from short selling would not fully explain vw 's soaring share price .
" it is just not possible , " he said .
" bafin should open an investigation , " halver added in reference to germany 's financial market regulator .
a spokeswoman for the market watchdog told the afp news agency it is examining the data .
“ it is not a formal investigation , " she added . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .
i have n't been able to find one .
in all my years at fc bayern munich , in my entire soccer career , i ca n't remember having such a bad start in the season .
so many people are preoccupied with finding an explanation for this -lrb- pile of successive defeats -rrb- .
my take on it is that the situation is so complex that no explanation is necessary .
we must simply work harder to reach our goal : to be at the top of the league .
what are you thinking when you look at the scoreboard and fc bayern munich is in llth place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .
this season the team has shown in a rudimentary way that it understands klinsmann 's working philosophy - in playing against cologne , against nuremburg or in the second half of the champions league playoffs against lyon .
what we 're missing is consistency and a good balance .
but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?
bildunterschrift : " now is not the time to whine and look for explanations .
the season begins anew ... "
we do n't have much time .
hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- is in the lead by seven points .
the experimental phase is over .
i 'm not the only one who knows that .
our coach knows that too .
now is not the time to keep whining or look for explanations .
we need to get our act together for upcoming games .
the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .
second , even if i had talked to fc bayern or another club about commitments starting 2009 , i would give them all the same answer : this is not the right time to discuss such matters .
i 'm only going to start thinking about my future starting in february or march of next year .
at the moment , i 'm fully focused on the current season .
third of all , a final decision of where to go or stay would be made in conjunction with my whole family .
regardless of what the future holds , my wife , my kids and i feel very much at home in munich .
fans of fc bayern munich would perhaps want to see more of you , the ze roberto , who grows better with age .
meanwhile i almost believe in my old motto .
i recently said that i 'm like a good old bottle of wine : with age , i always get better .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .
this season the team has shown in a rudimentary way that it understands klinsmann 's working philosophy - in playing against cologne , against nuremburg or in the second half of the champions league playoffs against lyon .
what we 're missing is consistency and a good balance .
but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?
bildunterschrift : " now is not the time to whine and look for explanations .
the season begins anew ... "
we do n't have much time .
hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- is in the lead by seven points .
the experimental phase is over .
i 'm not the only one who knows that .
our coach knows that too .
now is not the time to keep whining or look for explanations .
we need to get our act together for upcoming games .
the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .
second , even if i had talked to fc bayern or another club about commitments starting 2009 , i would give them all the same answer : this is not the right time to discuss such matters .
i 'm only going to start thinking about my future starting in february or march of next year .
at the moment , i 'm fully focused on the current season .
third of all , a final decision of where to go or stay would be made in conjunction with my whole family .
regardless of what the future holds , my wife , my kids and i feel very much at home in munich .
fans of fc bayern munich would perhaps want to see more of you , the ze roberto , who grows better with age .
meanwhile i almost believe in my old motto .
i recently said that i 'm like a good old bottle of wine : with age , i always get better .

ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 14.10.2008 daimler to slash us jobs as vw bucks economic downturn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler production lines in the us and canada are being closed and moved to mexico german auto giant daimler will eliminate 3,500 north american jobs owing to the worsening economic slowdown .
vw , however , bucked the downward trend and set record highs for its shares on the stock market . following announcements by nissan , renault , and volvo in europe , and restructuring by general motors and ford , utility vehicles are also unveiling hits from slumping sales .
in the united states , the market deteriorated " in a way we have not anticipated , " daimler trucks boss andreas renschler told a telephone press conference .
he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .
" as the recession deepens , the heavy-truck market is hit harder , " german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer told reporters .
" the sector will see a recession as well . "
in addition , a daimler spokeswoman told reporters , the sector is subject to regular cycles , and the german group had already expected diminished demand late this year and early in 2009 .
" it is falling back more sharply now , " she noted however .
finally , new us regulations aimed at reducing pollution have also hurt sales , daimler said .
the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .
production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .
as the deadline for porsche 's takeover approaches , those banks must make sure they own the shares in question .
brokers have said banks probably waited until the last minute in a bet that vw shares would fall because of the financial crisis and might be scrambling now to cover their positions .
mystery surrounds investors another hypothesis is that speculative investment funds may have targeted vw shares with the practice of short selling , in which they borrow shares that are immediately sold in expectation of being able to repurchase them later at a cheaper price before they must be returned to the original owner .
if that were the case , funds could also be buying heavily to make sure they can return the vw stock without suffering even heavier losses .
" people must unwind short positions because they are losing money , " baader bank strategist robert halver told reporters .
but in the end , even market specialists say that " no one knows who is holding the positions , who the speculative funds might be , who is buying or selling for porsche , " in the words of bhf-bank analyst albrecht denninghoff .
" we do not know how many people are on board the ship .
" there is no transparency in the markets .
at that point , anything is possible . "
halver goes even further , saying that even funds caught short trying to profit from short selling would not fully explain vw 's soaring share price .
" it is just not possible , " he said .
" bafin should open an investigation , " halver added in reference to germany 's financial market regulator .
a spokeswoman for the market watchdog told the afp news agency it is examining the data .
“ it is not a formal investigation , " she added . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

vw , however , bucked the downward trend and set record highs for its shares on the stock market . following announcements by nissan , renault , and volvo in europe , and restructuring by general motors and ford , utility vehicles are also unveiling hits from slumping sales .
in the united states , the market deteriorated " in a way we have not anticipated , " daimler trucks boss andreas renschler told a telephone press conference .
he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .
" as the recession deepens , the heavy-truck market is hit harder , " german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer told reporters .
" the sector will see a recession as well . "
in addition , a daimler spokeswoman told reporters , the sector is subject to regular cycles , and the german group had already expected diminished demand late this year and early in 2009 .
" it is falling back more sharply now , " she noted however .
finally , new us regulations aimed at reducing pollution have also hurt sales , daimler said .
the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .
production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .
as the deadline for porsche 's takeover approaches , those banks must make sure they own the shares in question .
brokers have said banks probably waited until the last minute in a bet that vw shares would fall because of the financial crisis and might be scrambling now to cover their positions .
mystery surrounds investors another hypothesis is that speculative investment funds may have targeted vw shares with the practice of short selling , in which they borrow shares that are immediately sold in expectation of being able to repurchase them later at a cheaper price before they must be returned to the original owner .
if that were the case , funds could also be buying heavily to make sure they can return the vw stock without suffering even heavier losses .
" people must unwind short positions because they are losing money , " baader bank strategist robert halver told reporters .
but in the end , even market specialists say that " no one knows who is holding the positions , who the speculative funds might be , who is buying or selling for porsche , " in the words of bhf-bank analyst albrecht denninghoff .
" we do not know how many people are on board the ship .
" there is no transparency in the markets .
at that point , anything is possible . "
halver goes even further , saying that even funds caught short trying to profit from short selling would not fully explain vw 's soaring share price .
" it is just not possible , " he said .
" bafin should open an investigation , " halver added in reference to germany 's financial market regulator .
a spokeswoman for the market watchdog told the afp news agency it is examining the data .
“ it is not a formal investigation , " she added . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .
production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .
as the deadline for porsche 's takeover approaches , those banks must make sure they own the shares in question .
brokers have said banks probably waited until the last minute in a bet that vw shares would fall because of the financial crisis and might be scrambling now to cover their positions .
mystery surrounds investors another hypothesis is that speculative investment funds may have targeted vw shares with the practice of short selling , in which they borrow shares that are immediately sold in expectation of being able to repurchase them later at a cheaper price before they must be returned to the original owner .
if that were the case , funds could also be buying heavily to make sure they can return the vw stock without suffering even heavier losses .
" people must unwind short positions because they are losing money , " baader bank strategist robert halver told reporters .
but in the end , even market specialists say that " no one knows who is holding the positions , who the speculative funds might be , who is buying or selling for porsche , " in the words of bhf-bank analyst albrecht denninghoff .
" we do not know how many people are on board the ship .
" there is no transparency in the markets .
at that point , anything is possible . "
halver goes even further , saying that even funds caught short trying to profit from short selling would not fully explain vw 's soaring share price .

vw , however , bucked the downward trend and set record highs for its shares on the stock market . following announcements by nissan , renault , and volvo in europe , and restructuring by general motors and ford , utility vehicles are also unveiling hits from slumping sales .
in the united states , the market deteriorated " in a way we have not anticipated , " daimler trucks boss andreas renschler told a telephone press conference .
he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .
" as the recession deepens , the heavy-truck market is hit harder , " german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer told reporters .
" the sector will see a recession as well . "
in addition , a daimler spokeswoman told reporters , the sector is subject to regular cycles , and the german group had already expected diminished demand late this year and early in 2009 .

in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .
as the deadline for porsche 's takeover approaches , those banks must make sure they own the shares in question .
brokers have said banks probably waited until the last minute in a bet that vw shares would fall because of the financial crisis and might be scrambling now to cover their positions .
mystery surrounds investors another hypothesis is that speculative investment funds may have targeted vw shares with the practice of short selling , in which they borrow shares that are immediately sold in expectation of being able to repurchase them later at a cheaper price before they must be returned to the original owner .
if that were the case , funds could also be buying heavily to make sure they can return the vw stock without suffering even heavier losses .
" people must unwind short positions because they are losing money , " baader bank strategist robert halver told reporters .
but in the end , even market specialists say that " no one knows who is holding the positions , who the speculative funds might be , who is buying or selling for porsche , " in the words of bhf-bank analyst albrecht denninghoff .
" we do not know how many people are on board the ship .
" there is no transparency in the markets .

halver goes even further , saying that even funds caught short trying to profit from short selling would not fully explain vw 's soaring share price .

vw , however , bucked the downward trend and set record highs for its shares on the stock market . following announcements by nissan , renault , and volvo in europe , and restructuring by general motors and ford , utility vehicles are also unveiling hits from slumping sales .
in the united states , the market deteriorated " in a way we have not anticipated , " daimler trucks boss andreas renschler told a telephone press conference .
he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .
" as the recession deepens , the heavy-truck market is hit harder , " german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer told reporters .
" the sector will see a recession as well . "
in addition , a daimler spokeswoman told reporters , the sector is subject to regular cycles , and the german group had already expected diminished demand late this year and early in 2009 .
" it is falling back more sharply now , " she noted however .
finally , new us regulations aimed at reducing pollution have also hurt sales , daimler said .
the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 14.10.2008 eu set for " crisis management " summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of financial recovery is expected to dominate the summit eu leaders meeting in brussels this week have lots on their plate with a financial crisis raging , soured relations with russia , and questions about the bloc 's future after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty . at the top of the agenda in brussels will be the issue of how the eu can work to restore confidence in financial markets traumatized by the worst declines in almost 80 years .
ahead of the summit , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that europe and the rest of the world must rethink financial regulation and supervisory rules , including for hedge funds and private equity , once the crisis subsides .
he said he was encouraged by stock market surges following sunday 's adoption of a coordinated 2.2 trillion euro -lrb- $ 3,023 billion -rrb- rescue plan for banks in eurozone countries .
" once we have put financial markets back on their feet , we must ensure that in the future , they function properly for the benefit of citizens and businesses , rather than themselves , " barroso said .
german news agency dpa has reported that diplomats expect the eu summit to throw its weight behind the euro-group decision rather than proposing new measures .
mending ties with russia the second crisis on the eu 's agenda ?
whether or not it should re-open talks with russia on a key strategic partnership which were frozen in the wake of the summer 's russian-georgian war .
at an emergency summit on sept .
1 , leaders agreed there would be no further talks " until troops have withdrawn to the positions held prior to aug .
7 , " the day that fighting began .
russia withdrew from " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia on oct .
9 , but has more than doubled its troop presence in the regions , occupying formerly georgian-held positions there .
this has left eu states at odds over whether conditions for restarting the talks have been fulfilled .
" for me , it 's clear that we have to start the negotiations because the spirit of the agreement has been fulfilled , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
but swedish foreign minister carl bildt disagreed .
" if you look at the maps , -lrb- the russians -rrb- are not back to the positions they held prior to aug .
7 , " he said .
ireland to report on lisbon treaty finally , the summit is set to hear a report from the irish government on the country 's rejection of the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 .
the " no " vote threw the bloc into institutional panic as the treaty can not come into effect without being ratified by every member .

but in ireland , many voters reported feeling confused and poorly informed about the consequences of the referendum .
there were fears that voting " yes " to the treaty would lead to ireland 's arm being twisted on such sensitive issues as military neutrality and abortion rights .
ahead of the summit , european commission vice president margot wallstroem told the irish times that she has warned member states not to push ireland into a decision about whether to hold a second referendum .
" the irish should not be forced or pushed or pressed into taking a decision that they do n't feel ready for , " she said .
she added that rumors that eu politicians would move ahead without ireland were " unrealistic . "

he said he was encouraged by stock market surges following sunday 's adoption of a coordinated 2.2 trillion euro -lrb- $ 3,023 billion -rrb- rescue plan for banks in eurozone countries .
" once we have put financial markets back on their feet , we must ensure that in the future , they function properly for the benefit of citizens and businesses , rather than themselves , " barroso said .
german news agency dpa has reported that diplomats expect the eu summit to throw its weight behind the euro-group decision rather than proposing new measures .
mending ties with russia the second crisis on the eu 's agenda ?
whether or not it should re-open talks with russia on a key strategic partnership which were frozen in the wake of the summer 's russian-georgian war .
at an emergency summit on sept .
1 , leaders agreed there would be no further talks " until troops have withdrawn to the positions held prior to aug .
7 , " the day that fighting began .
russia withdrew from " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia on oct .
9 , but has more than doubled its troop presence in the regions , occupying formerly georgian-held positions there .
this has left eu states at odds over whether conditions for restarting the talks have been fulfilled .
" for me , it 's clear that we have to start the negotiations because the spirit of the agreement has been fulfilled , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
but swedish foreign minister carl bildt disagreed .
" if you look at the maps , -lrb- the russians -rrb- are not back to the positions they held prior to aug .
7 , " he said .
ireland to report on lisbon treaty finally , the summit is set to hear a report from the irish government on the country 's rejection of the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 .
the " no " vote threw the bloc into institutional panic as the treaty can not come into effect without being ratified by every member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit will give ireland another chance to express itself the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the eu 's institutions and increase efficiency and transparency to voters .
but in ireland , many voters reported feeling confused and poorly informed about the consequences of the referendum .
there were fears that voting " yes " to the treaty would lead to ireland 's arm being twisted on such sensitive issues as military neutrality and abortion rights .
ahead of the summit , european commission vice president margot wallstroem told the irish times that she has warned member states not to push ireland into a decision about whether to hold a second referendum .
" the irish should not be forced or pushed or pressed into taking a decision that they do n't feel ready for , " she said .
she added that rumors that eu politicians would move ahead without ireland were " unrealistic . "
" there might be those who will want to go ahead on their own , but i think it is totally unrealistic , " wallstroem said .
" nobody wants to see ireland out of the eu and that is certainly not the wish of the irish people . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german photographer and an artist won lawsuits against google for displaying thumbnails of their works in search results without permission .
google will reportedly appeal the ruling . google can not display copyrighted works as thumbnails without an owner 's permission , a court in the northern german city of hamburg ruled on tuesday , oct 14 .
since the photos in google image search are displayed as thumbnails , no new work is created , which leaves no justification for displaying the copywrited works without permission , the court ruled .
" it does n't matter that thumbnails are much smaller than original pictures and are displayed in a lower resolution , " the court said in its ruling .
artists complain google 's image search function brings up often millions of thumbnails of photographs , pictures and other graphics culled from internet sites .
google always has a disclaimed next to images that they might be scaled down and also might be subject to copyright .
but for some that is not enough .
they do not want their images to show up in the search engine at all .
german photographer michael bernhard and artist thomas horn brought cases against google in germany to protest the display of their copyrighted images .
horn , whose comic drawings were displayed on google , has reportedly asked for about 1,300 euros plus interest to compensate for his " stolen pictures . "
google likely to appeal if the ruling ends up keeping all copyrighted images from being displayed in google , that " capitulates us into the digital stone age , " kay oberbeck , spokeswoman for google germany was quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper as saying .
google will appeal the ruling , the newspaper reported .
but if it is upheld , it could mean that google would have to turn off its image search function , the hamburger abendblatt reported .

a german photographer and an artist won lawsuits against google for displaying thumbnails of their works in search results without permission .
google will reportedly appeal the ruling . google can not display copyrighted works as thumbnails without an owner 's permission , a court in the northern german city of hamburg ruled on tuesday , oct 14 .
since the photos in google image search are displayed as thumbnails , no new work is created , which leaves no justification for displaying the copywrited works without permission , the court ruled .
" it does n't matter that thumbnails are much smaller than original pictures and are displayed in a lower resolution , " the court said in its ruling .
artists complain google 's image search function brings up often millions of thumbnails of photographs , pictures and other graphics culled from internet sites .
google always has a disclaimed next to images that they might be scaled down and also might be subject to copyright .
but for some that is not enough .
they do not want their images to show up in the search engine at all .
german photographer michael bernhard and artist thomas horn brought cases against google in germany to protest the display of their copyrighted images .
horn , whose comic drawings were displayed on google , has reportedly asked for about 1,300 euros plus interest to compensate for his " stolen pictures . "
google likely to appeal if the ruling ends up keeping all copyrighted images from being displayed in google , that " capitulates us into the digital stone age , " kay oberbeck , spokeswoman for google germany was quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper as saying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.10.2008 europe 's bank rescue signals end of era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european stock markets rebounded after the bailouts were announced big changes are in store for european banks after the latest round of bailouts were announced .
in the long term , it could mean more eu-wide regulation . recent days have seen european governments galloping to the rescue of struggling banks , approving mergers and announcing billion-euro bailouts .
in the process , they 've threatened to ride roughshod over the european union 's strict limits on state aid to the private sector .
that is the view of neelie kroes , the commissioner in charge of competition for the eu , who used the wild west analogy in a sharply-worded speech in brussels on monday , oct .
13 .
an anything-goes atmosphere would be a “ recipe for chaos , ” kroes warned .
yet it ’ s unlikely that europe ’ s financial crisis will turn into a spaghetti western .
in the long run , the banking crisis will likely mean more unity in europe ’ s financial sector , say leading economists and eu banking experts .
in crisis mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current crisis has been likened to the wild west the top priority for eu leaders in recent days has been to unfreeze the credit markets .
all other concerns have taken a back seat .
more than a half dozen european countries announced bailout plans monday , with germany alone putting together a rescue package worth as much as 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 671 billion -rrb- .
“ the agenda is dominated by crisis management .
everything is suspended until we 're out of the crisis , ” iain begg , an expert on eu policies and fiscal issues at the london school of economics , told deutsche welle .
yet after the immediate crisis stabilizes , europe will need to take a broader look at its banking sector .
improving competition and regulation were issues before the crisis and now have become even more so , begg and others said .
finding a solution even as european governments announced 1.4 trillion euros in guarantees and other emergency measures , they stopped short of a one-size-fits-all bailout .
specific actions were left up to individual countries and no europe-wide fund has been established to help other countries ' troubled banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are calls for large banks to be regulated differently still , that level of unity was remarkable for the euro area , said nicolas veron of bruegel , a european think tank devoted to international economics . “ what is sure is that the europeans have reacted quickly to the crisis and that was not a foregone conclusion , ” veron told deutsche welle .
european markets reacted positively , jumping 9 percent on monday.the hope is that government guarantees will help banks overcome their reluctance to lend money to one another .
opening up competition yet veron cautioned against the idea that the road ahead would be easy .
“ what was announced yesterday will not magically solve all the problems , ” veron said .
“ the implementation will be very difficult . ”
a few hours after offering up her wild west criticism , kroes made public rules for eu member states to follow when rescuing banks .
all banks which operate in a country have to be covered by guarantees , kroes said .
this is an implied criticism of ireland , which on sept .
30 proposed covering only deposits in irish-owned banks .
the government has since revised the proposal to include non-irish banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has promised 500 billion euros “ we 've had problems with competition in europe for a long time .
most european bank markets are heavily dominated by national firms , ” said fredrik erixon , the director of the european center for international political economy -lrb- ecipe -rrb- , a think tank dedicated to trade and other international issues of importance to europe . yet multinational banks pose their own set of problems , erixon and others point out .
who would pick up the bill for bailing out the british subsidiary , say , of spain 's banco santander ?
or who would come to the rescue of the spanish arm of deutsche bank ? and would it be enough to tighten regulations on european banks ?
erixon said the worry is that people would then shift investments to asia and the us where regulations did n't exist . economists just do n't know exactly what the upcoming days and months will bring . “ we are still in the phase of crisis reaction , ” erixon said .

in the long term , it could mean more eu-wide regulation . recent days have seen european governments galloping to the rescue of struggling banks , approving mergers and announcing billion-euro bailouts .
in the process , they 've threatened to ride roughshod over the european union 's strict limits on state aid to the private sector .
that is the view of neelie kroes , the commissioner in charge of competition for the eu , who used the wild west analogy in a sharply-worded speech in brussels on monday , oct .

an anything-goes atmosphere would be a “ recipe for chaos , ” kroes warned .
yet it ’ s unlikely that europe ’ s financial crisis will turn into a spaghetti western .
in the long run , the banking crisis will likely mean more unity in europe ’ s financial sector , say leading economists and eu banking experts .
in crisis mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current crisis has been likened to the wild west the top priority for eu leaders in recent days has been to unfreeze the credit markets .
all other concerns have taken a back seat .
more than a half dozen european countries announced bailout plans monday , with germany alone putting together a rescue package worth as much as 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 671 billion -rrb- .
“ the agenda is dominated by crisis management .
everything is suspended until we 're out of the crisis , ” iain begg , an expert on eu policies and fiscal issues at the london school of economics , told deutsche welle .

finding a solution even as european governments announced 1.4 trillion euros in guarantees and other emergency measures , they stopped short of a one-size-fits-all bailout .
specific actions were left up to individual countries and no europe-wide fund has been established to help other countries ' troubled banks .

european markets reacted positively , jumping 9 percent on monday.the hope is that government guarantees will help banks overcome their reluctance to lend money to one another .
opening up competition yet veron cautioned against the idea that the road ahead would be easy .
“ what was announced yesterday will not magically solve all the problems , ” veron said .
“ the implementation will be very difficult . ”
a few hours after offering up her wild west criticism , kroes made public rules for eu member states to follow when rescuing banks .
all banks which operate in a country have to be covered by guarantees , kroes said .
this is an implied criticism of ireland , which on sept .

most european bank markets are heavily dominated by national firms , ” said fredrik erixon , the director of the european center for international political economy -lrb- ecipe -rrb- , a think tank dedicated to trade and other international issues of importance to europe . yet multinational banks pose their own set of problems , erixon and others point out .

russian troops have withdrawn from the zones adjacent to -lrb- the georgian breakaway regions of -rrb- south ossetia and abkhazia , " a joint statement said .
however , while the move is " an essential additional step " in the implementation of an eu-sponsored peace plan , the ministers " called on the parties to implement their commitments , " including by giving access to eu and un observers , the statement said .
the decision dashes the hopes of those eu member states which had said that russia 's withdrawal from the so-called " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions was enough for the bloc to re-open talks on a wide-ranging strategic deal .
ahead of the meeting , germany and italy stressed that it was " in the eu 's interest " to re-open talks on a successor to the current eu-russia partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many russian troops have pulled out but some remain german deputy foreign minister guenter gloser said , " there will always be some people who think the eu is doing russia a favor " with the negotiations .

and the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , proposed that ministers respond to russia 's pull-out by agreeing to re-launch talks in november .

those problems dominated talks , with ministers agreeing to make no move until they see how events unfold on the ground in georgia and how russia behaves in international talks on the crisis , set to open in geneva on wednesday .
" in due course we can address the pca -lrb- successor -rrb- , " british foreign minister david miliband said , " but at the moment we should be focusing on ensuring that all the elements that were agreed in september , including the geneva talks , get going with proper speed . "

ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .
i have n't been able to find one .
in all my years at fc bayern munich , in my entire soccer career , i ca n't remember having such a bad start in the season .
so many people are preoccupied with finding an explanation for this -lrb- pile of successive defeats -rrb- .
my take on it is that the situation is so complex that no explanation is necessary .
we must simply work harder to reach our goal : to be at the top of the league .
what are you thinking when you look at the scoreboard and fc bayern munich is in llth place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .
this season the team has shown in a rudimentary way that it understands klinsmann 's working philosophy - in playing against cologne , against nuremburg or in the second half of the champions league playoffs against lyon .
what we 're missing is consistency and a good balance .
but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?
bildunterschrift : " now is not the time to whine and look for explanations .
the season begins anew ... "
we do n't have much time .
hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- is in the lead by seven points .
the experimental phase is over .
i 'm not the only one who knows that .
our coach knows that too .
now is not the time to keep whining or look for explanations .
we need to get our act together for upcoming games .
the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .
second , even if i had talked to fc bayern or another club about commitments starting 2009 , i would give them all the same answer : this is not the right time to discuss such matters .
i 'm only going to start thinking about my future starting in february or march of next year .
at the moment , i 'm fully focused on the current season .
third of all , a final decision of where to go or stay would be made in conjunction with my whole family .
regardless of what the future holds , my wife , my kids and i feel very much at home in munich .
fans of fc bayern munich would perhaps want to see more of you , the ze roberto , who grows better with age .
meanwhile i almost believe in my old motto .
i recently said that i 'm like a good old bottle of wine : with age , i always get better .
that seems to be the case right now . daniel martinez -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .
i have n't been able to find one .
in all my years at fc bayern munich , in my entire soccer career , i ca n't remember having such a bad start in the season .
so many people are preoccupied with finding an explanation for this -lrb- pile of successive defeats -rrb- .
my take on it is that the situation is so complex that no explanation is necessary .
we must simply work harder to reach our goal : to be at the top of the league .
what are you thinking when you look at the scoreboard and fc bayern munich is in llth place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .
this season the team has shown in a rudimentary way that it understands klinsmann 's working philosophy - in playing against cologne , against nuremburg or in the second half of the champions league playoffs against lyon .
what we 're missing is consistency and a good balance .
but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?
bildunterschrift : " now is not the time to whine and look for explanations .
the season begins anew ... "
we do n't have much time .
hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- is in the lead by seven points .
the experimental phase is over .
i 'm not the only one who knows that .
our coach knows that too .
now is not the time to keep whining or look for explanations .
we need to get our act together for upcoming games .
the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .
second , even if i had talked to fc bayern or another club about commitments starting 2009 , i would give them all the same answer : this is not the right time to discuss such matters .
i 'm only going to start thinking about my future starting in february or march of next year .
at the moment , i 'm fully focused on the current season .
third of all , a final decision of where to go or stay would be made in conjunction with my whole family .
regardless of what the future holds , my wife , my kids and i feel very much at home in munich .
fans of fc bayern munich would perhaps want to see more of you , the ze roberto , who grows better with age .
meanwhile i almost believe in my old motto .
i recently said that i 'm like a good old bottle of wine : with age , i always get better .

president of the european union hans-gert pottering , who also serves as president-in-office of empa , called for speedy solutions to two issues that hinder the peace negotiations : " the expansion of settlements , which is undermining the palestinians ' confidence " in the peace process , and " the extremely restricted freedom of movement of palestinians , " which has hindered investment in the palestinian economy and prevented economic recovery .
worries of fading interest given that empa countries provide 60 percent of all aid to the palestinians , pottering warned of the need to prevent donors being overcome by " a certain fatigue , or lack of interest in the fate of the palestinians . "
he said that it was " unacceptable that the fruits of financial solidarity should be wiped out as a result of military operations or for security reasons , however legitimate they may be . "
the empa meeting asked euro-med foreign ministers to officially recognize empa as the " democratically legitimized parliamentary institution " of the union for the mediterranean , which was launched in july in paris by french president nicolas sarkozy . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tellkamp 's nearly 1,000-page tome is about the disintegration of former east germany , leading to the collapse of the communist regime in 1989 .
the semi-autobiographical saga spans three generations of a of an elite group of dresden intellectuals and artists living in an ivory tower high above the baroque city that was once called the florence of the elbe and demolished by allied bombs at the end of the war .

he is due to meet his chinese counterpart hu jintao and also hold talks with premier wen jiabao and other top officials .
in an interview with chinese official xinhua news agency , zardari hailed china as the world ’ s future and said that building economic ties would be his top priority .
the two sides are expected to sign a number of agreements in areas ranging from the economy , energy , and space technology to the environment . pakistan and china have been close allies for decades .
but with president zardari ’ s maiden trip to china , pakistan wants to take bilateral ties to “ new heights ” .
yiyi lu , an expert on chinese affairs at the london-based chatham house think tank says the two countries are very significant for each other strategically : “ pakistan is china ’ s long-term ally in south asia and china can count on pakistan ’ s support for its policies internationally . ”
“ in pakistan , there have been many changes in leadership but , with every new government , its friendly policy towards china has continued .
i think both countries know that their friendship is consistent and that they can rely on each other in difficult times . ”
looking east for support in tough times at present , pakistan is facing extremely tough times .
its relations with the us are on the rocks - tensions have simmered in recent weeks as us forces based in afghanistan have carried out a series of cross border raids on pakistan ’ s tribal areas , which are considered safe havens for taliban and al-qaeda militants .
moreover , its economy , which was already suffering because of political instability and rising violence , has also been hit by the ongoing global financial crisis .
some economists fear pakistan could go bankrupt by early next year .
in this hour of need , islamabad is looking east for financial help .
during his trip to china , zardari will hold direct talks with the heads of chinese financial institutions and executives from the corporate sector .
high expectations from beijing hasan askari rizvi , a political analyst from lahore , says that pakistan has high expectations from beijing .
“ during this trip , the two sides are expected to discuss issues , which concern pakistan , such as power generation , where china has helped pakistan before , and also the financial crisis .
expectations are that china will offer pakistan co-operation in investment or provide a long-term financial security plan . ”
but experts don ’ t think china alone can completely bail out pakistan .
“ obviously china won ’ t be able to help pakistan single-handedly but it can offer some help as it has done in the past - e.g. with a trade agreement , loans and investment , ” said yiyi lu .
china has boosted its investment in pakistan in recent years .
bilateral annual trade between the two countries is currently worth more than 5 billion euros .
china is pakistan ’ s biggest arms supplier and the two sides have also been co-operating for years in the area of nuclear power .
possible civil nuclear deal now , there is speculation that they might negotiate civil nuclear deal during zardari 's trip although there has been no official confirmation from either side .
“ china will be careful about exactly what a civil nuclear deal with pakistan involves - because it will be under international scrutiny .
countries such as india , which is developing a similar technology , will be watching closely .
at the same time , china does want to go ahead with the cooperation with pakistan as long as it is committed to international guidelines . ”
president zardari is also expected to discuss the issue of terrorism with china ’ s leaders .
he told china ’ s official xinhua news agency that the two countries were keen on carrying out closer cooperation to combat it .
china , for its part , will likely raise the issue of the fate of two chinese engineers , who were kidnapped by pakistani taliban militants near the afghan border six weeks ago . disha uppal 14/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

in the long term , it could mean more eu-wide regulation . recent days have seen european governments galloping to the rescue of struggling banks , approving mergers and announcing billion-euro bailouts .
in the process , they 've threatened to ride roughshod over the european union 's strict limits on state aid to the private sector .
that is the view of neelie kroes , the commissioner in charge of competition for the eu , who used the wild west analogy in a sharply-worded speech in brussels on monday , oct .
13 .
an anything-goes atmosphere would be a “ recipe for chaos , ” kroes warned .
yet it ’ s unlikely that europe ’ s financial crisis will turn into a spaghetti western .
in the long run , the banking crisis will likely mean more unity in europe ’ s financial sector , say leading economists and eu banking experts .
in crisis mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current crisis has been likened to the wild west the top priority for eu leaders in recent days has been to unfreeze the credit markets .
all other concerns have taken a back seat .
more than a half dozen european countries announced bailout plans monday , with germany alone putting together a rescue package worth as much as 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 671 billion -rrb- .
“ the agenda is dominated by crisis management .
everything is suspended until we 're out of the crisis , ” iain begg , an expert on eu policies and fiscal issues at the london school of economics , told deutsche welle .
yet after the immediate crisis stabilizes , europe will need to take a broader look at its banking sector .
improving competition and regulation were issues before the crisis and now have become even more so , begg and others said .
finding a solution even as european governments announced 1.4 trillion euros in guarantees and other emergency measures , they stopped short of a one-size-fits-all bailout .
specific actions were left up to individual countries and no europe-wide fund has been established to help other countries ' troubled banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are calls for large banks to be regulated differently still , that level of unity was remarkable for the euro area , said nicolas veron of bruegel , a european think tank devoted to international economics . “ what is sure is that the europeans have reacted quickly to the crisis and that was not a foregone conclusion , ” veron told deutsche welle .
european markets reacted positively , jumping 9 percent on monday.the hope is that government guarantees will help banks overcome their reluctance to lend money to one another .
opening up competition yet veron cautioned against the idea that the road ahead would be easy .
“ what was announced yesterday will not magically solve all the problems , ” veron said .
“ the implementation will be very difficult . ”
a few hours after offering up her wild west criticism , kroes made public rules for eu member states to follow when rescuing banks .
all banks which operate in a country have to be covered by guarantees , kroes said .
this is an implied criticism of ireland , which on sept .
30 proposed covering only deposits in irish-owned banks .
the government has since revised the proposal to include non-irish banks .

mp3 players and mobile phones cranked up to high volumes are the main culprits , a study by european scientists shows . any more than five hours of loud music through headphones has the potential to cause permanent hearing loss , according to a study done for the european commission , the european union 's executive arm .
the study said that children and teenagers need to be protected from " leisure noise . "
loud mobile phones were also criticized .
" there has been increasing concern about exposure from the new generation of personal music players which can reproduce sounds at very high volumes without loss of quality , " the commission said in a statement .
young people pose special risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stop the noise !
experts estimated that between 50 and 100 million europeans listen to portable music players on a daily basis .
if those players are cranked up to more than 89 decibels for five hours a week , the resulting noise would exceed eu limits for workplace noise .
if listened to for longer periods , hearing damage is a concern .
between 5 and 10 percent of listeners - 10 million europeans - are in danger of having hearing loss , according to the study .
" i am concerned that so many young people ... who are frequent users of personal music players and mobile phones at high acoustic levels , may be unknowingly damaging their hearing irrevocably , " meglena kuneva , the eu 's consumer affairs commissioner , said in the statement . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision dashes the hopes of those eu member states which had said that russia 's withdrawal from the so-called " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions was enough for the bloc to re-open talks on a wide-ranging strategic deal .

president of the european union hans-gert pottering , who also serves as president-in-office of empa , called for speedy solutions to two issues that hinder the peace negotiations : " the expansion of settlements , which is undermining the palestinians ' confidence " in the peace process , and " the extremely restricted freedom of movement of palestinians , " which has hindered investment in the palestinian economy and prevented economic recovery .
worries of fading interest given that empa countries provide 60 percent of all aid to the palestinians , pottering warned of the need to prevent donors being overcome by " a certain fatigue , or lack of interest in the fate of the palestinians . "
he said that it was " unacceptable that the fruits of financial solidarity should be wiped out as a result of military operations or for security reasons , however legitimate they may be . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.10.2008 europe 's bank rescue signals end of era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european stock markets rebounded after the bailouts were announced big changes are in store for european banks after the latest round of bailouts were announced .
in the long term , it could mean more eu-wide regulation . recent days have seen european governments galloping to the rescue of struggling banks , approving mergers and announcing billion-euro bailouts .
in the process , they 've threatened to ride roughshod over the european union 's strict limits on state aid to the private sector .
that is the view of neelie kroes , the commissioner in charge of competition for the eu , who used the wild west analogy in a sharply-worded speech in brussels on monday , oct .
13 .
an anything-goes atmosphere would be a “ recipe for chaos , ” kroes warned .
yet it ’ s unlikely that europe ’ s financial crisis will turn into a spaghetti western .
in the long run , the banking crisis will likely mean more unity in europe ’ s financial sector , say leading economists and eu banking experts .
in crisis mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current crisis has been likened to the wild west the top priority for eu leaders in recent days has been to unfreeze the credit markets .
all other concerns have taken a back seat .
more than a half dozen european countries announced bailout plans monday , with germany alone putting together a rescue package worth as much as 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 671 billion -rrb- .
“ the agenda is dominated by crisis management .
everything is suspended until we 're out of the crisis , ” iain begg , an expert on eu policies and fiscal issues at the london school of economics , told deutsche welle .
yet after the immediate crisis stabilizes , europe will need to take a broader look at its banking sector .
improving competition and regulation were issues before the crisis and now have become even more so , begg and others said .
finding a solution even as european governments announced 1.4 trillion euros in guarantees and other emergency measures , they stopped short of a one-size-fits-all bailout .
specific actions were left up to individual countries and no europe-wide fund has been established to help other countries ' troubled banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are calls for large banks to be regulated differently still , that level of unity was remarkable for the euro area , said nicolas veron of bruegel , a european think tank devoted to international economics . “ what is sure is that the europeans have reacted quickly to the crisis and that was not a foregone conclusion , ” veron told deutsche welle .
european markets reacted positively , jumping 9 percent on monday.the hope is that government guarantees will help banks overcome their reluctance to lend money to one another .
opening up competition yet veron cautioned against the idea that the road ahead would be easy .
“ what was announced yesterday will not magically solve all the problems , ” veron said .
“ the implementation will be very difficult . ”
a few hours after offering up her wild west criticism , kroes made public rules for eu member states to follow when rescuing banks .
all banks which operate in a country have to be covered by guarantees , kroes said .
this is an implied criticism of ireland , which on sept .
30 proposed covering only deposits in irish-owned banks .

ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .
i have n't been able to find one .
in all my years at fc bayern munich , in my entire soccer career , i ca n't remember having such a bad start in the season .
so many people are preoccupied with finding an explanation for this -lrb- pile of successive defeats -rrb- .
my take on it is that the situation is so complex that no explanation is necessary .
we must simply work harder to reach our goal : to be at the top of the league .
what are you thinking when you look at the scoreboard and fc bayern munich is in llth place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .
this season the team has shown in a rudimentary way that it understands klinsmann 's working philosophy - in playing against cologne , against nuremburg or in the second half of the champions league playoffs against lyon .
what we 're missing is consistency and a good balance .
but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?
bildunterschrift : " now is not the time to whine and look for explanations .
the season begins anew ... "
we do n't have much time .
hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- is in the lead by seven points .
the experimental phase is over .
i 'm not the only one who knows that .
our coach knows that too .
now is not the time to keep whining or look for explanations .
we need to get our act together for upcoming games .
the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .
second , even if i had talked to fc bayern or another club about commitments starting 2009 , i would give them all the same answer : this is not the right time to discuss such matters .
i 'm only going to start thinking about my future starting in february or march of next year .
at the moment , i 'm fully focused on the current season .
third of all , a final decision of where to go or stay would be made in conjunction with my whole family .
regardless of what the future holds , my wife , my kids and i feel very much at home in munich .
fans of fc bayern munich would perhaps want to see more of you , the ze roberto , who grows better with age .
meanwhile i almost believe in my old motto .
i recently said that i 'm like a good old bottle of wine : with age , i always get better .
that seems to be the case right now . daniel martinez -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are calls for large banks to be regulated differently still , that level of unity was remarkable for the euro area , said nicolas veron of bruegel , a european think tank devoted to international economics . “ what is sure is that the europeans have reacted quickly to the crisis and that was not a foregone conclusion , ” veron told deutsche welle .
european markets reacted positively , jumping 9 percent on monday.the hope is that government guarantees will help banks overcome their reluctance to lend money to one another .
opening up competition yet veron cautioned against the idea that the road ahead would be easy .
“ what was announced yesterday will not magically solve all the problems , ” veron said .
“ the implementation will be very difficult . ”
a few hours after offering up her wild west criticism , kroes made public rules for eu member states to follow when rescuing banks .
all banks which operate in a country have to be covered by guarantees , kroes said .
this is an implied criticism of ireland , which on sept .
30 proposed covering only deposits in irish-owned banks .
the government has since revised the proposal to include non-irish banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has promised 500 billion euros “ we 've had problems with competition in europe for a long time .
most european bank markets are heavily dominated by national firms , ” said fredrik erixon , the director of the european center for international political economy -lrb- ecipe -rrb- , a think tank dedicated to trade and other international issues of importance to europe . yet multinational banks pose their own set of problems , erixon and others point out .
who would pick up the bill for bailing out the british subsidiary , say , of spain 's banco santander ?
or who would come to the rescue of the spanish arm of deutsche bank ? and would it be enough to tighten regulations on european banks ?
erixon said the worry is that people would then shift investments to asia and the us where regulations did n't exist . economists just do n't know exactly what the upcoming days and months will bring . “ we are still in the phase of crisis reaction , ” erixon said .

ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .
i have n't been able to find one .
in all my years at fc bayern munich , in my entire soccer career , i ca n't remember having such a bad start in the season .
so many people are preoccupied with finding an explanation for this -lrb- pile of successive defeats -rrb- .
my take on it is that the situation is so complex that no explanation is necessary .
we must simply work harder to reach our goal : to be at the top of the league .
what are you thinking when you look at the scoreboard and fc bayern munich is in llth place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .
this season the team has shown in a rudimentary way that it understands klinsmann 's working philosophy - in playing against cologne , against nuremburg or in the second half of the champions league playoffs against lyon .
what we 're missing is consistency and a good balance .
but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?
bildunterschrift : " now is not the time to whine and look for explanations .
the season begins anew ... "
we do n't have much time .
hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- is in the lead by seven points .
the experimental phase is over .
i 'm not the only one who knows that .
our coach knows that too .
now is not the time to keep whining or look for explanations .
we need to get our act together for upcoming games .
the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .
second , even if i had talked to fc bayern or another club about commitments starting 2009 , i would give them all the same answer : this is not the right time to discuss such matters .
i 'm only going to start thinking about my future starting in february or march of next year .
at the moment , i 'm fully focused on the current season .
third of all , a final decision of where to go or stay would be made in conjunction with my whole family .
regardless of what the future holds , my wife , my kids and i feel very much at home in munich .
fans of fc bayern munich would perhaps want to see more of you , the ze roberto , who grows better with age .
meanwhile i almost believe in my old motto .
i recently said that i 'm like a good old bottle of wine : with age , i always get better .

a german photographer and an artist won lawsuits against google for displaying thumbnails of their works in search results without permission .
google will reportedly appeal the ruling . google can not display copyrighted works as thumbnails without an owner 's permission , a court in the northern german city of hamburg ruled on tuesday , oct 14 .
since the photos in google image search are displayed as thumbnails , no new work is created , which leaves no justification for displaying the copywrited works without permission , the court ruled .
" it does n't matter that thumbnails are much smaller than original pictures and are displayed in a lower resolution , " the court said in its ruling .
artists complain google 's image search function brings up often millions of thumbnails of photographs , pictures and other graphics culled from internet sites .
google always has a disclaimed next to images that they might be scaled down and also might be subject to copyright .
but for some that is not enough .
they do not want their images to show up in the search engine at all .
german photographer michael bernhard and artist thomas horn brought cases against google in germany to protest the display of their copyrighted images .
horn , whose comic drawings were displayed on google , has reportedly asked for about 1,300 euros plus interest to compensate for his " stolen pictures . "
google likely to appeal if the ruling ends up keeping all copyrighted images from being displayed in google , that " capitulates us into the digital stone age , " kay oberbeck , spokeswoman for google germany was quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper as saying .
google will appeal the ruling , the newspaper reported .
but if it is upheld , it could mean that google would have to turn off its image search function , the hamburger abendblatt reported .
the court suggested that google replace thumbnails of pictures with a text describing them , something google said is not a practical , user-friendly solution . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , at the dead sea resort in amman by urging continuation of peace talks between israel and palestine .
president of the european union hans-gert pottering , who also serves as president-in-office of empa , called for speedy solutions to two issues that hinder the peace negotiations : " the expansion of settlements , which is undermining the palestinians ' confidence " in the peace process , and " the extremely restricted freedom of movement of palestinians , " which has hindered investment in the palestinian economy and prevented economic recovery .
worries of fading interest given that empa countries provide 60 percent of all aid to the palestinians , pottering warned of the need to prevent donors being overcome by " a certain fatigue , or lack of interest in the fate of the palestinians . "
he said that it was " unacceptable that the fruits of financial solidarity should be wiped out as a result of military operations or for security reasons , however legitimate they may be . "
the empa meeting asked euro-med foreign ministers to officially recognize empa as the " democratically legitimized parliamentary institution " of the union for the mediterranean , which was launched in july in paris by french president nicolas sarkozy . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german photographer and an artist won lawsuits against google for displaying thumbnails of their works in search results without permission .
google will reportedly appeal the ruling . google can not display copyrighted works as thumbnails without an owner 's permission , a court in the northern german city of hamburg ruled on tuesday , oct 14 .
since the photos in google image search are displayed as thumbnails , no new work is created , which leaves no justification for displaying the copywrited works without permission , the court ruled .
" it does n't matter that thumbnails are much smaller than original pictures and are displayed in a lower resolution , " the court said in its ruling .
artists complain google 's image search function brings up often millions of thumbnails of photographs , pictures and other graphics culled from internet sites .
google always has a disclaimed next to images that they might be scaled down and also might be subject to copyright .
but for some that is not enough .
they do not want their images to show up in the search engine at all .
german photographer michael bernhard and artist thomas horn brought cases against google in germany to protest the display of their copyrighted images .
horn , whose comic drawings were displayed on google , has reportedly asked for about 1,300 euros plus interest to compensate for his " stolen pictures . "
google likely to appeal if the ruling ends up keeping all copyrighted images from being displayed in google , that " capitulates us into the digital stone age , " kay oberbeck , spokeswoman for google germany was quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper as saying .
google will appeal the ruling , the newspaper reported .
but if it is upheld , it could mean that google would have to turn off its image search function , the hamburger abendblatt reported .
the court suggested that google replace thumbnails of pictures with a text describing them , something google said is not a practical , user-friendly solution . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german book prize recognizes novels with a broad international appeal .
there is a three-step selection process in which a panel of judges select 20 titles , six of which are then short-listed .
tellkamp 's nearly 1,000-page tome is about the disintegration of former east germany , leading to the collapse of the communist regime in 1989 .
the semi-autobiographical saga spans three generations of a of an elite group of dresden intellectuals and artists living in an ivory tower high above the baroque city that was once called the florence of the elbe and demolished by allied bombs at the end of the war .
the main protagonist , who is the son of a doctor and a nurse , rebels against the system as the novel traverses east german literary circles , political institutions , schools and clinics .
author jailed in communist east germany tellkamp , 39 , is a medical doctor who wrote " der turm " between hospital shifts .
he was born in dresden and jailed for his " political unreliability " just before the communist regime dissolved and germany was reunified .
afterwards , tellkamp embarked on his medical studies in newyork and the eastern german city of leipzig before working as a doctor in a dresden clinic .

he also writes poetry and lives in freiburg where he now writes full-time .
book critics were full of praise for " der turm , " but warned that the book is not light reading with its ponderous metaphors and poetic style .
some said he could one day be recognized as a " great german author . "
experiencing history through literature sabine franke of the german daily frankfurter rundschau said that the novel " is not about uncovering facts , but about experiencing history through literature .
this is a book for insiders -lrb- former east germans -rrb- , for those who remember , who were there themselves .

13 , in a ceremony that precludes the frankfurt book fair , the world 's premier publishing event .
the german book prize recognizes novels with a broad international appeal .
there is a three-step selection process in which a panel of judges select 20 titles , six of which are then short-listed .
tellkamp 's nearly 1,000-page tome is about the disintegration of former east germany , leading to the collapse of the communist regime in 1989 .
the semi-autobiographical saga spans three generations of a of an elite group of dresden intellectuals and artists living in an ivory tower high above the baroque city that was once called the florence of the elbe and demolished by allied bombs at the end of the war .
the main protagonist , who is the son of a doctor and a nurse , rebels against the system as the novel traverses east german literary circles , political institutions , schools and clinics .
author jailed in communist east germany tellkamp , 39 , is a medical doctor who wrote " der turm " between hospital shifts .
he was born in dresden and jailed for his " political unreliability " just before the communist regime dissolved and germany was reunified .
afterwards , tellkamp embarked on his medical studies in newyork and the eastern german city of leipzig before working as a doctor in a dresden clinic .
bildunterschrift : the former eastern baroque city of dresden is the backdrop of an epic that spans three generations tellkamp has published one other novel , a thriller called " der eisvogel " -lrb- the kingfisher -rrb- that was hailed by literary critics but had a first run of only 163 copies .
he also writes poetry and lives in freiburg where he now writes full-time .
book critics were full of praise for " der turm , " but warned that the book is not light reading with its ponderous metaphors and poetic style .
some said he could one day be recognized as a " great german author . "
experiencing history through literature sabine franke of the german daily frankfurter rundschau said that the novel " is not about uncovering facts , but about experiencing history through literature .
this is a book for insiders -lrb- former east germans -rrb- , for those who remember , who were there themselves .
but at the same time , it is a book for posterity and parallel worlds , for those who come after and for whom this moment in history can only be contemplated from the outside . "
the five other finalists were dietmar dath for " die abschaffung der arten " -lrb- " the abolition of the species " -rrb- ; sherko fatah for " das dunkle schiff " -lrb- " the dark ship " -rrb- ; iris hanika for " treffen sich zwei " -lrb- " when two meet " -rrb- ; rolf lappert for " nach hause schwimmen " -lrb- " swimming home " -rrb- ; and ingo schulze for " adam und evelyn " -lrb- " adam and evelyn " -rrb- .
tellkamp was awarded 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 dollars -rrb- in prize money and the runners-up were each awarded 2,500 euros .
the german book prize showcases young and upcoming literary talent , launching them on the international scene .

russian negotiators said they would not show up unless the two regions , which russia has recognized as independent nations , had a seat at the table for the talks scheduled for wednesday in the swiss capital .
" without them , we wo n't go to geneva , " deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said in a statement .

" representatives from abkhazia and the so-called south ossetia will not take part in negotiations in geneva , " deputy foreign minister grigol vashadze was quoted by news agency interfax as saying .
moscow flew in the face of western criticism and recognized the two regions as independent after routing a georgian offensive to take back control over south ossetia in august .

mp3 players and mobile phones cranked up to high volumes are the main culprits , a study by european scientists shows . any more than five hours of loud music through headphones has the potential to cause permanent hearing loss , according to a study done for the european commission , the european union 's executive arm .
the study said that children and teenagers need to be protected from " leisure noise . "
loud mobile phones were also criticized .
" there has been increasing concern about exposure from the new generation of personal music players which can reproduce sounds at very high volumes without loss of quality , " the commission said in a statement .
young people pose special risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stop the noise !
experts estimated that between 50 and 100 million europeans listen to portable music players on a daily basis .
if those players are cranked up to more than 89 decibels for five hours a week , the resulting noise would exceed eu limits for workplace noise .
if listened to for longer periods , hearing damage is a concern .
between 5 and 10 percent of listeners - 10 million europeans - are in danger of having hearing loss , according to the study .
" i am concerned that so many young people ... who are frequent users of personal music players and mobile phones at high acoustic levels , may be unknowingly damaging their hearing irrevocably , " meglena kuneva , the eu 's consumer affairs commissioner , said in the statement . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.10.2008 europe 's bank rescue signals end of era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european stock markets rebounded after the bailouts were announced big changes are in store for european banks after the latest round of bailouts were announced .
in the long term , it could mean more eu-wide regulation . recent days have seen european governments galloping to the rescue of struggling banks , approving mergers and announcing billion-euro bailouts .
in the process , they 've threatened to ride roughshod over the european union 's strict limits on state aid to the private sector .
that is the view of neelie kroes , the commissioner in charge of competition for the eu , who used the wild west analogy in a sharply-worded speech in brussels on monday , oct .
13 .
an anything-goes atmosphere would be a “ recipe for chaos , ” kroes warned .
yet it ’ s unlikely that europe ’ s financial crisis will turn into a spaghetti western .
in the long run , the banking crisis will likely mean more unity in europe ’ s financial sector , say leading economists and eu banking experts .
in crisis mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current crisis has been likened to the wild west the top priority for eu leaders in recent days has been to unfreeze the credit markets .
all other concerns have taken a back seat .
more than a half dozen european countries announced bailout plans monday , with germany alone putting together a rescue package worth as much as 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 671 billion -rrb- .
“ the agenda is dominated by crisis management .
everything is suspended until we 're out of the crisis , ” iain begg , an expert on eu policies and fiscal issues at the london school of economics , told deutsche welle .
yet after the immediate crisis stabilizes , europe will need to take a broader look at its banking sector .
improving competition and regulation were issues before the crisis and now have become even more so , begg and others said .
finding a solution even as european governments announced 1.4 trillion euros in guarantees and other emergency measures , they stopped short of a one-size-fits-all bailout .
specific actions were left up to individual countries and no europe-wide fund has been established to help other countries ' troubled banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are calls for large banks to be regulated differently still , that level of unity was remarkable for the euro area , said nicolas veron of bruegel , a european think tank devoted to international economics . “ what is sure is that the europeans have reacted quickly to the crisis and that was not a foregone conclusion , ” veron told deutsche welle .
european markets reacted positively , jumping 9 percent on monday.the hope is that government guarantees will help banks overcome their reluctance to lend money to one another .
opening up competition yet veron cautioned against the idea that the road ahead would be easy .
“ what was announced yesterday will not magically solve all the problems , ” veron said .
“ the implementation will be very difficult . ”
a few hours after offering up her wild west criticism , kroes made public rules for eu member states to follow when rescuing banks .
all banks which operate in a country have to be covered by guarantees , kroes said .
this is an implied criticism of ireland , which on sept .
30 proposed covering only deposits in irish-owned banks .
the government has since revised the proposal to include non-irish banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has promised 500 billion euros “ we 've had problems with competition in europe for a long time .
most european bank markets are heavily dominated by national firms , ” said fredrik erixon , the director of the european center for international political economy -lrb- ecipe -rrb- , a think tank dedicated to trade and other international issues of importance to europe . yet multinational banks pose their own set of problems , erixon and others point out .
who would pick up the bill for bailing out the british subsidiary , say , of spain 's banco santander ?
or who would come to the rescue of the spanish arm of deutsche bank ? and would it be enough to tighten regulations on european banks ?
erixon said the worry is that people would then shift investments to asia and the us where regulations did n't exist . economists just do n't know exactly what the upcoming days and months will bring . “ we are still in the phase of crisis reaction , ” erixon said .
it 's an ending that remains to be written . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german photographer and an artist won lawsuits against google for displaying thumbnails of their works in search results without permission .
google will reportedly appeal the ruling . google can not display copyrighted works as thumbnails without an owner 's permission , a court in the northern german city of hamburg ruled on tuesday , oct 14 .
since the photos in google image search are displayed as thumbnails , no new work is created , which leaves no justification for displaying the copywrited works without permission , the court ruled .
" it does n't matter that thumbnails are much smaller than original pictures and are displayed in a lower resolution , " the court said in its ruling .
artists complain google 's image search function brings up often millions of thumbnails of photographs , pictures and other graphics culled from internet sites .
google always has a disclaimed next to images that they might be scaled down and also might be subject to copyright .
but for some that is not enough .
they do not want their images to show up in the search engine at all .
german photographer michael bernhard and artist thomas horn brought cases against google in germany to protest the display of their copyrighted images .
horn , whose comic drawings were displayed on google , has reportedly asked for about 1,300 euros plus interest to compensate for his " stolen pictures . "
google likely to appeal if the ruling ends up keeping all copyrighted images from being displayed in google , that " capitulates us into the digital stone age , " kay oberbeck , spokeswoman for google germany was quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper as saying .
google will appeal the ruling , the newspaper reported .
but if it is upheld , it could mean that google would have to turn off its image search function , the hamburger abendblatt reported .
the court suggested that google replace thumbnails of pictures with a text describing them , something google said is not a practical , user-friendly solution . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision dashes the hopes of those eu member states which had said that russia 's withdrawal from the so-called " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions was enough for the bloc to re-open talks on a wide-ranging strategic deal .

" in due course we can address the pca -lrb- successor -rrb- , " british foreign minister david miliband said , " but at the moment we should be focusing on ensuring that all the elements that were agreed in september , including the geneva talks , get going with proper speed . "

ahead of the summit , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that europe and the rest of the world must rethink financial regulation and supervisory rules , including for hedge funds and private equity , once the crisis subsides .
he said he was encouraged by stock market surges following sunday 's adoption of a coordinated 2.2 trillion euro -lrb- $ 3,023 billion -rrb- rescue plan for banks in eurozone countries .
" once we have put financial markets back on their feet , we must ensure that in the future , they function properly for the benefit of citizens and businesses , rather than themselves , " barroso said .
german news agency dpa has reported that diplomats expect the eu summit to throw its weight behind the euro-group decision rather than proposing new measures .
mending ties with russia the second crisis on the eu 's agenda ?
whether or not it should re-open talks with russia on a key strategic partnership which were frozen in the wake of the summer 's russian-georgian war .
at an emergency summit on sept .
1 , leaders agreed there would be no further talks " until troops have withdrawn to the positions held prior to aug .
7 , " the day that fighting began .
russia withdrew from " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia on oct .
9 , but has more than doubled its troop presence in the regions , occupying formerly georgian-held positions there .
this has left eu states at odds over whether conditions for restarting the talks have been fulfilled .
" for me , it 's clear that we have to start the negotiations because the spirit of the agreement has been fulfilled , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
but swedish foreign minister carl bildt disagreed .
" if you look at the maps , -lrb- the russians -rrb- are not back to the positions they held prior to aug .
7 , " he said .
ireland to report on lisbon treaty finally , the summit is set to hear a report from the irish government on the country 's rejection of the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 .
the " no " vote threw the bloc into institutional panic as the treaty can not come into effect without being ratified by every member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit will give ireland another chance to express itself the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the eu 's institutions and increase efficiency and transparency to voters .
but in ireland , many voters reported feeling confused and poorly informed about the consequences of the referendum .
there were fears that voting " yes " to the treaty would lead to ireland 's arm being twisted on such sensitive issues as military neutrality and abortion rights .
ahead of the summit , european commission vice president margot wallstroem told the irish times that she has warned member states not to push ireland into a decision about whether to hold a second referendum .
" the irish should not be forced or pushed or pressed into taking a decision that they do n't feel ready for , " she said .
she added that rumors that eu politicians would move ahead without ireland were " unrealistic . "
" there might be those who will want to go ahead on their own , but i think it is totally unrealistic , " wallstroem said .
" nobody wants to see ireland out of the eu and that is certainly not the wish of the irish people . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , postponed any decision to resume partnership talks with russia amid disagreements over whether moscow has complied with a peace deal in georgia . meeting in luxembourg , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states " noted with satisfaction that ...
russian troops have withdrawn from the zones adjacent to -lrb- the georgian breakaway regions of -rrb- south ossetia and abkhazia , " a joint statement said .
however , while the move is " an essential additional step " in the implementation of an eu-sponsored peace plan , the ministers " called on the parties to implement their commitments , " including by giving access to eu and un observers , the statement said .
the decision dashes the hopes of those eu member states which had said that russia 's withdrawal from the so-called " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions was enough for the bloc to re-open talks on a wide-ranging strategic deal .
ahead of the meeting , germany and italy stressed that it was " in the eu 's interest " to re-open talks on a successor to the current eu-russia partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many russian troops have pulled out but some remain german deputy foreign minister guenter gloser said , " there will always be some people who think the eu is doing russia a favor " with the negotiations .
but we must ask whether -lrb- the eu -rrb- would be doing itself a favor by blocking relations , given , in particular , the importance of russian fuel supplies to europe . "
and the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , proposed that ministers respond to russia 's pull-out by agreeing to re-launch talks in november .
but that proposal fell foul of resistance from eu states such as britain , poland , sweden and the baltic states , who argued that russia had not pulled its troops back to the positions they occupied before war with georgia broke out on aug .
7 , as eu leaders had demanded .
" they have made some withdrawals , primarily from the buffer zones , but there are areas which they are occupying now where they were not on aug .
7 , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said on his arrival in luxembourg .
" we have to take it fairly slowly , " added finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who currently chairs the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
russian troops allegedly still in georgia on thursday , osce monitors said moscow had pulled its forces out of the buffer zones adjacent to the separatist enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia , one day ahead of the oct .
10 deadline brokered by the eu .
but osce officials also said russian troops were still present in the akhalgori area of georgia , and french foreign minister bernard kouchner on monday acknowledged that " problems remain . "
those problems dominated talks , with ministers agreeing to make no move until they see how events unfold on the ground in georgia and how russia behaves in international talks on the crisis , set to open in geneva on wednesday .
" in due course we can address the pca -lrb- successor -rrb- , " british foreign minister david miliband said , " but at the moment we should be focusing on ensuring that all the elements that were agreed in september , including the geneva talks , get going with proper speed . "
bildunterschrift : from left , eu foreign policy chief javier solana , european commission president jose manuel barroso , french president nicolas sarkozy , russian president dmitry medvedev luxembourg 's jean asselborn acknowledged that a decision on re-starting the post-pca talks would not likely be made much before an eu-russia summit , due to take place on nov .
14 in nice .
" one solution could be to wait for the -lrb- european -rrb- commission 's report and then start the negotiations before the nov , 14 summit , " asselborn said .
some parts of agreement still unfulfilled kouchner noted that the ceasefire deal ending the russia-georgia conflict in august was not being entirely respected .
while still contesting russia 's backing for breakaway georgian territories south ossetia and abkhazia , the ministers are expected to decide that russia has kept its commitments by withdrawing troops from a buffer zone around the contested territories .
kouchner reaffirmed that russia had withdrawn its troops from buffer zones near the two breakaway georgian regions , in line with a french-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the russians have withdrawn , and apart from south ossetia and abkhazia , there are no more russia soldiers in georgia , " he said .
" we postponed " the partnership negotiations at an emergency summit on georgia on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 14.10.2008 daimler to slash us jobs as vw bucks economic downturn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler production lines in the us and canada are being closed and moved to mexico german auto giant daimler will eliminate 3,500 north american jobs owing to the worsening economic slowdown .
vw , however , bucked the downward trend and set record highs for its shares on the stock market . following announcements by nissan , renault , and volvo in europe , and restructuring by general motors and ford , utility vehicles are also unveiling hits from slumping sales .
in the united states , the market deteriorated " in a way we have not anticipated , " daimler trucks boss andreas renschler told a telephone press conference .
he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .
" as the recession deepens , the heavy-truck market is hit harder , " german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer told reporters .
" the sector will see a recession as well . "
in addition , a daimler spokeswoman told reporters , the sector is subject to regular cycles , and the german group had already expected diminished demand late this year and early in 2009 .
" it is falling back more sharply now , " she noted however .
finally , new us regulations aimed at reducing pollution have also hurt sales , daimler said .
the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .
production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .

vw , however , bucked the downward trend and set record highs for its shares on the stock market . following announcements by nissan , renault , and volvo in europe , and restructuring by general motors and ford , utility vehicles are also unveiling hits from slumping sales .
in the united states , the market deteriorated " in a way we have not anticipated , " daimler trucks boss andreas renschler told a telephone press conference .
he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .
" as the recession deepens , the heavy-truck market is hit harder , " german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer told reporters .
" the sector will see a recession as well . "
in addition , a daimler spokeswoman told reporters , the sector is subject to regular cycles , and the german group had already expected diminished demand late this year and early in 2009 .
" it is falling back more sharply now , " she noted however .
finally , new us regulations aimed at reducing pollution have also hurt sales , daimler said .
the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .
production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .

vw , however , bucked the downward trend and set record highs for its shares on the stock market . following announcements by nissan , renault , and volvo in europe , and restructuring by general motors and ford , utility vehicles are also unveiling hits from slumping sales .
in the united states , the market deteriorated " in a way we have not anticipated , " daimler trucks boss andreas renschler told a telephone press conference .
he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .
" as the recession deepens , the heavy-truck market is hit harder , " german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer told reporters .
" the sector will see a recession as well . "
in addition , a daimler spokeswoman told reporters , the sector is subject to regular cycles , and the german group had already expected diminished demand late this year and early in 2009 .
" it is falling back more sharply now , " she noted however .
finally , new us regulations aimed at reducing pollution have also hurt sales , daimler said .
the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .
production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .
as the deadline for porsche 's takeover approaches , those banks must make sure they own the shares in question .
brokers have said banks probably waited until the last minute in a bet that vw shares would fall because of the financial crisis and might be scrambling now to cover their positions .
mystery surrounds investors another hypothesis is that speculative investment funds may have targeted vw shares with the practice of short selling , in which they borrow shares that are immediately sold in expectation of being able to repurchase them later at a cheaper price before they must be returned to the original owner .
if that were the case , funds could also be buying heavily to make sure they can return the vw stock without suffering even heavier losses .

the decision dashes the hopes of those eu member states which had said that russia 's withdrawal from the so-called " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions was enough for the bloc to re-open talks on a wide-ranging strategic deal .

a german photographer and an artist won lawsuits against google for displaying thumbnails of their works in search results without permission .
google will reportedly appeal the ruling . google can not display copyrighted works as thumbnails without an owner 's permission , a court in the northern german city of hamburg ruled on tuesday , oct 14 .
since the photos in google image search are displayed as thumbnails , no new work is created , which leaves no justification for displaying the copywrited works without permission , the court ruled .
" it does n't matter that thumbnails are much smaller than original pictures and are displayed in a lower resolution , " the court said in its ruling .
artists complain google 's image search function brings up often millions of thumbnails of photographs , pictures and other graphics culled from internet sites .
google always has a disclaimed next to images that they might be scaled down and also might be subject to copyright .

a german photographer and an artist won lawsuits against google for displaying thumbnails of their works in search results without permission .
google will reportedly appeal the ruling . google can not display copyrighted works as thumbnails without an owner 's permission , a court in the northern german city of hamburg ruled on tuesday , oct 14 .
since the photos in google image search are displayed as thumbnails , no new work is created , which leaves no justification for displaying the copywrited works without permission , the court ruled .
" it does n't matter that thumbnails are much smaller than original pictures and are displayed in a lower resolution , " the court said in its ruling .
artists complain google 's image search function brings up often millions of thumbnails of photographs , pictures and other graphics culled from internet sites .
google always has a disclaimed next to images that they might be scaled down and also might be subject to copyright .
but for some that is not enough .
they do not want their images to show up in the search engine at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 14.10.2008 star defender ze roberto discusses bayern 's fall from grace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : superstar ze roberto shines , but his halo has not spread to his bayern teammates bayern munich ’ s brazilian superstar defender ze roberto , 34 , spoke to dw-world about the club 's lackluster start to the season and string of losses that have fans worrying about where germany 's premier club is heading . dw-world.de : how are you , ze ?
ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .
i have n't been able to find one .
in all my years at fc bayern munich , in my entire soccer career , i ca n't remember having such a bad start in the season .
so many people are preoccupied with finding an explanation for this -lrb- pile of successive defeats -rrb- .
my take on it is that the situation is so complex that no explanation is necessary .
we must simply work harder to reach our goal : to be at the top of the league .
what are you thinking when you look at the scoreboard and fc bayern munich is in llth place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .
this season the team has shown in a rudimentary way that it understands klinsmann 's working philosophy - in playing against cologne , against nuremburg or in the second half of the champions league playoffs against lyon .
what we 're missing is consistency and a good balance .
but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?
bildunterschrift : " now is not the time to whine and look for explanations .
the season begins anew ... "
we do n't have much time .
hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- is in the lead by seven points .
the experimental phase is over .
i 'm not the only one who knows that .
our coach knows that too .
now is not the time to keep whining or look for explanations .
we need to get our act together for upcoming games .
the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .
second , even if i had talked to fc bayern or another club about commitments starting 2009 , i would give them all the same answer : this is not the right time to discuss such matters .
i 'm only going to start thinking about my future starting in february or march of next year .
at the moment , i 'm fully focused on the current season .
third of all , a final decision of where to go or stay would be made in conjunction with my whole family .
regardless of what the future holds , my wife , my kids and i feel very much at home in munich .
fans of fc bayern munich would perhaps want to see more of you , the ze roberto , who grows better with age .
meanwhile i almost believe in my old motto .
i recently said that i 'm like a good old bottle of wine : with age , i always get better .
that seems to be the case right now . daniel martinez -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .
i have n't been able to find one .
in all my years at fc bayern munich , in my entire soccer career , i ca n't remember having such a bad start in the season .
so many people are preoccupied with finding an explanation for this -lrb- pile of successive defeats -rrb- .
my take on it is that the situation is so complex that no explanation is necessary .
we must simply work harder to reach our goal : to be at the top of the league .
what are you thinking when you look at the scoreboard and fc bayern munich is in llth place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .
this season the team has shown in a rudimentary way that it understands klinsmann 's working philosophy - in playing against cologne , against nuremburg or in the second half of the champions league playoffs against lyon .
what we 're missing is consistency and a good balance .
but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?
bildunterschrift : " now is not the time to whine and look for explanations .
the season begins anew ... "
we do n't have much time .
hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- is in the lead by seven points .
the experimental phase is over .
i 'm not the only one who knows that .
our coach knows that too .
now is not the time to keep whining or look for explanations .
we need to get our act together for upcoming games .
the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .
second , even if i had talked to fc bayern or another club about commitments starting 2009 , i would give them all the same answer : this is not the right time to discuss such matters .
i 'm only going to start thinking about my future starting in february or march of next year .
at the moment , i 'm fully focused on the current season .
third of all , a final decision of where to go or stay would be made in conjunction with my whole family .
regardless of what the future holds , my wife , my kids and i feel very much at home in munich .
fans of fc bayern munich would perhaps want to see more of you , the ze roberto , who grows better with age .
meanwhile i almost believe in my old motto .
i recently said that i 'm like a good old bottle of wine : with age , i always get better .
that seems to be the case right now . daniel martinez -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the programme accompanies three siblings pursuing their personal dreams .
betty , the youngest , is a talented singer who wants to form a choir at school .
ronnie is crazy about football and wants to become the captain of his team .
eveline , the oldest , has just finished high school and would like to become a local councillor . understanding social and political processes in the course of their actions , the three siblings have to face various obstacles .
these problems are linked to specific social and political phenomena like leadership , corruption , coalition building , media reporting and party politics .
not all of the teenagers ’ plans turn out to be successful , but betty , ronnie and eveline learn from their mistakes .
above all , the young “ political players ” start to understand a lot about what political participation means in real life … learning by ear is available in six languages : english , kiswahili , french , hausa , portuguese and amharic .

ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .
i have n't been able to find one .
in all my years at fc bayern munich , in my entire soccer career , i ca n't remember having such a bad start in the season .
so many people are preoccupied with finding an explanation for this -lrb- pile of successive defeats -rrb- .
my take on it is that the situation is so complex that no explanation is necessary .
we must simply work harder to reach our goal : to be at the top of the league .
what are you thinking when you look at the scoreboard and fc bayern munich is in llth place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .
this season the team has shown in a rudimentary way that it understands klinsmann 's working philosophy - in playing against cologne , against nuremburg or in the second half of the champions league playoffs against lyon .
what we 're missing is consistency and a good balance .
but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?
bildunterschrift : " now is not the time to whine and look for explanations .
the season begins anew ... "
we do n't have much time .
hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- is in the lead by seven points .
the experimental phase is over .
i 'm not the only one who knows that .
our coach knows that too .
now is not the time to keep whining or look for explanations .
we need to get our act together for upcoming games .
the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .
second , even if i had talked to fc bayern or another club about commitments starting 2009 , i would give them all the same answer : this is not the right time to discuss such matters .
i 'm only going to start thinking about my future starting in february or march of next year .
at the moment , i 'm fully focused on the current season .
third of all , a final decision of where to go or stay would be made in conjunction with my whole family .
regardless of what the future holds , my wife , my kids and i feel very much at home in munich .
fans of fc bayern munich would perhaps want to see more of you , the ze roberto , who grows better with age .
meanwhile i almost believe in my old motto .
i recently said that i 'm like a good old bottle of wine : with age , i always get better .
that seems to be the case right now . daniel martinez -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?
bildunterschrift : " now is not the time to whine and look for explanations .
the season begins anew ... "
we do n't have much time .
hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- is in the lead by seven points .
the experimental phase is over .
i 'm not the only one who knows that .
our coach knows that too .
now is not the time to keep whining or look for explanations .
we need to get our act together for upcoming games .
the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .
second , even if i had talked to fc bayern or another club about commitments starting 2009 , i would give them all the same answer : this is not the right time to discuss such matters .
i 'm only going to start thinking about my future starting in february or march of next year .
at the moment , i 'm fully focused on the current season .
third of all , a final decision of where to go or stay would be made in conjunction with my whole family .
regardless of what the future holds , my wife , my kids and i feel very much at home in munich .
fans of fc bayern munich would perhaps want to see more of you , the ze roberto , who grows better with age .
meanwhile i almost believe in my old motto .
i recently said that i 'm like a good old bottle of wine : with age , i always get better .

ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .
i have n't been able to find one .
in all my years at fc bayern munich , in my entire soccer career , i ca n't remember having such a bad start in the season .
so many people are preoccupied with finding an explanation for this -lrb- pile of successive defeats -rrb- .
my take on it is that the situation is so complex that no explanation is necessary .
we must simply work harder to reach our goal : to be at the top of the league .
what are you thinking when you look at the scoreboard and fc bayern munich is in llth place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .

" unlike the banks , they are not to blame for their misery . "
she added that the current hunger crisis is " far worse " than the financial crisis .
" if the global hunger crisis were taken as seriously as the crisis in the financial markets , we would have found a solution long ago , " she said .
" and yet it is much worse and poses a threat to millions of lives . "
together with the washington-based international food policy research institute -lrb- ifpri -rrb- , schäuble presented the global hunger index -lrb- ghi -rrb- 2008 ahead of world food day on thursday , oct .
16 .
according to the index , which is based on the three variables of malnutrition , underweight children and child mortality , 33 countries are currently registering " alarming " or " extremely alarming " levels of hunger .
some 923 million people - one in six people on the planet - go hungry every day .
of that number , 907 million live in developing countries .
schäuble said that an additional 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.7 billion -rrb- in aid was necessary to combat the situation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 14.10.2008 eu set for " crisis management " summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of financial recovery is expected to dominate the summit eu leaders meeting in brussels this week have lots on their plate with a financial crisis raging , soured relations with russia , and questions about the bloc 's future after ireland 's rejection of the lisbon treaty . at the top of the agenda in brussels will be the issue of how the eu can work to restore confidence in financial markets traumatized by the worst declines in almost 80 years .
ahead of the summit , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that europe and the rest of the world must rethink financial regulation and supervisory rules , including for hedge funds and private equity , once the crisis subsides .
he said he was encouraged by stock market surges following sunday 's adoption of a coordinated 2.2 trillion euro -lrb- $ 3,023 billion -rrb- rescue plan for banks in eurozone countries .
" once we have put financial markets back on their feet , we must ensure that in the future , they function properly for the benefit of citizens and businesses , rather than themselves , " barroso said .
german news agency dpa has reported that diplomats expect the eu summit to throw its weight behind the euro-group decision rather than proposing new measures .
mending ties with russia the second crisis on the eu 's agenda ?
whether or not it should re-open talks with russia on a key strategic partnership which were frozen in the wake of the summer 's russian-georgian war .
at an emergency summit on sept .
1 , leaders agreed there would be no further talks " until troops have withdrawn to the positions held prior to aug .
7 , " the day that fighting began .
russia withdrew from " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia on oct .

ahead of the summit , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that europe and the rest of the world must rethink financial regulation and supervisory rules , including for hedge funds and private equity , once the crisis subsides .
he said he was encouraged by stock market surges following sunday 's adoption of a coordinated 2.2 trillion euro -lrb- $ 3,023 billion -rrb- rescue plan for banks in eurozone countries .
" once we have put financial markets back on their feet , we must ensure that in the future , they function properly for the benefit of citizens and businesses , rather than themselves , " barroso said .
german news agency dpa has reported that diplomats expect the eu summit to throw its weight behind the euro-group decision rather than proposing new measures .
mending ties with russia the second crisis on the eu 's agenda ?
whether or not it should re-open talks with russia on a key strategic partnership which were frozen in the wake of the summer 's russian-georgian war .
at an emergency summit on sept .
1 , leaders agreed there would be no further talks " until troops have withdrawn to the positions held prior to aug .
7 , " the day that fighting began .
russia withdrew from " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia on oct .
9 , but has more than doubled its troop presence in the regions , occupying formerly georgian-held positions there .
this has left eu states at odds over whether conditions for restarting the talks have been fulfilled .
" for me , it 's clear that we have to start the negotiations because the spirit of the agreement has been fulfilled , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
but swedish foreign minister carl bildt disagreed .
" if you look at the maps , -lrb- the russians -rrb- are not back to the positions they held prior to aug .
7 , " he said .
ireland to report on lisbon treaty finally , the summit is set to hear a report from the irish government on the country 's rejection of the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 .
the " no " vote threw the bloc into institutional panic as the treaty can not come into effect without being ratified by every member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit will give ireland another chance to express itself the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the eu 's institutions and increase efficiency and transparency to voters .
but in ireland , many voters reported feeling confused and poorly informed about the consequences of the referendum .
there were fears that voting " yes " to the treaty would lead to ireland 's arm being twisted on such sensitive issues as military neutrality and abortion rights .
ahead of the summit , european commission vice president margot wallstroem told the irish times that she has warned member states not to push ireland into a decision about whether to hold a second referendum .
" the irish should not be forced or pushed or pressed into taking a decision that they do n't feel ready for , " she said .
she added that rumors that eu politicians would move ahead without ireland were " unrealistic . "
" there might be those who will want to go ahead on their own , but i think it is totally unrealistic , " wallstroem said .
" nobody wants to see ireland out of the eu and that is certainly not the wish of the irish people . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the united states , the market deteriorated " in a way we have not anticipated , " daimler trucks boss andreas renschler told a telephone press conference .
he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .
" as the recession deepens , the heavy-truck market is hit harder , " german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer told reporters .
" the sector will see a recession as well . "
in addition , a daimler spokeswoman told reporters , the sector is subject to regular cycles , and the german group had already expected diminished demand late this year and early in 2009 .
" it is falling back more sharply now , " she noted however .
finally , new us regulations aimed at reducing pollution have also hurt sales , daimler said .
the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .
production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .
as the deadline for porsche 's takeover approaches , those banks must make sure they own the shares in question .
brokers have said banks probably waited until the last minute in a bet that vw shares would fall because of the financial crisis and might be scrambling now to cover their positions .
mystery surrounds investors another hypothesis is that speculative investment funds may have targeted vw shares with the practice of short selling , in which they borrow shares that are immediately sold in expectation of being able to repurchase them later at a cheaper price before they must be returned to the original owner .
if that were the case , funds could also be buying heavily to make sure they can return the vw stock without suffering even heavier losses .
" people must unwind short positions because they are losing money , " baader bank strategist robert halver told reporters .
but in the end , even market specialists say that " no one knows who is holding the positions , who the speculative funds might be , who is buying or selling for porsche , " in the words of bhf-bank analyst albrecht denninghoff .
" we do not know how many people are on board the ship .
" there is no transparency in the markets .
at that point , anything is possible . "
halver goes even further , saying that even funds caught short trying to profit from short selling would not fully explain vw 's soaring share price .
" it is just not possible , " he said .
" bafin should open an investigation , " halver added in reference to germany 's financial market regulator .

he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .
" as the recession deepens , the heavy-truck market is hit harder , " german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer told reporters .
" the sector will see a recession as well . "
in addition , a daimler spokeswoman told reporters , the sector is subject to regular cycles , and the german group had already expected diminished demand late this year and early in 2009 .
" it is falling back more sharply now , " she noted however .
finally , new us regulations aimed at reducing pollution have also hurt sales , daimler said .
the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .
production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .
as the deadline for porsche 's takeover approaches , those banks must make sure they own the shares in question .
brokers have said banks probably waited until the last minute in a bet that vw shares would fall because of the financial crisis and might be scrambling now to cover their positions .
mystery surrounds investors another hypothesis is that speculative investment funds may have targeted vw shares with the practice of short selling , in which they borrow shares that are immediately sold in expectation of being able to repurchase them later at a cheaper price before they must be returned to the original owner .
if that were the case , funds could also be buying heavily to make sure they can return the vw stock without suffering even heavier losses .
" people must unwind short positions because they are losing money , " baader bank strategist robert halver told reporters .
but in the end , even market specialists say that " no one knows who is holding the positions , who the speculative funds might be , who is buying or selling for porsche , " in the words of bhf-bank analyst albrecht denninghoff .
" we do not know how many people are on board the ship .
" there is no transparency in the markets .
at that point , anything is possible . "
halver goes even further , saying that even funds caught short trying to profit from short selling would not fully explain vw 's soaring share price .
" it is just not possible , " he said .

he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .
" as the recession deepens , the heavy-truck market is hit harder , " german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer told reporters .
" the sector will see a recession as well . "
in addition , a daimler spokeswoman told reporters , the sector is subject to regular cycles , and the german group had already expected diminished demand late this year and early in 2009 .
" it is falling back more sharply now , " she noted however .
finally , new us regulations aimed at reducing pollution have also hurt sales , daimler said .
the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .
production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .
as the deadline for porsche 's takeover approaches , those banks must make sure they own the shares in question .
brokers have said banks probably waited until the last minute in a bet that vw shares would fall because of the financial crisis and might be scrambling now to cover their positions .
mystery surrounds investors another hypothesis is that speculative investment funds may have targeted vw shares with the practice of short selling , in which they borrow shares that are immediately sold in expectation of being able to repurchase them later at a cheaper price before they must be returned to the original owner .
if that were the case , funds could also be buying heavily to make sure they can return the vw stock without suffering even heavier losses .
" people must unwind short positions because they are losing money , " baader bank strategist robert halver told reporters .
but in the end , even market specialists say that " no one knows who is holding the positions , who the speculative funds might be , who is buying or selling for porsche , " in the words of bhf-bank analyst albrecht denninghoff .
" we do not know how many people are on board the ship .
" there is no transparency in the markets .
at that point , anything is possible . "
halver goes even further , saying that even funds caught short trying to profit from short selling would not fully explain vw 's soaring share price .
" it is just not possible , " he said .
" bafin should open an investigation , " halver added in reference to germany 's financial market regulator .
a spokeswoman for the market watchdog told the afp news agency it is examining the data .
“ it is not a formal investigation , " she added . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian negotiators said they would not show up unless the two regions , which russia has recognized as independent nations , had a seat at the table for the talks scheduled for wednesday in the swiss capital .

moscow flew in the face of western criticism and recognized the two regions as independent after routing a georgian offensive to take back control over south ossetia in august .

a german photographer and an artist won lawsuits against google for displaying thumbnails of their works in search results without permission .
google will reportedly appeal the ruling . google can not display copyrighted works as thumbnails without an owner 's permission , a court in the northern german city of hamburg ruled on tuesday , oct 14 .
since the photos in google image search are displayed as thumbnails , no new work is created , which leaves no justification for displaying the copywrited works without permission , the court ruled .
" it does n't matter that thumbnails are much smaller than original pictures and are displayed in a lower resolution , " the court said in its ruling .
artists complain google 's image search function brings up often millions of thumbnails of photographs , pictures and other graphics culled from internet sites .
google always has a disclaimed next to images that they might be scaled down and also might be subject to copyright .
but for some that is not enough .
they do not want their images to show up in the search engine at all .
german photographer michael bernhard and artist thomas horn brought cases against google in germany to protest the display of their copyrighted images .
horn , whose comic drawings were displayed on google , has reportedly asked for about 1,300 euros plus interest to compensate for his " stolen pictures . "
google likely to appeal if the ruling ends up keeping all copyrighted images from being displayed in google , that " capitulates us into the digital stone age , " kay oberbeck , spokeswoman for google germany was quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper as saying .
google will appeal the ruling , the newspaper reported .
but if it is upheld , it could mean that google would have to turn off its image search function , the hamburger abendblatt reported .
the court suggested that google replace thumbnails of pictures with a text describing them , something google said is not a practical , user-friendly solution . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gloomy news was a sharp contrast to a strong showing by european stock markets on tuesday . the world financial crisis will bring germany 's economic growth nearly to a halt , according to a twice-yearly economic report released in berlin .
the economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2009 to just 0.2 percent .
previously , the institutes had projected 1.4 percent growth .
germany is expected to finish out 2008 with an overall growth rate of 1.8 percent .
" the german economy is on the edge of a recession , " said udo ludwig from the iwh economic institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends on high-end exports for its well-being germany , the world 's leading export nation , faces a sharp fall in foreign demand as the world economy slows .
the weaker growth outlook could result in job losses of 400,000 in germany next year , the institutes also warned .
germany 's economy ministry will unveil its own growth estimates on thursday , which are also expected to be revised sharply lower .
investor confidence plunges these growth rates make up the economists ' " basic scenario . "
but in view of the exceptionally high level of uncertainty brought by the international financial crisis , the economists also drew up a more pessimistic " risk scenario . "
in this scenario , the german economy would actually contract by 0.8 percent next year .
but the experts said they do expect the economy to stabilize by the end of 2009 , according to the report .
the institutes participating in the study include ifo in munich , ifw in kiel , rwi in essen and iwh in halle , together with the austrian think tanks wifo and ihs and switzerland 's kof .
germany 's zew index of financial sector confidence , also released tuesday , plunged this month .
however , the institute said it would likely rebound following a major european bank rescue plan announced sunday .
the indicator fell by 21.9 points to minus 63.0 points , the second lowest level since the start of the survey in december 1991 .
the zew economic research institute said its results had been gathered in the heat of the international financial crisis .
france , britain also struggling germany is n't alone in looking ahead to tough economic times .
the bank of france predicted growth will drop to minus 0.1 percent in the third quarter , showing the country was heading into recession after a 0.3 percent contraction in the previous three months , according to a report released tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stock market has been on a wild ride britain 's inflation rate was also reported to have reached a 16-year high of 5.2 percent in september , afp news agency reported tuesday .
britain 's statistics office said higher gas and electricity costs have fueled the increases .
the inflation level is more than double the government 's 2 percent target .

the gloomy news was a sharp contrast to a strong showing by european stock markets on tuesday . the world financial crisis will bring germany 's economic growth nearly to a halt , according to a twice-yearly economic report released in berlin .
the economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2009 to just 0.2 percent .
previously , the institutes had projected 1.4 percent growth .
germany is expected to finish out 2008 with an overall growth rate of 1.8 percent .
" the german economy is on the edge of a recession , " said udo ludwig from the iwh economic institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends on high-end exports for its well-being germany , the world 's leading export nation , faces a sharp fall in foreign demand as the world economy slows .
the weaker growth outlook could result in job losses of 400,000 in germany next year , the institutes also warned .
germany 's economy ministry will unveil its own growth estimates on thursday , which are also expected to be revised sharply lower .
investor confidence plunges these growth rates make up the economists ' " basic scenario . "
but in view of the exceptionally high level of uncertainty brought by the international financial crisis , the economists also drew up a more pessimistic " risk scenario . "
in this scenario , the german economy would actually contract by 0.8 percent next year .
but the experts said they do expect the economy to stabilize by the end of 2009 , according to the report .
the institutes participating in the study include ifo in munich , ifw in kiel , rwi in essen and iwh in halle , together with the austrian think tanks wifo and ihs and switzerland 's kof .
germany 's zew index of financial sector confidence , also released tuesday , plunged this month .
however , the institute said it would likely rebound following a major european bank rescue plan announced sunday .
the indicator fell by 21.9 points to minus 63.0 points , the second lowest level since the start of the survey in december 1991 .
the zew economic research institute said its results had been gathered in the heat of the international financial crisis .
france , britain also struggling germany is n't alone in looking ahead to tough economic times .
the bank of france predicted growth will drop to minus 0.1 percent in the third quarter , showing the country was heading into recession after a 0.3 percent contraction in the previous three months , according to a report released tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stock market has been on a wild ride britain 's inflation rate was also reported to have reached a 16-year high of 5.2 percent in september , afp news agency reported tuesday .
britain 's statistics office said higher gas and electricity costs have fueled the increases .
the inflation level is more than double the government 's 2 percent target .
economists said they believe inflation will level off and return to the target level by the end of 2009 .

tellkamp 's nearly 1,000-page tome is about the disintegration of former east germany , leading to the collapse of the communist regime in 1989 .

a german photographer and an artist won lawsuits against google for displaying thumbnails of their works in search results without permission .
google will reportedly appeal the ruling . google can not display copyrighted works as thumbnails without an owner 's permission , a court in the northern german city of hamburg ruled on tuesday , oct 14 .
since the photos in google image search are displayed as thumbnails , no new work is created , which leaves no justification for displaying the copywrited works without permission , the court ruled .

tellkamp 's nearly 1,000-page tome is about the disintegration of former east germany , leading to the collapse of the communist regime in 1989 .
the semi-autobiographical saga spans three generations of a of an elite group of dresden intellectuals and artists living in an ivory tower high above the baroque city that was once called the florence of the elbe and demolished by allied bombs at the end of the war .
the main protagonist , who is the son of a doctor and a nurse , rebels against the system as the novel traverses east german literary circles , political institutions , schools and clinics .
author jailed in communist east germany tellkamp , 39 , is a medical doctor who wrote " der turm " between hospital shifts .
he was born in dresden and jailed for his " political unreliability " just before the communist regime dissolved and germany was reunified .
afterwards , tellkamp embarked on his medical studies in newyork and the eastern german city of leipzig before working as a doctor in a dresden clinic .
bildunterschrift : the former eastern baroque city of dresden is the backdrop of an epic that spans three generations tellkamp has published one other novel , a thriller called " der eisvogel " -lrb- the kingfisher -rrb- that was hailed by literary critics but had a first run of only 163 copies .
he also writes poetry and lives in freiburg where he now writes full-time .
book critics were full of praise for " der turm , " but warned that the book is not light reading with its ponderous metaphors and poetic style .
some said he could one day be recognized as a " great german author . "
experiencing history through literature sabine franke of the german daily frankfurter rundschau said that the novel " is not about uncovering facts , but about experiencing history through literature .
this is a book for insiders -lrb- former east germans -rrb- , for those who remember , who were there themselves .
but at the same time , it is a book for posterity and parallel worlds , for those who come after and for whom this moment in history can only be contemplated from the outside . "
the five other finalists were dietmar dath for " die abschaffung der arten " -lrb- " the abolition of the species " -rrb- ; sherko fatah for " das dunkle schiff " -lrb- " the dark ship " -rrb- ; iris hanika for " treffen sich zwei " -lrb- " when two meet " -rrb- ; rolf lappert for " nach hause schwimmen " -lrb- " swimming home " -rrb- ; and ingo schulze for " adam und evelyn " -lrb- " adam and evelyn " -rrb- .
tellkamp was awarded 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 dollars -rrb- in prize money and the runners-up were each awarded 2,500 euros .
the german book prize showcases young and upcoming literary talent , launching them on the international scene .

ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .
i have n't been able to find one .
in all my years at fc bayern munich , in my entire soccer career , i ca n't remember having such a bad start in the season .
so many people are preoccupied with finding an explanation for this -lrb- pile of successive defeats -rrb- .
my take on it is that the situation is so complex that no explanation is necessary .
we must simply work harder to reach our goal : to be at the top of the league .
what are you thinking when you look at the scoreboard and fc bayern munich is in llth place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .
this season the team has shown in a rudimentary way that it understands klinsmann 's working philosophy - in playing against cologne , against nuremburg or in the second half of the champions league playoffs against lyon .
what we 're missing is consistency and a good balance .
but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?
bildunterschrift : " now is not the time to whine and look for explanations .
the season begins anew ... "
we do n't have much time .
hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- is in the lead by seven points .
the experimental phase is over .
i 'm not the only one who knows that .
our coach knows that too .
now is not the time to keep whining or look for explanations .
we need to get our act together for upcoming games .
the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .
second , even if i had talked to fc bayern or another club about commitments starting 2009 , i would give them all the same answer : this is not the right time to discuss such matters .
i 'm only going to start thinking about my future starting in february or march of next year .
at the moment , i 'm fully focused on the current season .
third of all , a final decision of where to go or stay would be made in conjunction with my whole family .
regardless of what the future holds , my wife , my kids and i feel very much at home in munich .
fans of fc bayern munich would perhaps want to see more of you , the ze roberto , who grows better with age .
meanwhile i almost believe in my old motto .
i recently said that i 'm like a good old bottle of wine : with age , i always get better .
that seems to be the case right now . daniel martinez -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gloomy news was a sharp contrast to a strong showing by european stock markets on tuesday . the world financial crisis will bring germany 's economic growth nearly to a halt , according to a twice-yearly economic report released in berlin .
the economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2009 to just 0.2 percent .
previously , the institutes had projected 1.4 percent growth .
germany is expected to finish out 2008 with an overall growth rate of 1.8 percent .
" the german economy is on the edge of a recession , " said udo ludwig from the iwh economic institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends on high-end exports for its well-being germany , the world 's leading export nation , faces a sharp fall in foreign demand as the world economy slows .
the weaker growth outlook could result in job losses of 400,000 in germany next year , the institutes also warned .
germany 's economy ministry will unveil its own growth estimates on thursday , which are also expected to be revised sharply lower .
investor confidence plunges these growth rates make up the economists ' " basic scenario . "
but in view of the exceptionally high level of uncertainty brought by the international financial crisis , the economists also drew up a more pessimistic " risk scenario . "
in this scenario , the german economy would actually contract by 0.8 percent next year .
but the experts said they do expect the economy to stabilize by the end of 2009 , according to the report .
the institutes participating in the study include ifo in munich , ifw in kiel , rwi in essen and iwh in halle , together with the austrian think tanks wifo and ihs and switzerland 's kof .
germany 's zew index of financial sector confidence , also released tuesday , plunged this month .
however , the institute said it would likely rebound following a major european bank rescue plan announced sunday .
the indicator fell by 21.9 points to minus 63.0 points , the second lowest level since the start of the survey in december 1991 .
the zew economic research institute said its results had been gathered in the heat of the international financial crisis .
france , britain also struggling germany is n't alone in looking ahead to tough economic times .
the bank of france predicted growth will drop to minus 0.1 percent in the third quarter , showing the country was heading into recession after a 0.3 percent contraction in the previous three months , according to a report released tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stock market has been on a wild ride britain 's inflation rate was also reported to have reached a 16-year high of 5.2 percent in september , afp news agency reported tuesday .
britain 's statistics office said higher gas and electricity costs have fueled the increases .
the inflation level is more than double the government 's 2 percent target .
economists said they believe inflation will level off and return to the target level by the end of 2009 .
stocks soar on rescue plan the dour outlook was in sharp contrast to stock price increases around europe .
investors took comfort in the coordinated european bank rescue plans announced monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.10.2008 eu postpones decision on resumption of russian relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france proposed to re-launch talks in november european union foreign ministers on monday , oct .
13 , postponed any decision to resume partnership talks with russia amid disagreements over whether moscow has complied with a peace deal in georgia . meeting in luxembourg , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states " noted with satisfaction that ...
russian troops have withdrawn from the zones adjacent to -lrb- the georgian breakaway regions of -rrb- south ossetia and abkhazia , " a joint statement said .
however , while the move is " an essential additional step " in the implementation of an eu-sponsored peace plan , the ministers " called on the parties to implement their commitments , " including by giving access to eu and un observers , the statement said .
the decision dashes the hopes of those eu member states which had said that russia 's withdrawal from the so-called " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions was enough for the bloc to re-open talks on a wide-ranging strategic deal .
ahead of the meeting , germany and italy stressed that it was " in the eu 's interest " to re-open talks on a successor to the current eu-russia partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many russian troops have pulled out but some remain german deputy foreign minister guenter gloser said , " there will always be some people who think the eu is doing russia a favor " with the negotiations .
but we must ask whether -lrb- the eu -rrb- would be doing itself a favor by blocking relations , given , in particular , the importance of russian fuel supplies to europe . "
and the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , proposed that ministers respond to russia 's pull-out by agreeing to re-launch talks in november .
but that proposal fell foul of resistance from eu states such as britain , poland , sweden and the baltic states , who argued that russia had not pulled its troops back to the positions they occupied before war with georgia broke out on aug .
7 , as eu leaders had demanded .
" they have made some withdrawals , primarily from the buffer zones , but there are areas which they are occupying now where they were not on aug .
7 , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said on his arrival in luxembourg .
" we have to take it fairly slowly , " added finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who currently chairs the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
russian troops allegedly still in georgia on thursday , osce monitors said moscow had pulled its forces out of the buffer zones adjacent to the separatist enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia , one day ahead of the oct .
10 deadline brokered by the eu .
but osce officials also said russian troops were still present in the akhalgori area of georgia , and french foreign minister bernard kouchner on monday acknowledged that " problems remain . "
those problems dominated talks , with ministers agreeing to make no move until they see how events unfold on the ground in georgia and how russia behaves in international talks on the crisis , set to open in geneva on wednesday .
" in due course we can address the pca -lrb- successor -rrb- , " british foreign minister david miliband said , " but at the moment we should be focusing on ensuring that all the elements that were agreed in september , including the geneva talks , get going with proper speed . "
bildunterschrift : from left , eu foreign policy chief javier solana , european commission president jose manuel barroso , french president nicolas sarkozy , russian president dmitry medvedev luxembourg 's jean asselborn acknowledged that a decision on re-starting the post-pca talks would not likely be made much before an eu-russia summit , due to take place on nov .
14 in nice .
" one solution could be to wait for the -lrb- european -rrb- commission 's report and then start the negotiations before the nov , 14 summit , " asselborn said .
some parts of agreement still unfulfilled kouchner noted that the ceasefire deal ending the russia-georgia conflict in august was not being entirely respected .
while still contesting russia 's backing for breakaway georgian territories south ossetia and abkhazia , the ministers are expected to decide that russia has kept its commitments by withdrawing troops from a buffer zone around the contested territories .
kouchner reaffirmed that russia had withdrawn its troops from buffer zones near the two breakaway georgian regions , in line with a french-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the russians have withdrawn , and apart from south ossetia and abkhazia , there are no more russia soldiers in georgia , " he said .
" we postponed " the partnership negotiations at an emergency summit on georgia on sept .
1 , called after russia recognized the independence of rebel abkhazia and south ossetia , he recalled .
but he said that of the six-points in the peace agreement reached on aug .
12 between french president nicolas sarkozy and his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev , " we have fulfilled between two and three " points .

ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .
i have n't been able to find one .
in all my years at fc bayern munich , in my entire soccer career , i ca n't remember having such a bad start in the season .
so many people are preoccupied with finding an explanation for this -lrb- pile of successive defeats -rrb- .
my take on it is that the situation is so complex that no explanation is necessary .
we must simply work harder to reach our goal : to be at the top of the league .
what are you thinking when you look at the scoreboard and fc bayern munich is in llth place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .
this season the team has shown in a rudimentary way that it understands klinsmann 's working philosophy - in playing against cologne , against nuremburg or in the second half of the champions league playoffs against lyon .
what we 're missing is consistency and a good balance .
but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?
bildunterschrift : " now is not the time to whine and look for explanations .
the season begins anew ... "
we do n't have much time .
hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- is in the lead by seven points .
the experimental phase is over .
i 'm not the only one who knows that .
our coach knows that too .
now is not the time to keep whining or look for explanations .
we need to get our act together for upcoming games .
the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .
second , even if i had talked to fc bayern or another club about commitments starting 2009 , i would give them all the same answer : this is not the right time to discuss such matters .
i 'm only going to start thinking about my future starting in february or march of next year .
at the moment , i 'm fully focused on the current season .
third of all , a final decision of where to go or stay would be made in conjunction with my whole family .
regardless of what the future holds , my wife , my kids and i feel very much at home in munich .
fans of fc bayern munich would perhaps want to see more of you , the ze roberto , who grows better with age .
meanwhile i almost believe in my old motto .
i recently said that i 'm like a good old bottle of wine : with age , i always get better .
that seems to be the case right now . daniel martinez -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ze roberto : not so good .
at least things are not going the way i want them to .
why not ?
you 're bayern munich 's best player at the moment .
maybe so , but the team is going a difficult phase , our position in the german bundesliga is very complicated .
thank goodness it 's different in the champions league .
can you explain what you mean ?
no , i do n't have an explanation .
i have n't been able to find one .
in all my years at fc bayern munich , in my entire soccer career , i ca n't remember having such a bad start in the season .
so many people are preoccupied with finding an explanation for this -lrb- pile of successive defeats -rrb- .
my take on it is that the situation is so complex that no explanation is necessary .
we must simply work harder to reach our goal : to be at the top of the league .
what are you thinking when you look at the scoreboard and fc bayern munich is in llth place ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are getting impatient after string of defeats i think about the next game , the chance to win three points with a victory , so that we can focus on moving up the ranks .
is n't there any loss of self-confidence or frustration ?
nope , those feelings are n't there , since i know that all the cards remain in our hands .
the bundesliga had seven days of matches .
if we had a similar situation seven games before the end of the season , maybe we could talk about self-doubts and frustration , but not now .
the season has just begun , we 've still got time to catch up , to work hard and leave this dismal start behind us .
you are the one player at fc bayern munich , who has something to celebrate .
your performance has been sensational this season , something that has n't spilled over to the rest of your teammates .
i do n't have a reason to rejoice .
when a team does well , all players benefit , but it ai n't so the other way around .
i think first in group terms and realize that it does no good for individuals to shine , when we as a collective team are going through a difficult patch .
but you ought to be proud of yourself .
well , i am proud .
when we came back to munich after the summer holidays , i promised myself to make this the best season of my career .
my last season went really well , but i 'd still like to beat it .
still , it helps no one , not even me who personally experienced a very good year , when at the end of the day , we have n't won any titles .
the goals i scored and my performance would be meaningless then , when it does n't follow that the entire team has n't achieved something .
that 's why i 'm not so happy .
today one has the impression that this goal " to achieve something " is almost beyond the reach … no , i do n't think that our goal lies so far ahead .
i 'm certain we can do better , that we wo n't stagnate at the bottom of the rankings .
we will leave a good season behind us .
we are now testing a new working philosophy and every beginning is a tough challenge .
we need to make juergen klinsmann 's -lrb- former national coach who took over as trainer this july -rrb- new methods , which every player has incorporated every single day , work for us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new bayern coach -lrb- right -rrb- klinsmann experiments with team so many critics say that you are the only fc bayern munich player who has truly gotten better ..
that will also happen to the entire team .
i believe that due to my age and experience as a soccer player , i 've been able to better grapple with the klinsmann philosophy .
i understood juergen klinsmann from the very beginning .
i can see why he experiments , why he takes a certain course of action .
it is clear to me what he wants and how he wants to achieve objectives .
this experimental phase is part and parcel of a strategic plan .
this season the team has shown in a rudimentary way that it understands klinsmann 's working philosophy - in playing against cologne , against nuremburg or in the second half of the champions league playoffs against lyon .
what we 're missing is consistency and a good balance .
but due to this improper balance -lrb- that has led to poor results -rrb- , klinsmann finds himself under attack and in the position of having to explain his methods .
what do you make of the whole debacle ?
ever since juergen klinsmann has become our coach , he 's experimented with a number of things : new systems , new players , new configurations on the playing field , new ideas .
he is seeking ways to optimize team performance , but before he finds his way , he needs to experiment .
klinsmann comes with his own mindset .
he knows individual team players and kept an eye on them last season , those who won championships and titles .
but he needs to experiment with fc bayern munich as a whole and learn how the team works together .
it 's somewhat unfair to make snap judgements , without bearing in mind that he barely started as coach in july and is planning for the long haul .
his contract goes for three years .
but fans are getting impatient ..
i 'm aware that they want to see results , their reaction is understandable , but fans think like fans , not like the coach or club managers , who are thinking more long term about the future .
the fans need to be patient and trust us .
how long do they need to wait for these experiments to reap results ?
bildunterschrift : " now is not the time to whine and look for explanations .
the season begins anew ... "
we do n't have much time .
hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- is in the lead by seven points .
the experimental phase is over .
i 'm not the only one who knows that .
our coach knows that too .
now is not the time to keep whining or look for explanations .
we need to get our act together for upcoming games .
the season begins anew with our match against fc karlsruhe .
this is your last season in germany .
have you managed to master english ?
no , why should i learn english ?
because you want to move to fc dallas in the us ..
nah ..
fc dallas like other clubs have expressed an interest in me , but i have n't yet made up my mind about staying in germany or not .
have n't you already turned down an offer from fc bayern munich to prolong your contract ?
no .
just to clear up any misunderstanding , i need to make the following points clear : first of all , i have not even talked to bayern about the possibility of extending my contract .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.10.2008 europe 's bank rescue signals end of era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european stock markets rebounded after the bailouts were announced big changes are in store for european banks after the latest round of bailouts were announced .
in the long term , it could mean more eu-wide regulation . recent days have seen european governments galloping to the rescue of struggling banks , approving mergers and announcing billion-euro bailouts .
in the process , they 've threatened to ride roughshod over the european union 's strict limits on state aid to the private sector .
that is the view of neelie kroes , the commissioner in charge of competition for the eu , who used the wild west analogy in a sharply-worded speech in brussels on monday , oct .
13 .
an anything-goes atmosphere would be a “ recipe for chaos , ” kroes warned .
yet it ’ s unlikely that europe ’ s financial crisis will turn into a spaghetti western .
in the long run , the banking crisis will likely mean more unity in europe ’ s financial sector , say leading economists and eu banking experts .
in crisis mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current crisis has been likened to the wild west the top priority for eu leaders in recent days has been to unfreeze the credit markets .
all other concerns have taken a back seat .
more than a half dozen european countries announced bailout plans monday , with germany alone putting together a rescue package worth as much as 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 671 billion -rrb- .
“ the agenda is dominated by crisis management .
everything is suspended until we 're out of the crisis , ” iain begg , an expert on eu policies and fiscal issues at the london school of economics , told deutsche welle .
yet after the immediate crisis stabilizes , europe will need to take a broader look at its banking sector .
improving competition and regulation were issues before the crisis and now have become even more so , begg and others said .
finding a solution even as european governments announced 1.4 trillion euros in guarantees and other emergency measures , they stopped short of a one-size-fits-all bailout .
specific actions were left up to individual countries and no europe-wide fund has been established to help other countries ' troubled banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are calls for large banks to be regulated differently still , that level of unity was remarkable for the euro area , said nicolas veron of bruegel , a european think tank devoted to international economics . “ what is sure is that the europeans have reacted quickly to the crisis and that was not a foregone conclusion , ” veron told deutsche welle .
european markets reacted positively , jumping 9 percent on monday.the hope is that government guarantees will help banks overcome their reluctance to lend money to one another .
opening up competition yet veron cautioned against the idea that the road ahead would be easy .
“ what was announced yesterday will not magically solve all the problems , ” veron said .
“ the implementation will be very difficult . ”
a few hours after offering up her wild west criticism , kroes made public rules for eu member states to follow when rescuing banks .
all banks which operate in a country have to be covered by guarantees , kroes said .
this is an implied criticism of ireland , which on sept .
30 proposed covering only deposits in irish-owned banks .
the government has since revised the proposal to include non-irish banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has promised 500 billion euros “ we 've had problems with competition in europe for a long time .
most european bank markets are heavily dominated by national firms , ” said fredrik erixon , the director of the european center for international political economy -lrb- ecipe -rrb- , a think tank dedicated to trade and other international issues of importance to europe . yet multinational banks pose their own set of problems , erixon and others point out .
who would pick up the bill for bailing out the british subsidiary , say , of spain 's banco santander ?
or who would come to the rescue of the spanish arm of deutsche bank ? and would it be enough to tighten regulations on european banks ?
erixon said the worry is that people would then shift investments to asia and the us where regulations did n't exist . economists just do n't know exactly what the upcoming days and months will bring . “ we are still in the phase of crisis reaction , ” erixon said .
it 's an ending that remains to be written . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the long term , it could mean more eu-wide regulation . recent days have seen european governments galloping to the rescue of struggling banks , approving mergers and announcing billion-euro bailouts .
in the process , they 've threatened to ride roughshod over the european union 's strict limits on state aid to the private sector .
that is the view of neelie kroes , the commissioner in charge of competition for the eu , who used the wild west analogy in a sharply-worded speech in brussels on monday , oct .

in the long run , the banking crisis will likely mean more unity in europe ’ s financial sector , say leading economists and eu banking experts .

all other concerns have taken a back seat .
more than a half dozen european countries announced bailout plans monday , with germany alone putting together a rescue package worth as much as 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 671 billion -rrb- .
“ the agenda is dominated by crisis management .
everything is suspended until we 're out of the crisis , ” iain begg , an expert on eu policies and fiscal issues at the london school of economics , told deutsche welle .

all banks which operate in a country have to be covered by guarantees , kroes said .
this is an implied criticism of ireland , which on sept .

a german photographer and an artist won lawsuits against google for displaying thumbnails of their works in search results without permission .
google will reportedly appeal the ruling . google can not display copyrighted works as thumbnails without an owner 's permission , a court in the northern german city of hamburg ruled on tuesday , oct 14 .
since the photos in google image search are displayed as thumbnails , no new work is created , which leaves no justification for displaying the copywrited works without permission , the court ruled .
" it does n't matter that thumbnails are much smaller than original pictures and are displayed in a lower resolution , " the court said in its ruling .
artists complain google 's image search function brings up often millions of thumbnails of photographs , pictures and other graphics culled from internet sites .
google always has a disclaimed next to images that they might be scaled down and also might be subject to copyright .
but for some that is not enough .
they do not want their images to show up in the search engine at all .
german photographer michael bernhard and artist thomas horn brought cases against google in germany to protest the display of their copyrighted images .
horn , whose comic drawings were displayed on google , has reportedly asked for about 1,300 euros plus interest to compensate for his " stolen pictures . "
google likely to appeal if the ruling ends up keeping all copyrighted images from being displayed in google , that " capitulates us into the digital stone age , " kay oberbeck , spokeswoman for google germany was quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper as saying .
google will appeal the ruling , the newspaper reported .
but if it is upheld , it could mean that google would have to turn off its image search function , the hamburger abendblatt reported .

13 ahead of a major eu summit in brussels . " of course we understand that in financially difficult moments governments become defensive , but it is our duty to call the attention of governments and the public to responsibility , " european commission chief jose manuel barroso told journalists .
the eu has been " driving " the global climate debate , but there will be a " real problem of credibility for europe at a time when we expect others to come closer to our position " if the bloc weakens its own targets , he warned .
in march 2007 eu leaders pledged to cut the bloc 's emissions of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 , the gas most linked with global warming -rrb- to 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 .

the german book prize recognizes novels with a broad international appeal .
there is a three-step selection process in which a panel of judges select 20 titles , six of which are then short-listed .
tellkamp 's nearly 1,000-page tome is about the disintegration of former east germany , leading to the collapse of the communist regime in 1989 .
the semi-autobiographical saga spans three generations of a of an elite group of dresden intellectuals and artists living in an ivory tower high above the baroque city that was once called the florence of the elbe and demolished by allied bombs at the end of the war .

russian negotiators said they would not show up unless the two regions , which russia has recognized as independent nations , had a seat at the table for the talks scheduled for wednesday in the swiss capital .
" without them , we wo n't go to geneva , " deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said in a statement .
but before boarding a plane to geneva , the head of the georgian delegation said : " the georgian side will not allow it .
" representatives from abkhazia and the so-called south ossetia will not take part in negotiations in geneva , " deputy foreign minister grigol vashadze was quoted by news agency interfax as saying .
moscow flew in the face of western criticism and recognized the two regions as independent after routing a georgian offensive to take back control over south ossetia in august .
both have been self- governed since breaking from tbilisi 's rule in the early 1990s .
the disagreement means high-level negotiations to smooth out an eu- brokered ceasefire have devolved into " technical meetings " at the expert level , as a un spokesman put it .

13 , in a ceremony that precludes the frankfurt book fair , the world 's premier publishing event .
the german book prize recognizes novels with a broad international appeal .
there is a three-step selection process in which a panel of judges select 20 titles , six of which are then short-listed .
tellkamp 's nearly 1,000-page tome is about the disintegration of former east germany , leading to the collapse of the communist regime in 1989 .
the semi-autobiographical saga spans three generations of a of an elite group of dresden intellectuals and artists living in an ivory tower high above the baroque city that was once called the florence of the elbe and demolished by allied bombs at the end of the war .
the main protagonist , who is the son of a doctor and a nurse , rebels against the system as the novel traverses east german literary circles , political institutions , schools and clinics .
author jailed in communist east germany tellkamp , 39 , is a medical doctor who wrote " der turm " between hospital shifts .
he was born in dresden and jailed for his " political unreliability " just before the communist regime dissolved and germany was reunified .
afterwards , tellkamp embarked on his medical studies in newyork and the eastern german city of leipzig before working as a doctor in a dresden clinic .
bildunterschrift : the former eastern baroque city of dresden is the backdrop of an epic that spans three generations tellkamp has published one other novel , a thriller called " der eisvogel " -lrb- the kingfisher -rrb- that was hailed by literary critics but had a first run of only 163 copies .
he also writes poetry and lives in freiburg where he now writes full-time .
book critics were full of praise for " der turm , " but warned that the book is not light reading with its ponderous metaphors and poetic style .
some said he could one day be recognized as a " great german author . "
experiencing history through literature sabine franke of the german daily frankfurter rundschau said that the novel " is not about uncovering facts , but about experiencing history through literature .
this is a book for insiders -lrb- former east germans -rrb- , for those who remember , who were there themselves .
but at the same time , it is a book for posterity and parallel worlds , for those who come after and for whom this moment in history can only be contemplated from the outside . "
the five other finalists were dietmar dath for " die abschaffung der arten " -lrb- " the abolition of the species " -rrb- ; sherko fatah for " das dunkle schiff " -lrb- " the dark ship " -rrb- ; iris hanika for " treffen sich zwei " -lrb- " when two meet " -rrb- ; rolf lappert for " nach hause schwimmen " -lrb- " swimming home " -rrb- ; and ingo schulze for " adam und evelyn " -lrb- " adam and evelyn " -rrb- .
tellkamp was awarded 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 dollars -rrb- in prize money and the runners-up were each awarded 2,500 euros .
the german book prize showcases young and upcoming literary talent , launching them on the international scene .
last year 's winner was julia franck , whose novel " die mittagsfrau " has already been translated into several languages . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ahead of the summit , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that europe and the rest of the world must rethink financial regulation and supervisory rules , including for hedge funds and private equity , once the crisis subsides .
he said he was encouraged by stock market surges following sunday 's adoption of a coordinated 2.2 trillion euro -lrb- $ 3,023 billion -rrb- rescue plan for banks in eurozone countries .

ireland to report on lisbon treaty finally , the summit is set to hear a report from the irish government on the country 's rejection of the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 .

but in ireland , many voters reported feeling confused and poorly informed about the consequences of the referendum .
there were fears that voting " yes " to the treaty would lead to ireland 's arm being twisted on such sensitive issues as military neutrality and abortion rights .
ahead of the summit , european commission vice president margot wallstroem told the irish times that she has warned member states not to push ireland into a decision about whether to hold a second referendum .
" the irish should not be forced or pushed or pressed into taking a decision that they do n't feel ready for , " she said .
she added that rumors that eu politicians would move ahead without ireland were " unrealistic . "
" there might be those who will want to go ahead on their own , but i think it is totally unrealistic , " wallstroem said .

ahead of the summit , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that europe and the rest of the world must rethink financial regulation and supervisory rules , including for hedge funds and private equity , once the crisis subsides .
he said he was encouraged by stock market surges following sunday 's adoption of a coordinated 2.2 trillion euro -lrb- $ 3,023 billion -rrb- rescue plan for banks in eurozone countries .
" once we have put financial markets back on their feet , we must ensure that in the future , they function properly for the benefit of citizens and businesses , rather than themselves , " barroso said .
german news agency dpa has reported that diplomats expect the eu summit to throw its weight behind the euro-group decision rather than proposing new measures .

russia withdrew from " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia on oct .
9 , but has more than doubled its troop presence in the regions , occupying formerly georgian-held positions there .
this has left eu states at odds over whether conditions for restarting the talks have been fulfilled .
" for me , it 's clear that we have to start the negotiations because the spirit of the agreement has been fulfilled , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 14.10.2008 daimler to slash us jobs as vw bucks economic downturn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler production lines in the us and canada are being closed and moved to mexico german auto giant daimler will eliminate 3,500 north american jobs owing to the worsening economic slowdown .
vw , however , bucked the downward trend and set record highs for its shares on the stock market . following announcements by nissan , renault , and volvo in europe , and restructuring by general motors and ford , utility vehicles are also unveiling hits from slumping sales .
in the united states , the market deteriorated " in a way we have not anticipated , " daimler trucks boss andreas renschler told a telephone press conference .
he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .
" as the recession deepens , the heavy-truck market is hit harder , " german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer told reporters .
" the sector will see a recession as well . "
in addition , a daimler spokeswoman told reporters , the sector is subject to regular cycles , and the german group had already expected diminished demand late this year and early in 2009 .
" it is falling back more sharply now , " she noted however .
finally , new us regulations aimed at reducing pollution have also hurt sales , daimler said .
the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .
production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .
first of all , vw is in the process of being taken over by porsche , the maker of luxury sports cars like the 911 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .
as the deadline for porsche 's takeover approaches , those banks must make sure they own the shares in question .
brokers have said banks probably waited until the last minute in a bet that vw shares would fall because of the financial crisis and might be scrambling now to cover their positions .
mystery surrounds investors another hypothesis is that speculative investment funds may have targeted vw shares with the practice of short selling , in which they borrow shares that are immediately sold in expectation of being able to repurchase them later at a cheaper price before they must be returned to the original owner .
if that were the case , funds could also be buying heavily to make sure they can return the vw stock without suffering even heavier losses .
" people must unwind short positions because they are losing money , " baader bank strategist robert halver told reporters .
but in the end , even market specialists say that " no one knows who is holding the positions , who the speculative funds might be , who is buying or selling for porsche , " in the words of bhf-bank analyst albrecht denninghoff .
" we do not know how many people are on board the ship .
" there is no transparency in the markets .
at that point , anything is possible . "
halver goes even further , saying that even funds caught short trying to profit from short selling would not fully explain vw 's soaring share price .
" it is just not possible , " he said .
" bafin should open an investigation , " halver added in reference to germany 's financial market regulator .
a spokeswoman for the market watchdog told the afp news agency it is examining the data .
“ it is not a formal investigation , " she added . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential porsche takeover could have helped vw porsche currently owns more than 35 percent of the shares in its much bigger german counterpart , and has indicated it will reach 50 percent by the end of november .
but porsche insists it is not presently buying vw shares on the market .
a persistent rumor has it that someone is doing the trading on porsche 's behalf .
for several months , porsche has held options to buy vw shares that it obtained in deals with banks .
as the deadline for porsche 's takeover approaches , those banks must make sure they own the shares in question .
brokers have said banks probably waited until the last minute in a bet that vw shares would fall because of the financial crisis and might be scrambling now to cover their positions .
mystery surrounds investors another hypothesis is that speculative investment funds may have targeted vw shares with the practice of short selling , in which they borrow shares that are immediately sold in expectation of being able to repurchase them later at a cheaper price before they must be returned to the original owner .
if that were the case , funds could also be buying heavily to make sure they can return the vw stock without suffering even heavier losses .
" people must unwind short positions because they are losing money , " baader bank strategist robert halver told reporters .
but in the end , even market specialists say that " no one knows who is holding the positions , who the speculative funds might be , who is buying or selling for porsche , " in the words of bhf-bank analyst albrecht denninghoff .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 14.10.2008 daimler to slash us jobs as vw bucks economic downturn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler production lines in the us and canada are being closed and moved to mexico german auto giant daimler will eliminate 3,500 north american jobs owing to the worsening economic slowdown .
vw , however , bucked the downward trend and set record highs for its shares on the stock market . following announcements by nissan , renault , and volvo in europe , and restructuring by general motors and ford , utility vehicles are also unveiling hits from slumping sales .
in the united states , the market deteriorated " in a way we have not anticipated , " daimler trucks boss andreas renschler told a telephone press conference .
he pointed to weaker demand , a " dramatic " increase in fuel and raw material prices earlier this year and effects of the international financial crisis .
the sector was undergoing fundamental changes , renschler said , and " a near-term recovery is not on the horizon . "
daimler , the world 's biggest maker of heavy trucks , decided to shut down its sterling trucks brand in march " in response to continuing depressed demand across the industry and structural changes in the company 's core markets , " a statement said .
the german group is a rare european actor in the north american heavy truck sector , with about 28 percent of the market and sales of 320,000 vehicles in 2007 .
as a result however , it has suffered from the financial and economic crisis there , and has slashed its previous market forecast for 2008 sales of 435,000 heavy trucks down to 294,000 .
" as the recession deepens , the heavy-truck market is hit harder , " german auto expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer told reporters .
" the sector will see a recession as well . "
in addition , a daimler spokeswoman told reporters , the sector is subject to regular cycles , and the german group had already expected diminished demand late this year and early in 2009 .
" it is falling back more sharply now , " she noted however .
finally , new us regulations aimed at reducing pollution have also hurt sales , daimler said .
the group will eliminate around one quarter of its workforce in north american heavy truck production , based on figures it provided .
production at shut-down plants moving to mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler trucks will be made south of the border two plants are to be shut down , one in ontario , canada in march , and another in portland , oregon in june 2010 , and production will move to mexico .
with pressure to reduce production costs rising , daimler would focus on " low-cost countries , " renschler said .
in addition to the loss of 2,300 jobs , another 1,200 administrative posts will also be eliminated , the daimler statement said .
after unloading the sterling trucks brand , daimler will concentrate on its freightliner and western star models .
" sterling and freightliner occupy the same -lrb- market -rrb- segment .
but freightliner has stronger sales and is our top-of-the-line , " the daimler spokeswoman said .
the group estimates its restructuring will cost around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 820 million -rrb- , but will generate annual savings of 900 million from 2011 .
" daimler is trying to limit its losses in the united states , " dudenhoeffer concluded , though he added that the market should " pick up again in 2010 . "
it is likely meanwhile to shift towards emerging economies in eastern europe , india and china .
" there are almost no other means of transporting merchandise there , " dudenhoeffer said .
in general , he concluded , " logistics is clearly a growth industry ; it is expanding twice as fast as the market for personal vehicles . "
vw shares hit record high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up in the clouds : vw shares have hit the heights in contrast to the bad news at daimler , volkswagen shares have set record highs while almost all other stocks are slammed by the financial crisis .
" there is no rational explanation , " said juergen pieper , an analyst with the metzler bank amid heavy trading in the auto giant 's shares .
merck finck counterpart robert heberger agreed , saying in reference to the group 's share price : " there is no longer any relation to its real value . "
last week , as the credit crisis spilled financial blood on stock markets worldwide , shares in the biggest european carmaker took off in frankfurt , hitting an intraday record high on tuesday of 452 euros -lrb- $ 605 -rrb- .
though the shares later dived lower , on friday , while the german dax index of leading shares plunged by 7.01 percent , vw gained an incredible 15.2 percent to close at a record 342 euros .
vw shares gained another 3.23 percent amid general market euphoria on monday to a new record 353.06 euros .
as a result , vw has passed japanese rival toyota as the biggest car maker in the world in terms of market capitalization , at more than 90 billion euros , compared with around 80 billion for the asian giant .
what is all the more surprising is that the auto sector is one of the most exposed to turmoil from the financial crisis .
vw has done better than many competitors , with sales tipped to set new records this year , " but when we are in a recession , it is going to suffer as well , " heberger noted .
pieper added : " vw 's true share value is around half " the present level .
" they are also going to cut production and the boss has already warned that 2009 will be difficult , " he said .
special circumstances attributed to vw boost explanations for the stock 's health thus lies elsewhere .

the gloomy news was a sharp contrast to a strong showing by european stock markets on tuesday . the world financial crisis will bring germany 's economic growth nearly to a halt , according to a twice-yearly economic report released in berlin .
the economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2009 to just 0.2 percent .
previously , the institutes had projected 1.4 percent growth .
germany is expected to finish out 2008 with an overall growth rate of 1.8 percent .
" the german economy is on the edge of a recession , " said udo ludwig from the iwh economic institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends on high-end exports for its well-being germany , the world 's leading export nation , faces a sharp fall in foreign demand as the world economy slows .
the weaker growth outlook could result in job losses of 400,000 in germany next year , the institutes also warned .
germany 's economy ministry will unveil its own growth estimates on thursday , which are also expected to be revised sharply lower .
investor confidence plunges these growth rates make up the economists ' " basic scenario . "
but in view of the exceptionally high level of uncertainty brought by the international financial crisis , the economists also drew up a more pessimistic " risk scenario . "
in this scenario , the german economy would actually contract by 0.8 percent next year .
but the experts said they do expect the economy to stabilize by the end of 2009 , according to the report .
the institutes participating in the study include ifo in munich , ifw in kiel , rwi in essen and iwh in halle , together with the austrian think tanks wifo and ihs and switzerland 's kof .
germany 's zew index of financial sector confidence , also released tuesday , plunged this month .
however , the institute said it would likely rebound following a major european bank rescue plan announced sunday .
the indicator fell by 21.9 points to minus 63.0 points , the second lowest level since the start of the survey in december 1991 .
the zew economic research institute said its results had been gathered in the heat of the international financial crisis .
france , britain also struggling germany is n't alone in looking ahead to tough economic times .
the bank of france predicted growth will drop to minus 0.1 percent in the third quarter , showing the country was heading into recession after a 0.3 percent contraction in the previous three months , according to a report released tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stock market has been on a wild ride britain 's inflation rate was also reported to have reached a 16-year high of 5.2 percent in september , afp news agency reported tuesday .
britain 's statistics office said higher gas and electricity costs have fueled the increases .
the inflation level is more than double the government 's 2 percent target .
economists said they believe inflation will level off and return to the target level by the end of 2009 .
stocks soar on rescue plan the dour outlook was in sharp contrast to stock price increases around europe .
investors took comfort in the coordinated european bank rescue plans announced monday .
in morning deals on tuesday , european shares rose nearly 5 percent .
frankfurt was trading 3.14 percent higher early on tuesday .

the gloomy news was a sharp contrast to a strong showing by european stock markets on tuesday . the world financial crisis will bring germany 's economic growth nearly to a halt , according to a twice-yearly economic report released in berlin .
the economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2009 to just 0.2 percent .
previously , the institutes had projected 1.4 percent growth .
germany is expected to finish out 2008 with an overall growth rate of 1.8 percent .
" the german economy is on the edge of a recession , " said udo ludwig from the iwh economic institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany depends on high-end exports for its well-being germany , the world 's leading export nation , faces a sharp fall in foreign demand as the world economy slows .
the weaker growth outlook could result in job losses of 400,000 in germany next year , the institutes also warned .
germany 's economy ministry will unveil its own growth estimates on thursday , which are also expected to be revised sharply lower .
investor confidence plunges these growth rates make up the economists ' " basic scenario . "
but in view of the exceptionally high level of uncertainty brought by the international financial crisis , the economists also drew up a more pessimistic " risk scenario . "
in this scenario , the german economy would actually contract by 0.8 percent next year .
but the experts said they do expect the economy to stabilize by the end of 2009 , according to the report .
the institutes participating in the study include ifo in munich , ifw in kiel , rwi in essen and iwh in halle , together with the austrian think tanks wifo and ihs and switzerland 's kof .
germany 's zew index of financial sector confidence , also released tuesday , plunged this month .
however , the institute said it would likely rebound following a major european bank rescue plan announced sunday .
the indicator fell by 21.9 points to minus 63.0 points , the second lowest level since the start of the survey in december 1991 .
the zew economic research institute said its results had been gathered in the heat of the international financial crisis .
france , britain also struggling germany is n't alone in looking ahead to tough economic times .
the bank of france predicted growth will drop to minus 0.1 percent in the third quarter , showing the country was heading into recession after a 0.3 percent contraction in the previous three months , according to a report released tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stock market has been on a wild ride britain 's inflation rate was also reported to have reached a 16-year high of 5.2 percent in september , afp news agency reported tuesday .
britain 's statistics office said higher gas and electricity costs have fueled the increases .
the inflation level is more than double the government 's 2 percent target .
economists said they believe inflation will level off and return to the target level by the end of 2009 .
stocks soar on rescue plan the dour outlook was in sharp contrast to stock price increases around europe .

13 , postponed any decision to resume partnership talks with russia amid disagreements over whether moscow has complied with a peace deal in georgia . meeting in luxembourg , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states " noted with satisfaction that ...
russian troops have withdrawn from the zones adjacent to -lrb- the georgian breakaway regions of -rrb- south ossetia and abkhazia , " a joint statement said .
however , while the move is " an essential additional step " in the implementation of an eu-sponsored peace plan , the ministers " called on the parties to implement their commitments , " including by giving access to eu and un observers , the statement said .
the decision dashes the hopes of those eu member states which had said that russia 's withdrawal from the so-called " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions was enough for the bloc to re-open talks on a wide-ranging strategic deal .
ahead of the meeting , germany and italy stressed that it was " in the eu 's interest " to re-open talks on a successor to the current eu-russia partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many russian troops have pulled out but some remain german deputy foreign minister guenter gloser said , " there will always be some people who think the eu is doing russia a favor " with the negotiations .
but we must ask whether -lrb- the eu -rrb- would be doing itself a favor by blocking relations , given , in particular , the importance of russian fuel supplies to europe . "
and the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , proposed that ministers respond to russia 's pull-out by agreeing to re-launch talks in november .
but that proposal fell foul of resistance from eu states such as britain , poland , sweden and the baltic states , who argued that russia had not pulled its troops back to the positions they occupied before war with georgia broke out on aug .
7 , as eu leaders had demanded .
" they have made some withdrawals , primarily from the buffer zones , but there are areas which they are occupying now where they were not on aug .
7 , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said on his arrival in luxembourg .
" we have to take it fairly slowly , " added finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who currently chairs the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
russian troops allegedly still in georgia on thursday , osce monitors said moscow had pulled its forces out of the buffer zones adjacent to the separatist enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia , one day ahead of the oct .
10 deadline brokered by the eu .
but osce officials also said russian troops were still present in the akhalgori area of georgia , and french foreign minister bernard kouchner on monday acknowledged that " problems remain . "
those problems dominated talks , with ministers agreeing to make no move until they see how events unfold on the ground in georgia and how russia behaves in international talks on the crisis , set to open in geneva on wednesday .
" in due course we can address the pca -lrb- successor -rrb- , " british foreign minister david miliband said , " but at the moment we should be focusing on ensuring that all the elements that were agreed in september , including the geneva talks , get going with proper speed . "
bildunterschrift : from left , eu foreign policy chief javier solana , european commission president jose manuel barroso , french president nicolas sarkozy , russian president dmitry medvedev luxembourg 's jean asselborn acknowledged that a decision on re-starting the post-pca talks would not likely be made much before an eu-russia summit , due to take place on nov .
14 in nice .
" one solution could be to wait for the -lrb- european -rrb- commission 's report and then start the negotiations before the nov , 14 summit , " asselborn said .
some parts of agreement still unfulfilled kouchner noted that the ceasefire deal ending the russia-georgia conflict in august was not being entirely respected .
while still contesting russia 's backing for breakaway georgian territories south ossetia and abkhazia , the ministers are expected to decide that russia has kept its commitments by withdrawing troops from a buffer zone around the contested territories .
kouchner reaffirmed that russia had withdrawn its troops from buffer zones near the two breakaway georgian regions , in line with a french-brokered ceasefire agreement .
" the russians have withdrawn , and apart from south ossetia and abkhazia , there are no more russia soldiers in georgia , " he said .
" we postponed " the partnership negotiations at an emergency summit on georgia on sept .
1 , called after russia recognized the independence of rebel abkhazia and south ossetia , he recalled .
but he said that of the six-points in the peace agreement reached on aug .
12 between french president nicolas sarkozy and his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev , " we have fulfilled between two and three " points .

ahead of the summit , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that europe and the rest of the world must rethink financial regulation and supervisory rules , including for hedge funds and private equity , once the crisis subsides .
he said he was encouraged by stock market surges following sunday 's adoption of a coordinated 2.2 trillion euro -lrb- $ 3,023 billion -rrb- rescue plan for banks in eurozone countries .
" once we have put financial markets back on their feet , we must ensure that in the future , they function properly for the benefit of citizens and businesses , rather than themselves , " barroso said .
german news agency dpa has reported that diplomats expect the eu summit to throw its weight behind the euro-group decision rather than proposing new measures .
mending ties with russia the second crisis on the eu 's agenda ?
whether or not it should re-open talks with russia on a key strategic partnership which were frozen in the wake of the summer 's russian-georgian war .
at an emergency summit on sept .
1 , leaders agreed there would be no further talks " until troops have withdrawn to the positions held prior to aug .
7 , " the day that fighting began .
russia withdrew from " buffer zones " outside georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia on oct .
9 , but has more than doubled its troop presence in the regions , occupying formerly georgian-held positions there .
this has left eu states at odds over whether conditions for restarting the talks have been fulfilled .
" for me , it 's clear that we have to start the negotiations because the spirit of the agreement has been fulfilled , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
but swedish foreign minister carl bildt disagreed .
" if you look at the maps , -lrb- the russians -rrb- are not back to the positions they held prior to aug .
7 , " he said .
ireland to report on lisbon treaty finally , the summit is set to hear a report from the irish government on the country 's rejection of the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 .
the " no " vote threw the bloc into institutional panic as the treaty can not come into effect without being ratified by every member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit will give ireland another chance to express itself the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the eu 's institutions and increase efficiency and transparency to voters .
but in ireland , many voters reported feeling confused and poorly informed about the consequences of the referendum .
there were fears that voting " yes " to the treaty would lead to ireland 's arm being twisted on such sensitive issues as military neutrality and abortion rights .
ahead of the summit , european commission vice president margot wallstroem told the irish times that she has warned member states not to push ireland into a decision about whether to hold a second referendum .
" the irish should not be forced or pushed or pressed into taking a decision that they do n't feel ready for , " she said .
she added that rumors that eu politicians would move ahead without ireland were " unrealistic . "
" there might be those who will want to go ahead on their own , but i think it is totally unrealistic , " wallstroem said .
" nobody wants to see ireland out of the eu and that is certainly not the wish of the irish people . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mp3 players and mobile phones cranked up to high volumes are the main culprits , a study by european scientists shows . any more than five hours of loud music through headphones has the potential to cause permanent hearing loss , according to a study done for the european commission , the european union 's executive arm .
the study said that children and teenagers need to be protected from " leisure noise . "
loud mobile phones were also criticized .
" there has been increasing concern about exposure from the new generation of personal music players which can reproduce sounds at very high volumes without loss of quality , " the commission said in a statement .
young people pose special risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stop the noise !
experts estimated that between 50 and 100 million europeans listen to portable music players on a daily basis .
if those players are cranked up to more than 89 decibels for five hours a week , the resulting noise would exceed eu limits for workplace noise .
if listened to for longer periods , hearing damage is a concern .
between 5 and 10 percent of listeners - 10 million europeans - are in danger of having hearing loss , according to the study .
" i am concerned that so many young people ... who are frequent users of personal music players and mobile phones at high acoustic levels , may be unknowingly damaging their hearing irrevocably , " meglena kuneva , the eu 's consumer affairs commissioner , said in the statement . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german photographer and an artist won lawsuits against google for displaying thumbnails of their works in search results without permission .
google will reportedly appeal the ruling . google can not display copyrighted works as thumbnails without an owner 's permission , a court in the northern german city of hamburg ruled on tuesday , oct 14 .
since the photos in google image search are displayed as thumbnails , no new work is created , which leaves no justification for displaying the copywrited works without permission , the court ruled .
" it does n't matter that thumbnails are much smaller than original pictures and are displayed in a lower resolution , " the court said in its ruling .
artists complain google 's image search function brings up often millions of thumbnails of photographs , pictures and other graphics culled from internet sites .
google always has a disclaimed next to images that they might be scaled down and also might be subject to copyright .
but for some that is not enough .
they do not want their images to show up in the search engine at all .
german photographer michael bernhard and artist thomas horn brought cases against google in germany to protest the display of their copyrighted images .
horn , whose comic drawings were displayed on google , has reportedly asked for about 1,300 euros plus interest to compensate for his " stolen pictures . "
google likely to appeal if the ruling ends up keeping all copyrighted images from being displayed in google , that " capitulates us into the digital stone age , " kay oberbeck , spokeswoman for google germany was quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper as saying .
google will appeal the ruling , the newspaper reported .
but if it is upheld , it could mean that google would have to turn off its image search function , the hamburger abendblatt reported .
the court suggested that google replace thumbnails of pictures with a text describing them , something google said is not a practical , user-friendly solution . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the long term , it could mean more eu-wide regulation . recent days have seen european governments galloping to the rescue of struggling banks , approving mergers and announcing billion-euro bailouts .
in the process , they 've threatened to ride roughshod over the european union 's strict limits on state aid to the private sector .
that is the view of neelie kroes , the commissioner in charge of competition for the eu , who used the wild west analogy in a sharply-worded speech in brussels on monday , oct .
13 .
an anything-goes atmosphere would be a “ recipe for chaos , ” kroes warned .
yet it ’ s unlikely that europe ’ s financial crisis will turn into a spaghetti western .
in the long run , the banking crisis will likely mean more unity in europe ’ s financial sector , say leading economists and eu banking experts .
in crisis mode bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current crisis has been likened to the wild west the top priority for eu leaders in recent days has been to unfreeze the credit markets .
all other concerns have taken a back seat .
more than a half dozen european countries announced bailout plans monday , with germany alone putting together a rescue package worth as much as 500 billion euros -lrb- $ 671 billion -rrb- .
“ the agenda is dominated by crisis management .
everything is suspended until we 're out of the crisis , ” iain begg , an expert on eu policies and fiscal issues at the london school of economics , told deutsche welle .
yet after the immediate crisis stabilizes , europe will need to take a broader look at its banking sector .
improving competition and regulation were issues before the crisis and now have become even more so , begg and others said .
finding a solution even as european governments announced 1.4 trillion euros in guarantees and other emergency measures , they stopped short of a one-size-fits-all bailout .
specific actions were left up to individual countries and no europe-wide fund has been established to help other countries ' troubled banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are calls for large banks to be regulated differently still , that level of unity was remarkable for the euro area , said nicolas veron of bruegel , a european think tank devoted to international economics . “ what is sure is that the europeans have reacted quickly to the crisis and that was not a foregone conclusion , ” veron told deutsche welle .
european markets reacted positively , jumping 9 percent on monday.the hope is that government guarantees will help banks overcome their reluctance to lend money to one another .
opening up competition yet veron cautioned against the idea that the road ahead would be easy .
“ what was announced yesterday will not magically solve all the problems , ” veron said .
“ the implementation will be very difficult . ”
a few hours after offering up her wild west criticism , kroes made public rules for eu member states to follow when rescuing banks .
all banks which operate in a country have to be covered by guarantees , kroes said .
this is an implied criticism of ireland , which on sept .
30 proposed covering only deposits in irish-owned banks .
the government has since revised the proposal to include non-irish banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has promised 500 billion euros “ we 've had problems with competition in europe for a long time .
most european bank markets are heavily dominated by national firms , ” said fredrik erixon , the director of the european center for international political economy -lrb- ecipe -rrb- , a think tank dedicated to trade and other international issues of importance to europe . yet multinational banks pose their own set of problems , erixon and others point out .
who would pick up the bill for bailing out the british subsidiary , say , of spain 's banco santander ?
or who would come to the rescue of the spanish arm of deutsche bank ? and would it be enough to tighten regulations on european banks ?
erixon said the worry is that people would then shift investments to asia and the us where regulations did n't exist . economists just do n't know exactly what the upcoming days and months will bring . “ we are still in the phase of crisis reaction , ” erixon said .

13 , in a ceremony that precludes the frankfurt book fair , the world 's premier publishing event .
the german book prize recognizes novels with a broad international appeal .
there is a three-step selection process in which a panel of judges select 20 titles , six of which are then short-listed .
tellkamp 's nearly 1,000-page tome is about the disintegration of former east germany , leading to the collapse of the communist regime in 1989 .
the semi-autobiographical saga spans three generations of a of an elite group of dresden intellectuals and artists living in an ivory tower high above the baroque city that was once called the florence of the elbe and demolished by allied bombs at the end of the war .
the main protagonist , who is the son of a doctor and a nurse , rebels against the system as the novel traverses east german literary circles , political institutions , schools and clinics .
author jailed in communist east germany tellkamp , 39 , is a medical doctor who wrote " der turm " between hospital shifts .
he was born in dresden and jailed for his " political unreliability " just before the communist regime dissolved and germany was reunified .
afterwards , tellkamp embarked on his medical studies in newyork and the eastern german city of leipzig before working as a doctor in a dresden clinic .
bildunterschrift : the former eastern baroque city of dresden is the backdrop of an epic that spans three generations tellkamp has published one other novel , a thriller called " der eisvogel " -lrb- the kingfisher -rrb- that was hailed by literary critics but had a first run of only 163 copies .
he also writes poetry and lives in freiburg where he now writes full-time .
book critics were full of praise for " der turm , " but warned that the book is not light reading with its ponderous metaphors and poetic style .
some said he could one day be recognized as a " great german author . "
experiencing history through literature sabine franke of the german daily frankfurter rundschau said that the novel " is not about uncovering facts , but about experiencing history through literature .
this is a book for insiders -lrb- former east germans -rrb- , for those who remember , who were there themselves .
but at the same time , it is a book for posterity and parallel worlds , for those who come after and for whom this moment in history can only be contemplated from the outside . "
the five other finalists were dietmar dath for " die abschaffung der arten " -lrb- " the abolition of the species " -rrb- ; sherko fatah for " das dunkle schiff " -lrb- " the dark ship " -rrb- ; iris hanika for " treffen sich zwei " -lrb- " when two meet " -rrb- ; rolf lappert for " nach hause schwimmen " -lrb- " swimming home " -rrb- ; and ingo schulze for " adam und evelyn " -lrb- " adam and evelyn " -rrb- .
tellkamp was awarded 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 dollars -rrb- in prize money and the runners-up were each awarded 2,500 euros .
the german book prize showcases young and upcoming literary talent , launching them on the international scene .
last year 's winner was julia franck , whose novel " die mittagsfrau " has already been translated into several languages . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german photographer and an artist won lawsuits against google for displaying thumbnails of their works in search results without permission .
google will reportedly appeal the ruling . google can not display copyrighted works as thumbnails without an owner 's permission , a court in the northern german city of hamburg ruled on tuesday , oct 14 .
since the photos in google image search are displayed as thumbnails , no new work is created , which leaves no justification for displaying the copywrited works without permission , the court ruled .
" it does n't matter that thumbnails are much smaller than original pictures and are displayed in a lower resolution , " the court said in its ruling .
artists complain google 's image search function brings up often millions of thumbnails of photographs , pictures and other graphics culled from internet sites .
google always has a disclaimed next to images that they might be scaled down and also might be subject to copyright .
but for some that is not enough .
they do not want their images to show up in the search engine at all .
german photographer michael bernhard and artist thomas horn brought cases against google in germany to protest the display of their copyrighted images .
horn , whose comic drawings were displayed on google , has reportedly asked for about 1,300 euros plus interest to compensate for his " stolen pictures . "
google likely to appeal if the ruling ends up keeping all copyrighted images from being displayed in google , that " capitulates us into the digital stone age , " kay oberbeck , spokeswoman for google germany was quoted by the hamburger abendblatt newspaper as saying .
google will appeal the ruling , the newspaper reported .
but if it is upheld , it could mean that google would have to turn off its image search function , the hamburger abendblatt reported .
the court suggested that google replace thumbnails of pictures with a text describing them , something google said is not a practical , user-friendly solution . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jersey is not part of the uk , makes most of its own laws and is much closer to france than it is to britain .
normandy is 14 miles -lrb- 23km -rrb- away , dorset 100 miles -lrb- 161km -rrb- .
" if you wanted to get to the french coast from here , you 'd be there in 12 to 14 minutes in a fast speedboat , " senator jimmy perchard said .
" you can literally go there for lunch . "
" a continental lifestyle is desirable - we 'd have the opportunity to spend longer out in the evenings " senator jimmy perchard mr perchard , who sits in the island 's parliament , the states , wants jersey 's time zone to change .
standing on the edge of a field of one of the island 's most famous exports - the jersey royal potato - the senator points out landmarks as we survey the picturesque coastline .
in front of us is the imposing castle of mont orgueil , built around 1204 to protect the island from the french .
but for those now wanting to switch to french time , gallic cultural influences are welcome .
" the french mainland is just over my shoulder , " senator perchard said .
" we have historical connections with france .
our streets have french names .
the prayers in our parliament are in french .
" a continental lifestyle is desirable - we 'd have the opportunity to spend longer out in the evenings .
it 's something that jersey could market and promote for tourists as well as enjoy for itself . "
financial risk not everyone is convinced though .
the biggest employer in jersey is the finance industry .
jersey sets its own taxes , and the competitive rates have attracted £ 220bn in deposits at 48 banks . "
the majority of the industry are against it because it would get us in a situation where we 're not in line with our major trading partner , london " geoff cook , jersey finance limited the organisation that represents the industry , jersey finance limited , has asked its members what they make of the proposed time zone change .
they are less than enthusiastic - with at least 70 % opposed to the idea .
the umbrella group 's headquarters have a corporate feel .
but for the panoramic coastal view , you could be in a boardroom in the city of london .
chief executive geoff cook acknowledges the benefits switching times could bring in terms of quality of life to islanders but says , on balance , most of his members are against the proposed change .
" we do n't believe it 's right - the majority of the industry are against it because it would disrupt business and get us in a situation where we 're not in line with our major trading partner , london , " he said .
" we would n't be able to start work till 1000 and you would have different lunch hours .
" in addition , in the current global climate we believe it 's just a risk we should n't be taking - a distraction we do n't need . "
cattle trouble for the island 's farmers , it is also the practicalities of a change that make many of them wary .
john le maistre , president of the jersey farmers union , has a herd of 90 jersey cows .
as we found out when we met him before sunrise , attempting to round up the cattle for milking in close to pitch darkness requires more than a torch .
a healthy dose of luck helps .
an extra hour of darkness does not .
" the cows are used to being milked so they will be making their way there , but there are always one or two stragglers , " he said .
" and you need to be able to see them .
in the dark , bluntly , you ca n't . "
meanwhile , in the uk , campaigners are watching the referendum with keen interest .
switching time zones has been on the political agenda for decades , but not far enough up it for those who would like to see a change .
crash statistics documents from the home office acknowledge that during the experiment with cet in the uk between 1968 and 1971 , there was a fall in the number of people killed in road accidents . "
if they make a positive decision in favour of daylight saving it 'll force the uk into a position where it 'll have to consider making this decision itself " tom mullarkey , royal society for the prevention of accidents it is argued 100 deaths a year could be prevented because statistics suggest the extra crashes caused by dark mornings are more than offset by the reduction in collisions in the lighter evenings .
reason enough for the change to become permanent across the uk , according to the royal society for the prevention of accidents .
chief executive tom mullarkey said : " i think the people of jersey are in a tremendous position to show leadership here - if they make a positive decision in favour of daylight saving it 'll force the uk into a position where it 'll have to consider making this decision itself . "
such a change could mean the sun would not rise in parts of scotland until nearly 1000 in the winter , and , for the time being at least , the government is not convinced a change would be a positive move .
but the broader debate has been reinvigorated .
whatever the result of jersey 's referendum , just a few weeks before the clocks in the uk are turned back an hour , the question is being asked again .
should all of the british isles synchronise watches with the likes of france and germany and change the clocks for good ?

by chris mason bbc news , jersey senator perchard would welcome gallic time in jersey people in jersey are preparing to go to the polls on wednesday to have their say on whether the channel island should continue to use british time or sign up to central european time -lrb- cet -rrb- instead - one hour ahead of the uk .
jersey is not part of the uk , makes most of its own laws and is much closer to france than it is to britain .
normandy is 14 miles -lrb- 23km -rrb- away , dorset 100 miles -lrb- 161km -rrb- .
" if you wanted to get to the french coast from here , you 'd be there in 12 to 14 minutes in a fast speedboat , " senator jimmy perchard said .
" you can literally go there for lunch . "
a continental lifestyle is desirable - we 'd have the opportunity to spend longer out in the evenings senator jimmy perchard mr perchard , who sits in the island 's parliament , the states , wants jersey 's time zone to change .
standing on the edge of a field of one of the island 's most famous exports - the jersey royal potato - the senator points out landmarks as we survey the picturesque coastline .
in front of us is the imposing castle of mont orgueil , built around 1204 to protect the island from the french .
but for those now wanting to switch to french time , gallic cultural influences are welcome .
" the french mainland is just over my shoulder , " senator perchard said .

" a continental lifestyle is desirable - we 'd have the opportunity to spend longer out in the evenings .
it 's something that jersey could market and promote for tourists as well as enjoy for itself . "
financial risk not everyone is convinced though .
the biggest employer in jersey is the finance industry .
jersey sets its own taxes , and the competitive rates have attracted £ 220bn in deposits at 48 banks .
the majority of the industry are against it because it would get us in a situation where we 're not in line with our major trading partner , london geoff cook , jersey finance limited the organisation that represents the industry , jersey finance limited , has asked its members what they make of the proposed time zone change .
they are less than enthusiastic - with at least 70 % opposed to the idea .
the umbrella group 's headquarters have a corporate feel .
but for the panoramic coastal view , you could be in a boardroom in the city of london .
chief executive geoff cook acknowledges the benefits switching times could bring in terms of quality of life to islanders but says , on balance , most of his members are against the proposed change .
" we do n't believe it 's right - the majority of the industry are against it because it would disrupt business and get us in a situation where we 're not in line with our major trading partner , london , " he said .
" we would n't be able to start work till 1000 and you would have different lunch hours .
" in addition , in the current global climate we believe it 's just a risk we should n't be taking - a distraction we do n't need . "
cattle trouble for the island 's farmers , it is also the practicalities of a change that make many of them wary .
john le maistre , president of the jersey farmers union , has a herd of 90 jersey cows .

jersey farmer john le maistre puts the case to stay with the uk time zone and not move in line with europe .

" the cows are used to being milked so they will be making their way there , but there are always one or two stragglers , " he said .
" and you need to be able to see them .
in the dark , bluntly , you ca n't . "
meanwhile , in the uk , campaigners are watching the referendum with keen interest .
switching time zones has been on the political agenda for decades , but not far enough up it for those who would like to see a change .
crash statistics documents from the home office acknowledge that during the experiment with cet in the uk between 1968 and 1971 , there was a fall in the number of people killed in road accidents .

chief executive tom mullarkey said : " i think the people of jersey are in a tremendous position to show leadership here - if they make a positive decision in favour of daylight saving it 'll force the uk into a position where it 'll have to consider making this decision itself . "
such a change could mean the sun would not rise in parts of scotland until nearly 1000 in the winter , and , for the time being at least , the government is not convinced a change would be a positive move .
but the broader debate has been reinvigorated .
whatever the result of jersey 's referendum , just a few weeks before the clocks in the uk are turned back an hour , the question is being asked again .

researchers believe arachnids arriving in imports of food and plants are now able to survive and spread thanks to the uk 's increasingly mild climate .
the new inhabitants include a species of false widow spider and some believe the deadly black widow could be next to invade .
conservation group buglife wants import rules to be strengthened to stem the tide of alien species invasion .
matt shardlow , director of buglife , told bbc news : " other countries in the world take great care about what biological material they allow in , because it can contain pests that can damage our goods , our livelihoods , our health and our biodiversity .
our increasingly warm climate is starting to suit many more spiders stuart hine , natural history museum see other insects invading the uk " currently in the uk , we have a laissez-faire attitude - there is an open licence for people to bring in dangerous pests . "
but a spokesperson for the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- said that a new strategy was in place to " tackle the threat to the uk 's native biodiversity from unwanted pest species which have ' hitchhiked ' into the uk on plants " .
all this week , bbc news will be taking a closer look at some of the alien invaders that are in the uk .
aggressive arachnid john partridge from the british arachnological society said his organisation had had an increase in the number of enquiries about " strange spiders " .
he added : " we are certainly getting more spiders coming into the uk - and it seems that more are spreading around the country once they are in . "
false widow steatoda paykulliana is a new resident in the uk one new inhabitant is steatoda paykulliana , a false widow spider that is native to southern europe , west asia and north africa .
it is about 0.7-1.5cm -lrb- 0.3-0.6in -rrb- in size and can bite .
while this spider had been spotted in the uk in the past , it was thought that no colonies had established .
but stuart hine , who runs the insect identification service at the natural history museum , said this was no longer the case .
he said : " now we have found it in plymouth .
and it looks as if it is here to stay . "
the arrival of exotic spiders and insects that had hitched a ride on various imports was not a new phenomenon , said mr hine .
" if there was a warm period they would be able to survive , but a cold snap would kill them off , " he explained .
" but now , our increasingly warm climate is starting to suit many more spiders - and once they come in , they are able to stay put . "
this has also meant that some invasive species that once only existed within a few small pockets in the uk have been able to spread .

advertisement on the trail of the tube web exotic species of spiders are making their homes in the uk , scientists say .
researchers believe arachnids arriving in imports of food and plants are now able to survive and spread thanks to the uk 's increasingly mild climate .
the new inhabitants include a species of false widow spider and some believe the deadly black widow could be next to invade .
conservation group buglife wants import rules to be strengthened to stem the tide of alien species invasion .
matt shardlow , director of buglife , told bbc news : " other countries in the world take great care about what biological material they allow in , because it can contain pests that can damage our goods , our livelihoods , our health and our biodiversity .
our increasingly warm climate is starting to suit many more spiders stuart hine , natural history museum see other insects invading the uk " currently in the uk , we have a laissez-faire attitude - there is an open licence for people to bring in dangerous pests . "
but a spokesperson for the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- said that a new strategy was in place to " tackle the threat to the uk 's native biodiversity from unwanted pest species which have ' hitchhiked ' into the uk on plants " .
all this week , bbc news will be taking a closer look at some of the alien invaders that are in the uk .
aggressive arachnid john partridge from the british arachnological society said his organisation had had an increase in the number of enquiries about " strange spiders " .
he added : " we are certainly getting more spiders coming into the uk - and it seems that more are spreading around the country once they are in . "
false widow steatoda paykulliana is a new resident in the uk one new inhabitant is steatoda paykulliana , a false widow spider that is native to southern europe , west asia and north africa .
it is about 0.7-1.5cm -lrb- 0.3-0.6in -rrb- in size and can bite .
while this spider had been spotted in the uk in the past , it was thought that no colonies had established .
but stuart hine , who runs the insect identification service at the natural history museum , said this was no longer the case .
he said : " now we have found it in plymouth .
and it looks as if it is here to stay . "
the arrival of exotic spiders and insects that had hitched a ride on various imports was not a new phenomenon , said mr hine .
" if there was a warm period they would be able to survive , but a cold snap would kill them off , " he explained .
" but now , our increasingly warm climate is starting to suit many more spiders - and once they come in , they are able to stay put . "
this has also meant that some invasive species that once only existed within a few small pockets in the uk have been able to spread .
steatoda nobilis is one such spider .

it is a large spider , measuring between 1.5cm and 2.2cm -lrb- 0.6-0.9in -rrb- , with green iridescence on its jaws .

he said : " there is no great reason that they would n't survive here now - winters are now mild enough .
" it really is only a matter of time . "

the institution of civil engineers wales -lrb- ice -rrb- report said the transport network was deteriorating and more money would have to be found .
keith jones , the director of ice wales , said the current levels of transport investment were " inadequate to meet the needs of modern wales " .
the assembly government said this year 's transport budget was £ 570m .
but the report , the state of the nation : transport , said greater investment would give more travel options to people in wales , reducing journeys taken by car .
' real choice ' it said there was a strong link between wales ' transport network and economic growth and " significant ongoing funding " was needed to stop wales losing out to to other parts of the uk and the world .
mr jones said : " getting people out of their private cars in wales ' urban areas will only be achieved once government takes steps to provide integrated , accessible and reliable public transport services that offer communities real choice .
" we want to see a growth in the number of journeys to work made by bus , up to 10 % over the next few years from the current 4 % . "
the number of car journeys we make is growing , and growing faster in wales than in the rest of the uk " lee waters , sustainable transport cymru " for longer journeys , upgrades to wales ' north-south railway links will take passengers and freight off our limited number of highways .
more resources must be freed by government to keep wales moving . "
although the report welcomed improvements to north-south train services , the report said more money was needed to allow rail capacity to meet rising demand .
while east-west road links were described as good , it said north-south links remained poor .
a £ 30m investment over two years for road maintenance was praised , but the report said it was only a first step .
lee waters , co-ordinator for sustainable transport cymru , an alliance of public , private and voluntary organisations , said it wanted money shifted away from road schemes .
" it 's time to take a new direction .
transport is already responsible for a quarter of all our carbon emissions .
the number of car journeys we make is growing , and growing faster in wales than in the rest of the uk , " he said .
transport investment a spokesperson for the assembly government said it welcomed the recognition of its " substantial investment " to improve public transport across wales .
earlier this month it announced an extra £ 15m to be allocated for improving public transport in the 2009-10 draft budget .
" total transport investment in wales this year alone stands at over £ 570m , and includes £ 76m to deliver improvements across the trunk road network and more than £ 100m for local authorities to improve the local road network across wales .
" we are also committed to improving the road network and have committed over £ 90m to deliver a programme of improvements on trunk roads for 2009/10 and a further £ 100m to support local authorities in improving the local road network , " it said .

advertisement poor transport funding is damaging the welsh economy , says a report an underfunded transport network is threatening wales ' ability to sustain economic growth , a report says .
the institution of civil engineers wales -lrb- ice -rrb- report said the transport network was deteriorating and more money would have to be found .
keith jones , the director of ice wales , said the current levels of transport investment were " inadequate to meet the needs of modern wales " .
the assembly government said this year 's transport budget was £ 570m .
but the report , the state of the nation : transport , said greater investment would give more travel options to people in wales , reducing journeys taken by car .
' real choice ' it said there was a strong link between wales ' transport network and economic growth and " significant ongoing funding " was needed to stop wales losing out to to other parts of the uk and the world .
mr jones said : " getting people out of their private cars in wales ' urban areas will only be achieved once government takes steps to provide integrated , accessible and reliable public transport services that offer communities real choice .
" we want to see a growth in the number of journeys to work made by bus , up to 10 % over the next few years from the current 4 % .
the number of car journeys we make is growing , and growing faster in wales than in the rest of the uk lee waters , sustainable transport cymru " for longer journeys , upgrades to wales ' north-south railway links will take passengers and freight off our limited number of highways .
more resources must be freed by government to keep wales moving . "
although the report welcomed improvements to north-south train services , the report said more money was needed to allow rail capacity to meet rising demand .
while east-west road links were described as good , it said north-south links remained poor .
a £ 30m investment over two years for road maintenance was praised , but the report said it was only a first step .
lee waters , co-ordinator for sustainable transport cymru , an alliance of public , private and voluntary organisations , said it wanted money shifted away from road schemes .
" it 's time to take a new direction .
transport is already responsible for a quarter of all our carbon emissions .
the number of car journeys we make is growing , and growing faster in wales than in the rest of the uk , " he said .
transport investment a spokesperson for the assembly government said it welcomed the recognition of its " substantial investment " to improve public transport across wales .
earlier this month it announced an extra £ 15m to be allocated for improving public transport in the 2009-10 draft budget .
" total transport investment in wales this year alone stands at over £ 570m , and includes £ 76m to deliver improvements across the trunk road network and more than £ 100m for local authorities to improve the local road network across wales .
" we are also committed to improving the road network and have committed over £ 90m to deliver a programme of improvements on trunk roads for 2009/10 and a further £ 100m to support local authorities in improving the local road network , " it said .

advertisement ian jenkins has advanced kidney cancer and pays for some drugs privately the bbc has learned that payments to top up nhs care - supposedly banned - are happening at 30 hospitals across the uk .
professor mike richards , the cancer tsar for england , has been holding a review about so called co-payments and will report at the end of this month .
the issue is also under review in wales and scotland .
but patients are already topping up their nhs care , as hospitals find ways around the current rules .
ian jenkins , 47 , has kidney cancer which has spread to his lungs .
reading to his daughter eve has become a welcome escape .
the longer time i have with her the more chance and the more opportunity there is that she she is going to remember me as her dad ian jenkins cancer patient ian knows his prospects are not good , but he wants to do everything he can to prolong his life .
" i have a two-year-old daughter , " he said .
" she is growing up at the moment and her memories of me are developing .
" the longer time i have with her the more chance and the more opportunity there is that she she is going to remember me as her dad . "
ian is a patient at the queen elizabeth hospital in birmingham .
he wants to top up his care and buy a new cancer drug called sutent that is not available on the nhs .
the current rules say you can not mix and match between the nhs and private .
you are either all nhs and it is free or you 're all private and you pay for everything .
but the details are interesting .
the code of practice says a patient can not be both an nhs patient and private in the same episode of care .
way round problem so in birmingham they have found a way round the ban on top ups .
ian wants his daughter to remember him ian 's visit to hospital to see his nhs consultant is treated as one episode of care .
separately another consultant at the same hospital writes a private prescription for the drugs that ian wants to keep him alive .
they are supplied at ian 's home by a private company called healthcare at home .
ian pays the company direct .
so the administration of the drugs is viewed as a separate episode of care .
professor nick james is the oncologist in birmingham who designed this model of allowing patients to top up their care .
" nowhere does it say that an episode of care is from diagnosis to death of your cancer " he said .
" so we 've just interpreted the rules in a way which is in favour of the patients . "
across the country what is remarkable is that topping up , something the government says is banned , is not just happening in birmingham .
the company which provides the drugs to ian says they have contracts with 30 nhs hospitals across the country .
mike gordon , chief executive of healthcare at home , said : " top ups are happening today and they 'll happen tomorrow .
" so long as they 're done through us not using the auspices of the nhs i see no reason why they should n't continue . "
a department of health spokesperson said : " we know there is variation in how individual trusts are applying the current guidance , and that is why the secretary of state asked professor mike richards , national clinical director for cancer , to lead a review into this difficult issue .
" professor richards is looking at how a consistent approach across the country might be best achieved . "
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said : " david cameron and i have pressed the health secretary , alan johnson , to enter into a risk sharing scheme for the kidney cancer drug sutent in order that patients will be able to access this life saving treatment immediately , but nothing has been done . "
norman lamb , for the liberal democrats , said : " we are in an outrageous situation where patients are left in a lottery , dependent on a few hospitals which are bending the rules .
" this case makes the need for reform all the more urgent . "
all ian jenkins wants is to stay alive as long as possible .
but his story does raise the question , why the need for a high level review of top ups if they are already happening all over the country ?

shadow health secretary andrew lansley said : " david cameron and i have pressed the health secretary , alan johnson , to enter into a risk sharing scheme for the kidney cancer drug sutent in order that patients will be able to access this life saving treatment immediately , but nothing has been done .

norman lamb , for the liberal democrats , said : " we are in an outrageous situation where patients are left in a lottery , dependent on a few hospitals which are bending the rules .

advertisement ian jenkins has advanced kidney cancer and pays for some drugs privately the bbc has learned that payments to top up nhs care - supposedly banned - are happening at 30 hospitals across the uk .
professor mike richards , the cancer tsar for england , has been holding a review about so called co-payments and will report at the end of this month .
the issue is also under review in wales and scotland .
but patients are already topping up their nhs care , as hospitals find ways around the current rules .
ian jenkins , 47 , has kidney cancer which has spread to his lungs .
reading to his daughter eve has become a welcome escape .
the longer time i have with her the more chance and the more opportunity there is that she she is going to remember me as her dad ian jenkins cancer patient ian knows his prospects are not good , but he wants to do everything he can to prolong his life .
" i have a two-year-old daughter , " he said .
" she is growing up at the moment and her memories of me are developing .
" the longer time i have with her the more chance and the more opportunity there is that she she is going to remember me as her dad . "
ian is a patient at the queen elizabeth hospital in birmingham .
he wants to top up his care and buy a new cancer drug called sutent that is not available on the nhs .
the current rules say you can not mix and match between the nhs and private .
you are either all nhs and it is free or you 're all private and you pay for everything .
but the details are interesting .
the code of practice says a patient can not be both an nhs patient and private in the same episode of care .
way round problem so in birmingham they have found a way round the ban on top ups .
ian wants his daughter to remember him ian 's visit to hospital to see his nhs consultant is treated as one episode of care .
separately another consultant at the same hospital writes a private prescription for the drugs that ian wants to keep him alive .
they are supplied at ian 's home by a private company called healthcare at home .
ian pays the company direct .
so the administration of the drugs is viewed as a separate episode of care .
professor nick james is the oncologist in birmingham who designed this model of allowing patients to top up their care .
" nowhere does it say that an episode of care is from diagnosis to death of your cancer " he said .
" so we 've just interpreted the rules in a way which is in favour of the patients . "
across the country what is remarkable is that topping up , something the government says is banned , is not just happening in birmingham .
the company which provides the drugs to ian says they have contracts with 30 nhs hospitals across the country .
mike gordon , chief executive of healthcare at home , said : " top ups are happening today and they 'll happen tomorrow .
" so long as they 're done through us not using the auspices of the nhs i see no reason why they should n't continue . "
a department of health spokesperson said : " we know there is variation in how individual trusts are applying the current guidance , and that is why the secretary of state asked professor mike richards , national clinical director for cancer , to lead a review into this difficult issue .

the two reporters , from the well-known newspapers tuoi tre and thanh nien , are accused of " abusing freedom and democratic rights " .
they allegedly fabricated unspecified " sensitive information " while covering a high-profile corruption case .
it is not known how the accused pleaded when they appeared in court in hanoi .
two former high-ranking police officials have also been taken to court for allegedly leaking unauthorised information to the media .
' no commentary ' the so-called pmu-18 scandal , which broke in early 2006 , was named after a unit of the ministry of transport .
officials were found to have stolen development funds meant for roads and bridges , betting much of the money on european football .
they want to make sure that the press write about it as an ordinary trial and not one with any political implications hanoi reporter the scandal led to the arrest of a number of high-ranking officials and the departure of the then minister of transport dao dinh binh .
journalists nguyen van hai , 33 , and nguyen viet chien , 56 , were arrested last may and have been held since .
each wrote more than 50 news and feature stories on the case .
if found guilty , they could face up to seven years in jail .
the same jail sentence may apply to maj gen pham xuan quac and senior lt col dinh van huynh , the two policemen accused of deliberately disclosing investigative secrets .
ahead of one of the most talked-about trials in vietnam in recent years , the domestic press , paradoxically , stayed silent .
it is believed that the ideological department of the communist party , which maintains close control over the media , instructed reporters covering the two-day trial to report " only facts and no commentary " .
a reporter in hanoi , who wanted to remain anonymous , said : " they want to make sure that the press write about it as an ordinary trial and not one with any political implications . "
prolific coverage the case originally examined football betting allegations at pmu-18 , but gathered political steam after the arrest in april 2006 of vice minister nguyen viet tien .
mr tien was once in charge of pmu-18 and at the time of the arrest was considered a ministerial hopeful .
the case brought prolific media attention to his wrong-doings as well as his " immoral and decadent " lifestyle .
another rising star of the regime , maj gen cao ngoc oanh , lost his position as head of investigative police after newspapers named him as having personal contacts with someone implicated in the scandal .
but the case took an unexpected turn last spring when the authorities cleared the vice minister of corruption charges .
the spotlight then turned on the media reportage , soon deemed by the authorities to have been " erroneous " and " harmful " .
fear for coverage the subsequent arrest and prosecution of the two reporters has stirred up a storm , as tuoi tre and thanh nien are among the largest newspapers in the country .
foreign governments have expressed concern and rights organisations have repeatedly called for the release of mr hai and mr chien .
they express fear that their plight will deter newspapers from reporting on corruption cases in future .

the two reporters , from the well-known newspapers tuoi tre and thanh nien , are accused of " abusing freedom and democratic rights " .
they allegedly fabricated unspecified " sensitive information " while covering a high-profile corruption case .
it is not known how the accused pleaded when they appeared in court in hanoi .
two former high-ranking police officials have also been taken to court for allegedly leaking unauthorised information to the media .
' no commentary ' the so-called pmu-18 scandal , which broke in early 2006 , was named after a unit of the ministry of transport .
officials were found to have stolen development funds meant for roads and bridges , betting much of the money on european football .
they want to make sure that the press write about it as an ordinary trial and not one with any political implications hanoi reporter the scandal led to the arrest of a number of high-ranking officials and the departure of the then minister of transport dao dinh binh .
journalists nguyen van hai , 33 , and nguyen viet chien , 56 , were arrested last may and have been held since .
each wrote more than 50 news and feature stories on the case .
if found guilty , they could face up to seven years in jail .
the same jail sentence may apply to maj gen pham xuan quac and senior lt col dinh van huynh , the two policemen accused of deliberately disclosing investigative secrets .
ahead of one of the most talked-about trials in vietnam in recent years , the domestic press , paradoxically , stayed silent .
it is believed that the ideological department of the communist party , which maintains close control over the media , instructed reporters covering the two-day trial to report " only facts and no commentary " .
a reporter in hanoi , who wanted to remain anonymous , said : " they want to make sure that the press write about it as an ordinary trial and not one with any political implications . "
prolific coverage the case originally examined football betting allegations at pmu-18 , but gathered political steam after the arrest in april 2006 of vice minister nguyen viet tien .
mr tien was once in charge of pmu-18 and at the time of the arrest was considered a ministerial hopeful .
the case brought prolific media attention to his wrong-doings as well as his " immoral and decadent " lifestyle .
another rising star of the regime , maj gen cao ngoc oanh , lost his position as head of investigative police after newspapers named him as having personal contacts with someone implicated in the scandal .
but the case took an unexpected turn last spring when the authorities cleared the vice minister of corruption charges .
the spotlight then turned on the media reportage , soon deemed by the authorities to have been " erroneous " and " harmful " .
fear for coverage the subsequent arrest and prosecution of the two reporters has stirred up a storm , as tuoi tre and thanh nien are among the largest newspapers in the country .
foreign governments have expressed concern and rights organisations have repeatedly called for the release of mr hai and mr chien .
they express fear that their plight will deter newspapers from reporting on corruption cases in future .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- suga rush produces new album ' in weeks ' british broadcasting corporation home accessibility links mobile version skip to content skip to local navigation skip to bbc.co.uk navigation skip to bbc.co.uk search help accessibility help bbc news updated every minute of every day one-minute world news news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment arts & culture also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog bbc world service page last updated at 07:55 gmt , tuesday , 14 october 2008 08:55 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version suga rush produces new album ' in weeks ' by mark savage entertainment reporter , bbc news the sugababes were supposed to be taking a year off .
after scoring one of the biggest-selling singles of 2007 , about you now , and embarking on their largest tour to date , they were ready for some time alone .
for keisha buchanan , especially , it would have been a well-deserved break .
the 23-year-old has weathered two changes in line-up and one in record company since the pop trio scored their first hit , overload , eight years ago .
bandmate heidi range has just moved in with her long-term boyfriend , tv presenter dave berry , while amelle berrabah 's feet have barely touched the ground since she was drafted in to replace mutya buena in 2005 .
so why are they back so soon with a new single , girls , and a sixth album , catfights and spotlights ?
" we told a lot of our fans we were going away , so it 's kind of embarrassing , " admits buchanan .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
" we were going to take a year off , " she adds , " but we had this single and we thought we might as well keep the ball rolling . "
but making the album , and getting it ready for in time for the christmas sales peak , put the group under severe pressure .
" it was literally recorded in a couple of weeks , in between the festivals , and i had a lot of falling out with the record company , " she says .
" they were like ' you 've got to be in there , you 've got to write ' , but if you do n't feel creative on the day , you just ca n't do it . "
berrabah , 24 , admits the trio " hardly saw each other " during the recording process .
" there was n't enough time , " buchanan confirms .
" when i was in the studio , someone else would be trying to start a new idea somewhere else . "
' electro pop ban ' the group say the new record is something of a departure - with a " live band feel " and a " retro cool soul " sound .
so they are most displeased when i suggest that girls , an upbeat dance track based around a sample from ernie k doe 's here come the girls , is a perfect piece of hen-night handbag pop .
" i do n't see girls as being a pop track because the sample was a soul song , " scolds buchanan .
" it only comes across like that because it 's a girl band singing it . "
" we did n't want to go down the pop route on this album , " she adds , " and that 's the reason we banned electro pop . "
i think every single awards show should be voted for by the public - not five blokes who make a decision on who they think should win .
it 's just ridiculous amelle berrabah " it 's like ' spot the pop song ' , " confirms berrabah .
if they seem wary of their pop background , it 's somewhat understandable .
despite their enviable run of chart success , they have only ever won one brit award - in the now-abandoned best dance category .
" i do n't really like the brits , " says berrabah .
" it 's all politics . "
" i think every single awards show should be voted for by the public - not five blokes who make a decision on who they think should win .
it 's just ridiculous . "
" it 's annoying and it 's discouraging , " adds buchanan .
" it makes you feel like you 're doing all this for nothing . "
' bigger than girls aloud ' one thing the trio can , and do , take pride in , however , is their sales record .
the artwork for the new single boasts that the sugababes are the " best-selling girl band of the 21st century " .
their closest rivals are girls aloud - who have largely failed to make an impact abroad , a point which buchanan is keen to drive home .
" let 's just set the record straight .
we sell a lot more records than girls aloud , " she says .
" i get asked a lot , ' are n't they a bigger band than you ? '
" well , no .
they 're not . "
she stresses there is no bad blood between the groups - but the comparative lack of recognition is clearly a thorn in her side .
the sugababes say they are very different to chart rivals girls aloud " all of their records have gone top 10 , which is something we do n't have , " she observes , " but we have longevity , we write our own stuff and we 've sold more records . "
" we just want to be known for our music , " confirms berrabah , diplomatically .
" when we got a review that said we put on a good performance at the isle of wight festival , it put a smile on my face for a month .
buchanan jumps in again : " and that 's better for us than to be in the latest magazine . "
rougher ride nonetheless , the sugababes have dipped their toes into the murky waters of celebrity in recent months .
buchanan has signed a deal to model glasses for a german firm , while range appeared on celebrity mr & mrs over the summer .
berrabah has had a rougher ride in the tabloids , who made a big deal of her two arrests -lrb- the first time she was acquitted , on the second it turned out she had not been in town at the time of the alleged incident -rrb- .
there have also been a series of revelations about her boyfriend freddie fuller , who was falsely accused of rape by berrabah 's sister in early 2007 and then fell victim to a near-fatal machete attack at the end of last year .
in 2005 mutya buena -lrb- centre -rrb- left and was replaced by amelle berrabah she refuses to be drawn on any of these subjects , but admits it all fed into her writing on catfights and spotlights .
" i 've had it in my head , to be honest , " she says .
" there 's a song on the album called beware and i had someone on my mind while writing that . "
berrabah finds writing to be a healthy outlet for her emotions , and professes to be " excited " by the creative process .
the group are already planning their seventh album , to be recorded at a more leisurely pace next year .
" we 'd like to work with gnarls barkley , andre 3000 -lsb- from outkast -rsb- , and we already had plans to work with timbaland on the new record , " says buchanan .
berrabah adds : " this record was done in such a short period of time that when we wanted to work with someone , it depended on their schedule being empty at the right time .
" if we do the next album slowly , it 'll be quite nice to actually have time to do that . "
girls is out now on island records .
catfights and spotlights is released on 20 october .

after scoring one of the biggest-selling singles of 2007 , about you now , and embarking on their largest tour to date , they were ready for some time alone .
for keisha buchanan , especially , it would have been a well-deserved break .
the 23-year-old has weathered two changes in line-up and one in record company since the pop trio scored their first hit , overload , eight years ago .
bandmate heidi range has just moved in with her long-term boyfriend , tv presenter dave berry , while amelle berrabah 's feet have barely touched the ground since she was drafted in to replace mutya buena in 2005 .
so why are they back so soon with a new single , girls , and a sixth album , catfights and spotlights ?
" we told a lot of our fans we were going away , so it 's kind of embarrassing , " admits buchanan .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
" we were going to take a year off , " she adds , " but we had this single and we thought we might as well keep the ball rolling . "
but making the album , and getting it ready for in time for the christmas sales peak , put the group under severe pressure .
" it was literally recorded in a couple of weeks , in between the festivals , and i had a lot of falling out with the record company , " she says .
" they were like ' you 've got to be in there , you 've got to write ' , but if you do n't feel creative on the day , you just ca n't do it . "
berrabah , 24 , admits the trio " hardly saw each other " during the recording process .
" there was n't enough time , " buchanan confirms .
" when i was in the studio , someone else would be trying to start a new idea somewhere else . "
' electro pop ban ' the group say the new record is something of a departure - with a " live band feel " and a " retro cool soul " sound .
so they are most displeased when i suggest that girls , an upbeat dance track based around a sample from ernie k doe 's here come the girls , is a perfect piece of hen-night handbag pop .
" i do n't see girls as being a pop track because the sample was a soul song , " scolds buchanan .
" it only comes across like that because it 's a girl band singing it . "
" we did n't want to go down the pop route on this album , " she adds , " and that 's the reason we banned electro pop . "
i think every single awards show should be voted for by the public - not five blokes who make a decision on who they think should win .
it 's just ridiculous amelle berrabah " it 's like ' spot the pop song ' , " confirms berrabah .
if they seem wary of their pop background , it 's somewhat understandable .
despite their enviable run of chart success , they have only ever won one brit award - in the now-abandoned best dance category .
" i do n't really like the brits , " says berrabah .
" it 's all politics . "
" i think every single awards show should be voted for by the public - not five blokes who make a decision on who they think should win .
it 's just ridiculous . "
" it 's annoying and it 's discouraging , " adds buchanan .
" it makes you feel like you 're doing all this for nothing . "
' bigger than girls aloud ' one thing the trio can , and do , take pride in , however , is their sales record .
the artwork for the new single boasts that the sugababes are the " best-selling girl band of the 21st century " .
their closest rivals are girls aloud - who have largely failed to make an impact abroad , a point which buchanan is keen to drive home .
" let 's just set the record straight .
we sell a lot more records than girls aloud , " she says .
" i get asked a lot , ' are n't they a bigger band than you ? '
" well , no .
they 're not . "
she stresses there is no bad blood between the groups - but the comparative lack of recognition is clearly a thorn in her side .
the sugababes say they are very different to chart rivals girls aloud " all of their records have gone top 10 , which is something we do n't have , " she observes , " but we have longevity , we write our own stuff and we 've sold more records . "
" we just want to be known for our music , " confirms berrabah , diplomatically .
" when we got a review that said we put on a good performance at the isle of wight festival , it put a smile on my face for a month .
buchanan jumps in again : " and that 's better for us than to be in the latest magazine . "
rougher ride nonetheless , the sugababes have dipped their toes into the murky waters of celebrity in recent months .
buchanan has signed a deal to model glasses for a german firm , while range appeared on celebrity mr & mrs over the summer .
berrabah has had a rougher ride in the tabloids , who made a big deal of her two arrests -lrb- the first time she was acquitted , on the second it turned out she had not been in town at the time of the alleged incident -rrb- .
there have also been a series of revelations about her boyfriend freddie fuller , who was falsely accused of rape by berrabah 's sister in early 2007 and then fell victim to a near-fatal machete attack at the end of last year .
in 2005 mutya buena -lrb- centre -rrb- left and was replaced by amelle berrabah she refuses to be drawn on any of these subjects , but admits it all fed into her writing on catfights and spotlights .
" i 've had it in my head , to be honest , " she says .
" there 's a song on the album called beware and i had someone on my mind while writing that . "
berrabah finds writing to be a healthy outlet for her emotions , and professes to be " excited " by the creative process .
the group are already planning their seventh album , to be recorded at a more leisurely pace next year .
" we 'd like to work with gnarls barkley , andre 3000 -lsb- from outkast -rsb- , and we already had plans to work with timbaland on the new record , " says buchanan .
berrabah adds : " this record was done in such a short period of time that when we wanted to work with someone , it depended on their schedule being empty at the right time .
" if we do the next album slowly , it 'll be quite nice to actually have time to do that . "
girls is out now on island records .
catfights and spotlights is released on 20 october .

ms hogan said it was unquestionable that hiv caused aids and conventional medicines were the best treatment .
this comes in sharp contrast to her predecessor , manto tshabalala-msimang , who spent years resisting the introduction of anti-retroviral drugs .
some 5.5 million south africans have hiv - more than in any other country .
dr tshabalala-msimang earned the nickname " dr beetroot " for advocating healthy eating , as an alternative to arv drugs . "
we desperately need an effective hiv vaccine " health minister barbara hogan new era for aids fight ?
without directly criticising her predecessor , ms hogan told an international aids vaccine conference in cape town on monday that time had been wasted in the country 's battle against aids .
it was , she added , imperative that hiv prevention programmes were successful .
ms hogan 's appointment as health minister has been welcomed by anti-aids campaigners .
' breath of fresh air ' " we know that hiv causes aids , " ms hogan said .
" it was imperative to get ahead of the curve of this epidemic 10 years ago .
we all have lost ground .
it 's even more imperative now that we make hiv prevention work .
we desperately need an effective hiv vaccine . "
commenting on her speech , alan bernstein , executive director of the global hiv vaccine enterprise , said she was " a breath of fresh air " .
malegapuru makgoba , vice-chancellor and principal of the university of kwazulu-natal , said that for the first time in years , south african academics were free to " state that hiv causes aids without getting threats " .
" it is a liberating experience , " he said at the conference .

the rule means dancers at the red square -lrb- divas -rrb- club in newquay must stay 3ft -lrb- 0.91m -rrb- away from customers .
it brings the club in line with four other lap-dancing establishments in the resort .
red square said it would appeal against the ban which restormel borough councillors voted in favour of at a meeting on monday .
the ban will not come in to force until the appeal has been heard .
the girls do choose to work in these clubs but they need protection tracy earnshaw , campaigner three lap dancers from the club sat through the four-hour council meeting when the ban was debated on monday evening .
andrew waters , the chair of restormel 's licensing committee , said it was important to bring red square in line with newquay 's other lap dancing clubs .
but nicholas hall , the solicitor representing red square , said : " no alcohol is served within the dancing area .
" every seat can be seen by a full-time security presence and activities are monitored by cctv cameras .
" the management engage their dancers in a formal contract which includes a ' code of contact ' which each dancer is invited to execute as part of her employment . "
tracy earnshaw , who campaigned for the contact ban , said : " i would like to think that the club would see that it 's perfectly reasonable to have a condition whereby the girls should n't be touched .
" the girls do choose to work in these clubs but they need protection , and that condition offers that . "
