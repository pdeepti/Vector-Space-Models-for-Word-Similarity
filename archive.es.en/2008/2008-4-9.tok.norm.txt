program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 09.04.2008 germany feels pressure to aid more christian iraqis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq once had 1.4 million christians , but numbers have shrunk dramatically germany is debating whether to give visas to more iraqi christian refugees , given their widespread mistreatment at home .
but some argue that singling out one minority is unfair . five years after iraqi dictator saddam hussein was ousted , the sunni and shiite muslim communities seem to be united on at least one front - their hatred of christians . germany 's catholic and protestant churches are alarmed about rising sectarian violence being committed against christians in iraq .
bombed churches , beheaded clergymen , and massacres of women and children : according to observers , the very existence of this religious minority , which has been settled in iraq for nearly 2,000 years , is threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving alms is a christian value , in iraq as elsewhere as a result , german churches are calling on the government to open the borders for persecuted christians from iraq . worsening situation for christians " the churches ask for a relevant number of christians and other non-muslim religious groups , " said nele allenberg , a legal expert from germany 's protestant church . " there are around 180,000 christian refugees in iraq 's neighboring countries - that is syria , jordan and also turkey .
germany would have to take in a big part of these people , meaning 20,000 to 30,000 people , " allenberg said . she said the situation for iraqi christians today is significantly worse than before saddam hussein was ousted from power five years ago , when the country 's christians lived peacefully side by side with sunni and shiite muslims . now christians tend to be associated with american and british invaders , who many muslims believed would be waging a modern-day crusade against islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria has been flooded with iraqi christian refugees the chairman of the council of the protestant church in germany , bishop wolfgang huber , made a similar point in his good friday prayers .
he named the atrocities that have been visited upon iraqi christians and noted : " the constitution allows all religious groups , so on paper the situation should be better .
but actually the situation is worse . " greens : ' we have to help everybody ' negotiations are underway within the german government and parliament , to sort out numbers and procedures for such a resettlement program , and there is political consensus that swift action is urgently needed . but some warn that christians are not the only ones suffering , and say they should not be singled out in a time of humanitarian crisis . germany 's green party endorses the plan , but says opening the gates only for christians is hypocritical .
volker beck , a senior green party lawmaker , criticized germany 's ruling coalition for being willing to take in christians from iraq , but not other refugees . " we have to help everybody who is persecuted and can not say these are our christian brothers and sisters , and for others with a different identity we do n't care , " beck said . the churches say they share this view , but that first they have to push for what can be achieved politically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches in iraq have suffered bombing attacks meanwhile , iraqi christians warn that time is running out , as refugees in countries bordering on iraq are under mounting pressure to return home to a hostile environment . those iraqi christians who have made it to germany - often after great travails - are hoping the state of legal limbo they are currently in will soon come to an end . refugees face long road , live in fear aida , a 39-year-old refugee who did not want to disclose her full name , said she is still fearful even though she has been out of iraq for two years . she arrived in germany after a long trip via turkey and greece . she 's afraid that more of her relatives will share the brutal fate of one of her cousins , who was killed by a mob of muslim youngsters in the streets of baghdad . " they killed him and left him in the street , " aida said .
" after that i decided to leave my country and come here , because my father and my mother , and my sisters are here . " under eu rules , however , they are illegal aliens and would have to leave germany . uwe hessler -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 09.04.2008 oecd study urges germany to pursue reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy is expected to grow despite fears of a global recession the organization for economic cooperation and development says the german economic upswing is set to continue but warned berlin it had to undertake reforms in every sector , in particular education , to maintain its edge . germany had enjoyed a strong cyclical rebound after a long period of stagnation , the oecd said , adding that solid foundations had been laid for sustaining the upswing or at least mitigating the effects of financial market turmoil .
it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .
rising energy prices are another hot german issue at present .
incumbent companies currently have " considerable scope to make market entry for their competitors cumbersome and costly , " the oecd noted . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 09.04.2008 germany feels pressure to aid more christian iraqis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq once had 1.4 million christians , but numbers have shrunk dramatically germany is debating whether to give visas to more iraqi christian refugees , given their widespread mistreatment at home .
but some argue that singling out one minority is unfair . five years after iraqi dictator saddam hussein was ousted , the sunni and shiite muslim communities seem to be united on at least one front - their hatred of christians . germany 's catholic and protestant churches are alarmed about rising sectarian violence being committed against christians in iraq .
bombed churches , beheaded clergymen , and massacres of women and children : according to observers , the very existence of this religious minority , which has been settled in iraq for nearly 2,000 years , is threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving alms is a christian value , in iraq as elsewhere as a result , german churches are calling on the government to open the borders for persecuted christians from iraq . worsening situation for christians " the churches ask for a relevant number of christians and other non-muslim religious groups , " said nele allenberg , a legal expert from germany 's protestant church . " there are around 180,000 christian refugees in iraq 's neighboring countries - that is syria , jordan and also turkey .
germany would have to take in a big part of these people , meaning 20,000 to 30,000 people , " allenberg said . she said the situation for iraqi christians today is significantly worse than before saddam hussein was ousted from power five years ago , when the country 's christians lived peacefully side by side with sunni and shiite muslims . now christians tend to be associated with american and british invaders , who many muslims believed would be waging a modern-day crusade against islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria has been flooded with iraqi christian refugees the chairman of the council of the protestant church in germany , bishop wolfgang huber , made a similar point in his good friday prayers .
he named the atrocities that have been visited upon iraqi christians and noted : " the constitution allows all religious groups , so on paper the situation should be better .
but actually the situation is worse . " greens : ' we have to help everybody ' negotiations are underway within the german government and parliament , to sort out numbers and procedures for such a resettlement program , and there is political consensus that swift action is urgently needed . but some warn that christians are not the only ones suffering , and say they should not be singled out in a time of humanitarian crisis . germany 's green party endorses the plan , but says opening the gates only for christians is hypocritical .
volker beck , a senior green party lawmaker , criticized germany 's ruling coalition for being willing to take in christians from iraq , but not other refugees . " we have to help everybody who is persecuted and can not say these are our christian brothers and sisters , and for others with a different identity we do n't care , " beck said . the churches say they share this view , but that first they have to push for what can be achieved politically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches in iraq have suffered bombing attacks meanwhile , iraqi christians warn that time is running out , as refugees in countries bordering on iraq are under mounting pressure to return home to a hostile environment . those iraqi christians who have made it to germany - often after great travails - are hoping the state of legal limbo they are currently in will soon come to an end . refugees face long road , live in fear aida , a 39-year-old refugee who did not want to disclose her full name , said she is still fearful even though she has been out of iraq for two years . she arrived in germany after a long trip via turkey and greece . she 's afraid that more of her relatives will share the brutal fate of one of her cousins , who was killed by a mob of muslim youngsters in the streets of baghdad . " they killed him and left him in the street , " aida said .
" after that i decided to leave my country and come here , because my father and my mother , and my sisters are here .

airbus ceo tom enders rejected the allegations on wed , april 9 . enders stated that he and other officials were innocent of insider trading and called a report by french web news service mediapart which detailed the allegations incompetent , biased and unfair .
news of the probe into possible insider trading was leaked to the internet site which then published the allegations on tuesday , an act that enders called " shocking " and " unacceptable . "
" i know i have done nothing wrong nd i say the same for all the managers who are supposedly involved , " the airbus ceo told a news briefing in new zealand .
" i am absolutely convinced there was no wrong-doing .
we will demonstrate that the people who have done the investigation have n't done that in a competent way , " he said .
" we will defend our reputation and our rights to be presumed innocent with all means at our disposal , " he said .
" our names are dragged into the mud ... and we are sitting ducks .
so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .
airbus ceo calls french probe " biased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders believes the probe is driven by a conspiracy theory enders not only heavily criticized the online article but also the amf investigation itself , calling it " unfair " and " biased . "
" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "
the amf had previously announced that there was cause for action against several people at eads over alleged insider trading at the end of 2005 and in early 2006 , but did not release any names .
probe claims shares sold before delay made public the double-decker a380 is the largest passenger airline ever built , and has been the centerpiece of airbus efforts to compete with us rival boeing .
it made its first commercial flight in october after billions of dollars in cost over-runs and months of delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 delays were known three months before going public in march 2006 , eads privately cut its 2007 delivery target for the new superjumbo aircraft .
later that month , lagardere and what was then daimlerchrysler said they would each sell a 7.5 percent stake in eads .
the a380 delays were publicly announced in june 2006 , sending the eads share price down more than 26 percent .
the amf said shortly after that it was looking at certain previous stock deals , and in july 2006 , forgeard stepped down .
he has denied any wrongdoing .
the french government , which has a 15 percent stake in eads , has insisted its conduct in the matter has been " beyond reproach . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus ceo tom enders rejected the allegations on wed , april 9 . enders stated that he and other officials were innocent of insider trading and called a report by french web news service mediapart which detailed the allegations incompetent , biased and unfair .
news of the probe into possible insider trading was leaked to the internet site which then published the allegations on tuesday , an act that enders called " shocking " and " unacceptable . "
" i know i have done nothing wrong nd i say the same for all the managers who are supposedly involved , " the airbus ceo told a news briefing in new zealand .
" i am absolutely convinced there was no wrong-doing .
we will demonstrate that the people who have done the investigation have n't done that in a competent way , " he said .
" we will defend our reputation and our rights to be presumed innocent with all means at our disposal , " he said .
" our names are dragged into the mud ... and we are sitting ducks .
so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .
airbus ceo calls french probe " biased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders believes the probe is driven by a conspiracy theory enders not only heavily criticized the online article but also the amf investigation itself , calling it " unfair " and " biased . "
" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "
the amf had previously announced that there was cause for action against several people at eads over alleged insider trading at the end of 2005 and in early 2006 , but did not release any names .

but with its focus on human rights , the eu is likely to have a tougher time wooing the region 's nations than russia and china . the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on wednesday , april 9 , in the turkmen capital ashgabat is well overdue .
china , russia and other former soviet states already staked their claim there long ago . china has negotiated a gas pipeline project with turkmenistan that , starting in 2009 , is to deliver 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually to the people 's republic .
india and iran have also discovered the " stans " in central asia as both suppliers of energy and a profitable new market . over a year ago , the eu joined in the race for energy reserves and market potential in central asia .
in june 2007 , the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia in an effort to strengthen ties with turkmenistan , uzbekistan and the neighboring countries . more than just political good intentions are at stake : turkmenistan is one of the world 's most important gas suppliers and kazakhstan has one of the 10 largest oil and gas reserves . bildunterschrift : the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia last summer eu ca n't afford to compromise on rights issues the focus of wednesday 's meeting between the eu ministers and their central asian counterparts , led by slovenian head diplomat dimitrij rupel , is to determine what shape a partnership should take . one thing is already clear : the negotiations wo n't be easy .
while countries like russia and china are exclusively concerned with business matters , the europeans want to help improve the human rights situation in the region , said cem oezdemir , the european parliament 's rapporteur on central asia . " we have to make it clear that we ca n't allow ourselves to become dependent at any price and throw our standards overboard , " said oezdemir , a european parliamentarian for the green party . if the eu were to avoid taking a clear stance against human rights abuses in countries like uzbekistan and kazakhstan , it would jeopardize its own credibility , he added , since restricting press freedom , getting rid of the opposition and holding bogus elections run contrary to what europe stands for .

but some argue that singling out one minority is unfair . five years after iraqi dictator saddam hussein was ousted , the sunni and shiite muslim communities seem to be united on at least one front - their hatred of christians . germany 's catholic and protestant churches are alarmed about rising sectarian violence being committed against christians in iraq .
bombed churches , beheaded clergymen , and massacres of women and children : according to observers , the very existence of this religious minority , which has been settled in iraq for nearly 2,000 years , is threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving alms is a christian value , in iraq as elsewhere as a result , german churches are calling on the government to open the borders for persecuted christians from iraq . worsening situation for christians " the churches ask for a relevant number of christians and other non-muslim religious groups , " said nele allenberg , a legal expert from germany 's protestant church . " there are around 180,000 christian refugees in iraq 's neighboring countries - that is syria , jordan and also turkey .
germany would have to take in a big part of these people , meaning 20,000 to 30,000 people , " allenberg said . she said the situation for iraqi christians today is significantly worse than before saddam hussein was ousted from power five years ago , when the country 's christians lived peacefully side by side with sunni and shiite muslims . now christians tend to be associated with american and british invaders , who many muslims believed would be waging a modern-day crusade against islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria has been flooded with iraqi christian refugees the chairman of the council of the protestant church in germany , bishop wolfgang huber , made a similar point in his good friday prayers .
he named the atrocities that have been visited upon iraqi christians and noted : " the constitution allows all religious groups , so on paper the situation should be better .
but actually the situation is worse . " greens : ' we have to help everybody ' negotiations are underway within the german government and parliament , to sort out numbers and procedures for such a resettlement program , and there is political consensus that swift action is urgently needed . but some warn that christians are not the only ones suffering , and say they should not be singled out in a time of humanitarian crisis . germany 's green party endorses the plan , but says opening the gates only for christians is hypocritical .
volker beck , a senior green party lawmaker , criticized germany 's ruling coalition for being willing to take in christians from iraq , but not other refugees . " we have to help everybody who is persecuted and can not say these are our christian brothers and sisters , and for others with a different identity we do n't care , " beck said . the churches say they share this view , but that first they have to push for what can be achieved politically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches in iraq have suffered bombing attacks meanwhile , iraqi christians warn that time is running out , as refugees in countries bordering on iraq are under mounting pressure to return home to a hostile environment . those iraqi christians who have made it to germany - often after great travails - are hoping the state of legal limbo they are currently in will soon come to an end . refugees face long road , live in fear aida , a 39-year-old refugee who did not want to disclose her full name , said she is still fearful even though she has been out of iraq for two years . she arrived in germany after a long trip via turkey and greece . she 's afraid that more of her relatives will share the brutal fate of one of her cousins , who was killed by a mob of muslim youngsters in the streets of baghdad . " they killed him and left him in the street , " aida said .
" after that i decided to leave my country and come here , because my father and my mother , and my sisters are here .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 09.04.2008 oecd study urges germany to pursue reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy is expected to grow despite fears of a global recession the organization for economic cooperation and development says the german economic upswing is set to continue but warned berlin it had to undertake reforms in every sector , in particular education , to maintain its edge . germany had enjoyed a strong cyclical rebound after a long period of stagnation , the oecd said , adding that solid foundations had been laid for sustaining the upswing or at least mitigating the effects of financial market turmoil .
it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .
rising energy prices are another hot german issue at present .
incumbent companies currently have " considerable scope to make market entry for their competitors cumbersome and costly , " the oecd noted . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bottom-up initiative aims to bring a more international perspective to the party 's work and combat anti-americanism among some members back home . the chapter is due to be officially founded next weekend in washington dc .
it hopes to tap into the experiences of the growing number of germans working in the us capital in international organizations , foundations and think tanks , as well as in the media , the culture industry and higher education . " we 've discovered that there are a lot of germans in town who are young , tolerant and cosmopolitan and who share green values or are active in the green party , " said chapter co-founder arne jungjohann .

bombed churches , beheaded clergymen , and massacres of women and children : according to observers , the very existence of this religious minority , which has been settled in iraq for nearly 2,000 years , is threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving alms is a christian value , in iraq as elsewhere as a result , german churches are calling on the government to open the borders for persecuted christians from iraq . worsening situation for christians " the churches ask for a relevant number of christians and other non-muslim religious groups , " said nele allenberg , a legal expert from germany 's protestant church . " there are around 180,000 christian refugees in iraq 's neighboring countries - that is syria , jordan and also turkey .

but with its focus on human rights , the eu is likely to have a tougher time wooing the region 's nations than russia and china . the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on wednesday , april 9 , in the turkmen capital ashgabat is well overdue .
china , russia and other former soviet states already staked their claim there long ago . china has negotiated a gas pipeline project with turkmenistan that , starting in 2009 , is to deliver 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually to the people 's republic .
india and iran have also discovered the " stans " in central asia as both suppliers of energy and a profitable new market . over a year ago , the eu joined in the race for energy reserves and market potential in central asia .
in june 2007 , the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia in an effort to strengthen ties with turkmenistan , uzbekistan and the neighboring countries . more than just political good intentions are at stake : turkmenistan is one of the world 's most important gas suppliers and kazakhstan has one of the 10 largest oil and gas reserves . bildunterschrift : the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia last summer eu ca n't afford to compromise on rights issues the focus of wednesday 's meeting between the eu ministers and their central asian counterparts , led by slovenian head diplomat dimitrij rupel , is to determine what shape a partnership should take . one thing is already clear : the negotiations wo n't be easy .
while countries like russia and china are exclusively concerned with business matters , the europeans want to help improve the human rights situation in the region , said cem oezdemir , the european parliament 's rapporteur on central asia . " we have to make it clear that we ca n't allow ourselves to become dependent at any price and throw our standards overboard , " said oezdemir , a european parliamentarian for the green party . if the eu were to avoid taking a clear stance against human rights abuses in countries like uzbekistan and kazakhstan , it would jeopardize its own credibility , he added , since restricting press freedom , getting rid of the opposition and holding bogus elections run contrary to what europe stands for . " we have to have the courage to address -lsb- human rights violations -rsb- , even if the other competitors are n't interested in that . " appeals for improvement are n't likely to go over well with the new strategic partners in central asia . trade and values do n't go hand in hand as part of the soviet union , the region was subject to moscow 's rule for decades , and political advice can easily be taken as indoctrination , said andrea schmitz from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would lose its credibility if it did n't stand up for rights " a transfer of values would mean that the values would have to materialize in the form of institutions that represent them , but the elites in these countries simply seem to be lacking the political will , " said schmitz . despite the problems , there is interest among central asian nations to cooperate more closely with europe and seek new trade partners and european investors , in part to minimize their reliance on china and russia , schmitz said . " because of russia 's and china 's dominance and the resources they use to exercise power in central asia , the countries want to establish counterweights . " some central asian countries have already succeeded in doing just that . kazakhstan for instance has already attracted numerous german mid-sized companies . " growth rates are enormous , " said gerd herx , director of the german office for foreign trade .
" we have deliveries to kazakhstan with a trade volume of about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- . "
herx said he sees strong chances for european enterprisers in uzbekistan as well . while trade improves between the eu and central asia , many european entrepreneurs are hesitant about investing directly in the region , schmitz said , because of huge legal uncertainties . no direct pipelines to europe it 's likely to be even more difficult for the eu to push through its interests regarding energy policy .
europe wants to become more independent of russian gas and has had its eye on turkmenistan 's plentiful gas resources for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a transit country for gas deliveries to europe the problem is that until now turkmenistan 's gas exports have to flow through russia to reach europe - there are simply no other gas pipelines . europe wants to support the construction of new pipelines that circumvent russia , but schmitz questioned the viability the proposal . " it remains to be seen whether turkmenistan will ever be able to transport gas directly to europe , " she said . what 's more , turkmenistan is still focusing more strongly on russia than on the eu , said oezdemir , who expressed doubts that europe could do much to change that . " as long as the eu does n't have a common energy policy itself , we wo n't have a chance to compete with russia as far as central asia and the energy corridor go , " he said . manfred goetzke -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with its focus on human rights , the eu is likely to have a tougher time wooing the region 's nations than russia and china . the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on wednesday , april 9 , in the turkmen capital ashgabat is well overdue .
china , russia and other former soviet states already staked their claim there long ago . china has negotiated a gas pipeline project with turkmenistan that , starting in 2009 , is to deliver 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually to the people 's republic .
india and iran have also discovered the " stans " in central asia as both suppliers of energy and a profitable new market . over a year ago , the eu joined in the race for energy reserves and market potential in central asia .
in june 2007 , the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia in an effort to strengthen ties with turkmenistan , uzbekistan and the neighboring countries . more than just political good intentions are at stake : turkmenistan is one of the world 's most important gas suppliers and kazakhstan has one of the 10 largest oil and gas reserves . bildunterschrift : the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia last summer eu ca n't afford to compromise on rights issues the focus of wednesday 's meeting between the eu ministers and their central asian counterparts , led by slovenian head diplomat dimitrij rupel , is to determine what shape a partnership should take . one thing is already clear : the negotiations wo n't be easy .
while countries like russia and china are exclusively concerned with business matters , the europeans want to help improve the human rights situation in the region , said cem oezdemir , the european parliament 's rapporteur on central asia . " we have to make it clear that we ca n't allow ourselves to become dependent at any price and throw our standards overboard , " said oezdemir , a european parliamentarian for the green party . if the eu were to avoid taking a clear stance against human rights abuses in countries like uzbekistan and kazakhstan , it would jeopardize its own credibility , he added , since restricting press freedom , getting rid of the opposition and holding bogus elections run contrary to what europe stands for . " we have to have the courage to address -lsb- human rights violations -rsb- , even if the other competitors are n't interested in that . " appeals for improvement are n't likely to go over well with the new strategic partners in central asia . trade and values do n't go hand in hand as part of the soviet union , the region was subject to moscow 's rule for decades , and political advice can easily be taken as indoctrination , said andrea schmitz from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would lose its credibility if it did n't stand up for rights " a transfer of values would mean that the values would have to materialize in the form of institutions that represent them , but the elites in these countries simply seem to be lacking the political will , " said schmitz . despite the problems , there is interest among central asian nations to cooperate more closely with europe and seek new trade partners and european investors , in part to minimize their reliance on china and russia , schmitz said . " because of russia 's and china 's dominance and the resources they use to exercise power in central asia , the countries want to establish counterweights . " some central asian countries have already succeeded in doing just that . kazakhstan for instance has already attracted numerous german mid-sized companies .

" we have to make it clear that we ca n't allow ourselves to become dependent at any price and throw our standards overboard , " said oezdemir , a european parliamentarian for the green party . if the eu were to avoid taking a clear stance against human rights abuses in countries like uzbekistan and kazakhstan , it would jeopardize its own credibility , he added , since restricting press freedom , getting rid of the opposition and holding bogus elections run contrary to what europe stands for . " we have to have the courage to address -lsb- human rights violations -rsb- , even if the other competitors are n't interested in that . " appeals for improvement are n't likely to go over well with the new strategic partners in central asia . trade and values do n't go hand in hand as part of the soviet union , the region was subject to moscow 's rule for decades , and political advice can easily be taken as indoctrination , said andrea schmitz from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would lose its credibility if it did n't stand up for rights " a transfer of values would mean that the values would have to materialize in the form of institutions that represent them , but the elites in these countries simply seem to be lacking the political will , " said schmitz . despite the problems , there is interest among central asian nations to cooperate more closely with europe and seek new trade partners and european investors , in part to minimize their reliance on china and russia , schmitz said . " because of russia 's and china 's dominance and the resources they use to exercise power in central asia , the countries want to establish counterweights . " some central asian countries have already succeeded in doing just that . kazakhstan for instance has already attracted numerous german mid-sized companies . " growth rates are enormous , " said gerd herx , director of the german office for foreign trade .
" we have deliveries to kazakhstan with a trade volume of about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- . "
herx said he sees strong chances for european enterprisers in uzbekistan as well . while trade improves between the eu and central asia , many european entrepreneurs are hesitant about investing directly in the region , schmitz said , because of huge legal uncertainties . no direct pipelines to europe it 's likely to be even more difficult for the eu to push through its interests regarding energy policy .
europe wants to become more independent of russian gas and has had its eye on turkmenistan 's plentiful gas resources for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a transit country for gas deliveries to europe the problem is that until now turkmenistan 's gas exports have to flow through russia to reach europe - there are simply no other gas pipelines . europe wants to support the construction of new pipelines that circumvent russia , but schmitz questioned the viability the proposal . " it remains to be seen whether turkmenistan will ever be able to transport gas directly to europe , " she said . what 's more , turkmenistan is still focusing more strongly on russia than on the eu , said oezdemir , who expressed doubts that europe could do much to change that . " as long as the eu does n't have a common energy policy itself , we wo n't have a chance to compete with russia as far as central asia and the energy corridor go , " he said . manfred goetzke -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus ceo tom enders rejected the allegations on wed , april 9 . enders stated that he and other officials were innocent of insider trading and called a report by french web news service mediapart which detailed the allegations incompetent , biased and unfair .
news of the probe into possible insider trading was leaked to the internet site which then published the allegations on tuesday , an act that enders called " shocking " and " unacceptable . "
" i know i have done nothing wrong nd i say the same for all the managers who are supposedly involved , " the airbus ceo told a news briefing in new zealand .
" i am absolutely convinced there was no wrong-doing .
we will demonstrate that the people who have done the investigation have n't done that in a competent way , " he said .
" we will defend our reputation and our rights to be presumed innocent with all means at our disposal , " he said .
" our names are dragged into the mud ... and we are sitting ducks .
so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .
airbus ceo calls french probe " biased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders believes the probe is driven by a conspiracy theory enders not only heavily criticized the online article but also the amf investigation itself , calling it " unfair " and " biased . "
" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "
the amf had previously announced that there was cause for action against several people at eads over alleged insider trading at the end of 2005 and in early 2006 , but did not release any names .
probe claims shares sold before delay made public the double-decker a380 is the largest passenger airline ever built , and has been the centerpiece of airbus efforts to compete with us rival boeing .
it made its first commercial flight in october after billions of dollars in cost over-runs and months of delays .

airbus ceo tom enders rejected the allegations on wed , april 9 . enders stated that he and other officials were innocent of insider trading and called a report by french web news service mediapart which detailed the allegations incompetent , biased and unfair .
news of the probe into possible insider trading was leaked to the internet site which then published the allegations on tuesday , an act that enders called " shocking " and " unacceptable . "
" i know i have done nothing wrong nd i say the same for all the managers who are supposedly involved , " the airbus ceo told a news briefing in new zealand .
" i am absolutely convinced there was no wrong-doing .
we will demonstrate that the people who have done the investigation have n't done that in a competent way , " he said .
" we will defend our reputation and our rights to be presumed innocent with all means at our disposal , " he said .
" our names are dragged into the mud ... and we are sitting ducks .
so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .
airbus ceo calls french probe " biased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders believes the probe is driven by a conspiracy theory enders not only heavily criticized the online article but also the amf investigation itself , calling it " unfair " and " biased . "
" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "
the amf had previously announced that there was cause for action against several people at eads over alleged insider trading at the end of 2005 and in early 2006 , but did not release any names .
probe claims shares sold before delay made public the double-decker a380 is the largest passenger airline ever built , and has been the centerpiece of airbus efforts to compete with us rival boeing .
it made its first commercial flight in october after billions of dollars in cost over-runs and months of delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 delays were known three months before going public in march 2006 , eads privately cut its 2007 delivery target for the new superjumbo aircraft .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 09.04.2008 oecd study urges germany to pursue reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy is expected to grow despite fears of a global recession the organization for economic cooperation and development says the german economic upswing is set to continue but warned berlin it had to undertake reforms in every sector , in particular education , to maintain its edge . germany had enjoyed a strong cyclical rebound after a long period of stagnation , the oecd said , adding that solid foundations had been laid for sustaining the upswing or at least mitigating the effects of financial market turmoil .
it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .
rising energy prices are another hot german issue at present .
incumbent companies currently have " considerable scope to make market entry for their competitors cumbersome and costly , " the oecd noted . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .
rising energy prices are another hot german issue at present .
incumbent companies currently have " considerable scope to make market entry for their competitors cumbersome and costly , " the oecd noted . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 09.04.2008 oecd study urges germany to pursue reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy is expected to grow despite fears of a global recession the organization for economic cooperation and development says the german economic upswing is set to continue but warned berlin it had to undertake reforms in every sector , in particular education , to maintain its edge . germany had enjoyed a strong cyclical rebound after a long period of stagnation , the oecd said , adding that solid foundations had been laid for sustaining the upswing or at least mitigating the effects of financial market turmoil .
it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .
rising energy prices are another hot german issue at present .
incumbent companies currently have " considerable scope to make market entry for their competitors cumbersome and costly , " the oecd noted . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ this is a great day for traffic safety and sends a signal for environmental protection , ” he added . the green party politician also said he would start talks with his counterparts in other states about introducing a national highway speed limit . activists cite environment , safety “ the danger of serious accidents involving personal injury is reduced wherever there is a speed limit , ” loske said . speed limits are not only good for the environment - at lower speeds , cars burn less fuel , expelling fewer greenhouse gas emissions - but they protect people , statistics show . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speeds are often limited on crowded road stretches german highways often have speed limits for noise reduction , where traffic is heavy , or at junctions .
currently , a little over half of german highways have no speed limits around germany . but the debate over a general speed limit on the german autobahn -lrb- the word simply means “ highway ” in german -rrb- is an ongoing one . proponents demand an overall limit of 120 or 130 kilometers per hour , citing environmental and safety reasons .
this past autumn , german environmental organizations and an alliance of police experts called “ pro-tempolimit ” got together to demand a speed limit . public opinion is divided but german automobile clubs as well as the german automobile industry - known for its heavy , fast and well-engineered vehicles , and the motor of a chunky segment of the german economy - oppose speed limits .

but with its focus on human rights , the eu is likely to have a tougher time wooing the region 's nations than russia and china . the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on wednesday , april 9 , in the turkmen capital ashgabat is well overdue .
china , russia and other former soviet states already staked their claim there long ago . china has negotiated a gas pipeline project with turkmenistan that , starting in 2009 , is to deliver 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually to the people 's republic .
india and iran have also discovered the " stans " in central asia as both suppliers of energy and a profitable new market . over a year ago , the eu joined in the race for energy reserves and market potential in central asia .
in june 2007 , the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia in an effort to strengthen ties with turkmenistan , uzbekistan and the neighboring countries . more than just political good intentions are at stake : turkmenistan is one of the world 's most important gas suppliers and kazakhstan has one of the 10 largest oil and gas reserves . bildunterschrift : the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia last summer eu ca n't afford to compromise on rights issues the focus of wednesday 's meeting between the eu ministers and their central asian counterparts , led by slovenian head diplomat dimitrij rupel , is to determine what shape a partnership should take . one thing is already clear : the negotiations wo n't be easy .
while countries like russia and china are exclusively concerned with business matters , the europeans want to help improve the human rights situation in the region , said cem oezdemir , the european parliament 's rapporteur on central asia . " we have to make it clear that we ca n't allow ourselves to become dependent at any price and throw our standards overboard , " said oezdemir , a european parliamentarian for the green party . if the eu were to avoid taking a clear stance against human rights abuses in countries like uzbekistan and kazakhstan , it would jeopardize its own credibility , he added , since restricting press freedom , getting rid of the opposition and holding bogus elections run contrary to what europe stands for . " we have to have the courage to address -lsb- human rights violations -rsb- , even if the other competitors are n't interested in that . " appeals for improvement are n't likely to go over well with the new strategic partners in central asia . trade and values do n't go hand in hand as part of the soviet union , the region was subject to moscow 's rule for decades , and political advice can easily be taken as indoctrination , said andrea schmitz from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would lose its credibility if it did n't stand up for rights " a transfer of values would mean that the values would have to materialize in the form of institutions that represent them , but the elites in these countries simply seem to be lacking the political will , " said schmitz . despite the problems , there is interest among central asian nations to cooperate more closely with europe and seek new trade partners and european investors , in part to minimize their reliance on china and russia , schmitz said . " because of russia 's and china 's dominance and the resources they use to exercise power in central asia , the countries want to establish counterweights . " some central asian countries have already succeeded in doing just that . kazakhstan for instance has already attracted numerous german mid-sized companies . " growth rates are enormous , " said gerd herx , director of the german office for foreign trade .
" we have deliveries to kazakhstan with a trade volume of about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- . "
herx said he sees strong chances for european enterprisers in uzbekistan as well . while trade improves between the eu and central asia , many european entrepreneurs are hesitant about investing directly in the region , schmitz said , because of huge legal uncertainties . no direct pipelines to europe it 's likely to be even more difficult for the eu to push through its interests regarding energy policy .
europe wants to become more independent of russian gas and has had its eye on turkmenistan 's plentiful gas resources for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a transit country for gas deliveries to europe the problem is that until now turkmenistan 's gas exports have to flow through russia to reach europe - there are simply no other gas pipelines . europe wants to support the construction of new pipelines that circumvent russia , but schmitz questioned the viability the proposal . " it remains to be seen whether turkmenistan will ever be able to transport gas directly to europe , " she said . what 's more , turkmenistan is still focusing more strongly on russia than on the eu , said oezdemir , who expressed doubts that europe could do much to change that . " as long as the eu does n't have a common energy policy itself , we wo n't have a chance to compete with russia as far as central asia and the energy corridor go , " he said . manfred goetzke -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus ceo tom enders rejected the allegations on wed , april 9 . enders stated that he and other officials were innocent of insider trading and called a report by french web news service mediapart which detailed the allegations incompetent , biased and unfair .
news of the probe into possible insider trading was leaked to the internet site which then published the allegations on tuesday , an act that enders called " shocking " and " unacceptable . "
" i know i have done nothing wrong nd i say the same for all the managers who are supposedly involved , " the airbus ceo told a news briefing in new zealand .
" i am absolutely convinced there was no wrong-doing .
we will demonstrate that the people who have done the investigation have n't done that in a competent way , " he said .
" we will defend our reputation and our rights to be presumed innocent with all means at our disposal , " he said .
" our names are dragged into the mud ... and we are sitting ducks .
so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .
airbus ceo calls french probe " biased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders believes the probe is driven by a conspiracy theory enders not only heavily criticized the online article but also the amf investigation itself , calling it " unfair " and " biased . "
" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "
the amf had previously announced that there was cause for action against several people at eads over alleged insider trading at the end of 2005 and in early 2006 , but did not release any names .
probe claims shares sold before delay made public the double-decker a380 is the largest passenger airline ever built , and has been the centerpiece of airbus efforts to compete with us rival boeing .
it made its first commercial flight in october after billions of dollars in cost over-runs and months of delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 delays were known three months before going public in march 2006 , eads privately cut its 2007 delivery target for the new superjumbo aircraft .
later that month , lagardere and what was then daimlerchrysler said they would each sell a 7.5 percent stake in eads .
the a380 delays were publicly announced in june 2006 , sending the eads share price down more than 26 percent .
the amf said shortly after that it was looking at certain previous stock deals , and in july 2006 , forgeard stepped down .
he has denied any wrongdoing .
the french government , which has a 15 percent stake in eads , has insisted its conduct in the matter has been " beyond reproach . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i know i have done nothing wrong nd i say the same for all the managers who are supposedly involved , " the airbus ceo told a news briefing in new zealand .
" i am absolutely convinced there was no wrong-doing .
we will demonstrate that the people who have done the investigation have n't done that in a competent way , " he said .
" we will defend our reputation and our rights to be presumed innocent with all means at our disposal , " he said .
" our names are dragged into the mud ... and we are sitting ducks .
so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .

" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "

“ the propaganda show that the chinese have planned -lrb- with their relay race -rrb- is turning into a race through a gauntlet , ” thilo hoppe , the head of the bundestag 's committee on economic cooperation and development , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch run has met with protests in paris ...
hoppe and other representatives from the parliamentary committee spent nine days in nepal on a fact-finding mission ahead of a general election . because of the ongoing demonstrations of exiled tibetans in nepal , however , the lawmakers met with tibetan exiles living in the nepalese capital katmandu , in particular the representative of the dalai lama .
tibet 's demand for cultural autonomy hoppe said the exiles were demanding more cultural autonomy for tibet , rather than complete independence from china - a stance he finds " moderate . "
“ i support a nonviolent movement for more autonomy within china , ” hoppe said .
he warned that china " should make use of the dalai lama 's modest position ...
if some day he is no longer the representative of tibet , it could be someone else who is more radical , and who could demand complete independence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... as well as san francisco .
some are calling to stop the relay hoppe also repeated claims of the tibetan exiles , that monasteries in tibet had been cut off from the outside world by chinese military forces , and were suffering serious food and medicine shortages .
this had even cost lives .
" no one can get any wares in or out - the monasteries are surrounded , " the lawmaker said .
" this has been the cause of at least one , possibly two , deaths . "
when the delegation tried to talk to the nepali regime about the rights of the tibetan exiles to hold demonstrations in nepal , they were met with shrugs by a representative of the nepali government . " the chinese ambassador to nepal had demanded the government to forbid so-called anti-chinese manifestations , " hoppe said .
" when we pointed out that there are international accords granting this right , he simply said , ' that may be so , but china is big and nepal is small ' . " peaceful demonstrations ?
in addition , the tibetan exiles that met with the german delegation insisited that protests against chinese rule had been overwhelmingly peaceful .
but some violent protests had been staged by chinese security forces , who had dressed up in monks ' robes .
those protests - showing monks setting fire to automobiles and breaking windows - were shown on chinese state television , to show the dalai lama and his adherents in a violent light , they said .
the exiled tibetans showed the parliamentarians photographs of chinese soldiers carrying monks ' robes in their luggage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo hoppe hopes the torch uproar will affect china despite these problems , hoppe said he thinks it is too early to declare a boycott against the beijing olympics ; to do so at this point “ would only make things worse for the tibetans . ”
“ but it is equally wrong to categorically refuse a boycott , ” he said .
it is important for the chinese to save their olympic games , so politicians should think carefully about whether or not they want to take part in the opening ceremonies , hoppe said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some argue that singling out one minority is unfair . five years after iraqi dictator saddam hussein was ousted , the sunni and shiite muslim communities seem to be united on at least one front - their hatred of christians . germany 's catholic and protestant churches are alarmed about rising sectarian violence being committed against christians in iraq .
bombed churches , beheaded clergymen , and massacres of women and children : according to observers , the very existence of this religious minority , which has been settled in iraq for nearly 2,000 years , is threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving alms is a christian value , in iraq as elsewhere as a result , german churches are calling on the government to open the borders for persecuted christians from iraq . worsening situation for christians " the churches ask for a relevant number of christians and other non-muslim religious groups , " said nele allenberg , a legal expert from germany 's protestant church . " there are around 180,000 christian refugees in iraq 's neighboring countries - that is syria , jordan and also turkey .
germany would have to take in a big part of these people , meaning 20,000 to 30,000 people , " allenberg said . she said the situation for iraqi christians today is significantly worse than before saddam hussein was ousted from power five years ago , when the country 's christians lived peacefully side by side with sunni and shiite muslims . now christians tend to be associated with american and british invaders , who many muslims believed would be waging a modern-day crusade against islam .

but actually the situation is worse . " greens : ' we have to help everybody ' negotiations are underway within the german government and parliament , to sort out numbers and procedures for such a resettlement program , and there is political consensus that swift action is urgently needed . but some warn that christians are not the only ones suffering , and say they should not be singled out in a time of humanitarian crisis . germany 's green party endorses the plan , but says opening the gates only for christians is hypocritical .
volker beck , a senior green party lawmaker , criticized germany 's ruling coalition for being willing to take in christians from iraq , but not other refugees . " we have to help everybody who is persecuted and can not say these are our christian brothers and sisters , and for others with a different identity we do n't care , " beck said . the churches say they share this view , but that first they have to push for what can be achieved politically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches in iraq have suffered bombing attacks meanwhile , iraqi christians warn that time is running out , as refugees in countries bordering on iraq are under mounting pressure to return home to a hostile environment . those iraqi christians who have made it to germany - often after great travails - are hoping the state of legal limbo they are currently in will soon come to an end . refugees face long road , live in fear aida , a 39-year-old refugee who did not want to disclose her full name , said she is still fearful even though she has been out of iraq for two years . she arrived in germany after a long trip via turkey and greece . she 's afraid that more of her relatives will share the brutal fate of one of her cousins , who was killed by a mob of muslim youngsters in the streets of baghdad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.04.2008 eu walks fine line on trade and human rights in central asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to lower its reliance on russian oil and explore new energy sources europe has belatedly discovered central asia as an energy supplier .
but with its focus on human rights , the eu is likely to have a tougher time wooing the region 's nations than russia and china . the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on wednesday , april 9 , in the turkmen capital ashgabat is well overdue .
china , russia and other former soviet states already staked their claim there long ago . china has negotiated a gas pipeline project with turkmenistan that , starting in 2009 , is to deliver 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually to the people 's republic .
india and iran have also discovered the " stans " in central asia as both suppliers of energy and a profitable new market . over a year ago , the eu joined in the race for energy reserves and market potential in central asia .
in june 2007 , the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia in an effort to strengthen ties with turkmenistan , uzbekistan and the neighboring countries . more than just political good intentions are at stake : turkmenistan is one of the world 's most important gas suppliers and kazakhstan has one of the 10 largest oil and gas reserves . bildunterschrift : the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia last summer eu ca n't afford to compromise on rights issues the focus of wednesday 's meeting between the eu ministers and their central asian counterparts , led by slovenian head diplomat dimitrij rupel , is to determine what shape a partnership should take . one thing is already clear : the negotiations wo n't be easy .
while countries like russia and china are exclusively concerned with business matters , the europeans want to help improve the human rights situation in the region , said cem oezdemir , the european parliament 's rapporteur on central asia . " we have to make it clear that we ca n't allow ourselves to become dependent at any price and throw our standards overboard , " said oezdemir , a european parliamentarian for the green party . if the eu were to avoid taking a clear stance against human rights abuses in countries like uzbekistan and kazakhstan , it would jeopardize its own credibility , he added , since restricting press freedom , getting rid of the opposition and holding bogus elections run contrary to what europe stands for . " we have to have the courage to address -lsb- human rights violations -rsb- , even if the other competitors are n't interested in that . " appeals for improvement are n't likely to go over well with the new strategic partners in central asia . trade and values do n't go hand in hand as part of the soviet union , the region was subject to moscow 's rule for decades , and political advice can easily be taken as indoctrination , said andrea schmitz from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would lose its credibility if it did n't stand up for rights " a transfer of values would mean that the values would have to materialize in the form of institutions that represent them , but the elites in these countries simply seem to be lacking the political will , " said schmitz . despite the problems , there is interest among central asian nations to cooperate more closely with europe and seek new trade partners and european investors , in part to minimize their reliance on china and russia , schmitz said . " because of russia 's and china 's dominance and the resources they use to exercise power in central asia , the countries want to establish counterweights . " some central asian countries have already succeeded in doing just that . kazakhstan for instance has already attracted numerous german mid-sized companies . " growth rates are enormous , " said gerd herx , director of the german office for foreign trade .
" we have deliveries to kazakhstan with a trade volume of about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- . "
herx said he sees strong chances for european enterprisers in uzbekistan as well . while trade improves between the eu and central asia , many european entrepreneurs are hesitant about investing directly in the region , schmitz said , because of huge legal uncertainties . no direct pipelines to europe it 's likely to be even more difficult for the eu to push through its interests regarding energy policy .
europe wants to become more independent of russian gas and has had its eye on turkmenistan 's plentiful gas resources for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a transit country for gas deliveries to europe the problem is that until now turkmenistan 's gas exports have to flow through russia to reach europe - there are simply no other gas pipelines . europe wants to support the construction of new pipelines that circumvent russia , but schmitz questioned the viability the proposal . " it remains to be seen whether turkmenistan will ever be able to transport gas directly to europe , " she said . what 's more , turkmenistan is still focusing more strongly on russia than on the eu , said oezdemir , who expressed doubts that europe could do much to change that . " as long as the eu does n't have a common energy policy itself , we wo n't have a chance to compete with russia as far as central asia and the energy corridor go , " he said . manfred goetzke -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .

it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .
rising energy prices are another hot german issue at present .
incumbent companies currently have " considerable scope to make market entry for their competitors cumbersome and costly , " the oecd noted . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus ceo tom enders rejected the allegations on wed , april 9 . enders stated that he and other officials were innocent of insider trading and called a report by french web news service mediapart which detailed the allegations incompetent , biased and unfair .
news of the probe into possible insider trading was leaked to the internet site which then published the allegations on tuesday , an act that enders called " shocking " and " unacceptable . "
" i know i have done nothing wrong nd i say the same for all the managers who are supposedly involved , " the airbus ceo told a news briefing in new zealand .
" i am absolutely convinced there was no wrong-doing .
we will demonstrate that the people who have done the investigation have n't done that in a competent way , " he said .
" we will defend our reputation and our rights to be presumed innocent with all means at our disposal , " he said .
" our names are dragged into the mud ... and we are sitting ducks .
so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .
airbus ceo calls french probe " biased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders believes the probe is driven by a conspiracy theory enders not only heavily criticized the online article but also the amf investigation itself , calling it " unfair " and " biased . "
" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "
the amf had previously announced that there was cause for action against several people at eads over alleged insider trading at the end of 2005 and in early 2006 , but did not release any names .
probe claims shares sold before delay made public the double-decker a380 is the largest passenger airline ever built , and has been the centerpiece of airbus efforts to compete with us rival boeing .
it made its first commercial flight in october after billions of dollars in cost over-runs and months of delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 delays were known three months before going public in march 2006 , eads privately cut its 2007 delivery target for the new superjumbo aircraft .
later that month , lagardere and what was then daimlerchrysler said they would each sell a 7.5 percent stake in eads .
the a380 delays were publicly announced in june 2006 , sending the eads share price down more than 26 percent .
the amf said shortly after that it was looking at certain previous stock deals , and in july 2006 , forgeard stepped down .
he has denied any wrongdoing .
the french government , which has a 15 percent stake in eads , has insisted its conduct in the matter has been " beyond reproach . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ this is a great day for traffic safety and sends a signal for environmental protection , ” he added . the green party politician also said he would start talks with his counterparts in other states about introducing a national highway speed limit . activists cite environment , safety “ the danger of serious accidents involving personal injury is reduced wherever there is a speed limit , ” loske said . speed limits are not only good for the environment - at lower speeds , cars burn less fuel , expelling fewer greenhouse gas emissions - but they protect people , statistics show . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speeds are often limited on crowded road stretches german highways often have speed limits for noise reduction , where traffic is heavy , or at junctions .
currently , a little over half of german highways have no speed limits around germany . but the debate over a general speed limit on the german autobahn -lrb- the word simply means “ highway ” in german -rrb- is an ongoing one . proponents demand an overall limit of 120 or 130 kilometers per hour , citing environmental and safety reasons .
this past autumn , german environmental organizations and an alliance of police experts called “ pro-tempolimit ” got together to demand a speed limit . public opinion is divided but german automobile clubs as well as the german automobile industry - known for its heavy , fast and well-engineered vehicles , and the motor of a chunky segment of the german economy - oppose speed limits .
chancellor angela merkel also came out on the side of the auto industry , in opposition to speed limits . public opinion is nearly evenly divided on the issue . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .

airbus ceo tom enders rejected the allegations on wed , april 9 . enders stated that he and other officials were innocent of insider trading and called a report by french web news service mediapart which detailed the allegations incompetent , biased and unfair .
news of the probe into possible insider trading was leaked to the internet site which then published the allegations on tuesday , an act that enders called " shocking " and " unacceptable . "
" i know i have done nothing wrong nd i say the same for all the managers who are supposedly involved , " the airbus ceo told a news briefing in new zealand .
" i am absolutely convinced there was no wrong-doing .
we will demonstrate that the people who have done the investigation have n't done that in a competent way , " he said .
" we will defend our reputation and our rights to be presumed innocent with all means at our disposal , " he said .
" our names are dragged into the mud ... and we are sitting ducks .
so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .
airbus ceo calls french probe " biased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders believes the probe is driven by a conspiracy theory enders not only heavily criticized the online article but also the amf investigation itself , calling it " unfair " and " biased . "
" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "
the amf had previously announced that there was cause for action against several people at eads over alleged insider trading at the end of 2005 and in early 2006 , but did not release any names .
probe claims shares sold before delay made public the double-decker a380 is the largest passenger airline ever built , and has been the centerpiece of airbus efforts to compete with us rival boeing .
it made its first commercial flight in october after billions of dollars in cost over-runs and months of delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 delays were known three months before going public in march 2006 , eads privately cut its 2007 delivery target for the new superjumbo aircraft .
later that month , lagardere and what was then daimlerchrysler said they would each sell a 7.5 percent stake in eads .
the a380 delays were publicly announced in june 2006 , sending the eads share price down more than 26 percent .
the amf said shortly after that it was looking at certain previous stock deals , and in july 2006 , forgeard stepped down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 09.04.2008 in nepal visit , lawmakers focus on tibet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nepalese police arrested tibetans protesting in front of the un office there a visit to nepal gave german lawmakers insights into the difficult situation for tibetan monks , but did not lead to calls for an olympic boycott . a german lawmaker said he hoped the international protests against china 's olympic torch relay would have an effect on chinese policy , considering how badly it reflected on the chinese regime .
“ the propaganda show that the chinese have planned -lrb- with their relay race -rrb- is turning into a race through a gauntlet , ” thilo hoppe , the head of the bundestag 's committee on economic cooperation and development , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch run has met with protests in paris ...
hoppe and other representatives from the parliamentary committee spent nine days in nepal on a fact-finding mission ahead of a general election . because of the ongoing demonstrations of exiled tibetans in nepal , however , the lawmakers met with tibetan exiles living in the nepalese capital katmandu , in particular the representative of the dalai lama .
tibet 's demand for cultural autonomy hoppe said the exiles were demanding more cultural autonomy for tibet , rather than complete independence from china - a stance he finds " moderate . "
“ i support a nonviolent movement for more autonomy within china , ” hoppe said .
he warned that china " should make use of the dalai lama 's modest position ...
if some day he is no longer the representative of tibet , it could be someone else who is more radical , and who could demand complete independence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... as well as san francisco .
some are calling to stop the relay hoppe also repeated claims of the tibetan exiles , that monasteries in tibet had been cut off from the outside world by chinese military forces , and were suffering serious food and medicine shortages .
this had even cost lives .
" no one can get any wares in or out - the monasteries are surrounded , " the lawmaker said .
" this has been the cause of at least one , possibly two , deaths . "
when the delegation tried to talk to the nepali regime about the rights of the tibetan exiles to hold demonstrations in nepal , they were met with shrugs by a representative of the nepali government . " the chinese ambassador to nepal had demanded the government to forbid so-called anti-chinese manifestations , " hoppe said .
" when we pointed out that there are international accords granting this right , he simply said , ' that may be so , but china is big and nepal is small ' . " peaceful demonstrations ?
in addition , the tibetan exiles that met with the german delegation insisited that protests against chinese rule had been overwhelmingly peaceful .
but some violent protests had been staged by chinese security forces , who had dressed up in monks ' robes .
those protests - showing monks setting fire to automobiles and breaking windows - were shown on chinese state television , to show the dalai lama and his adherents in a violent light , they said .
the exiled tibetans showed the parliamentarians photographs of chinese soldiers carrying monks ' robes in their luggage .

it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .

it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .
rising energy prices are another hot german issue at present .
incumbent companies currently have " considerable scope to make market entry for their competitors cumbersome and costly , " the oecd noted . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus ceo tom enders rejected the allegations on wed , april 9 . enders stated that he and other officials were innocent of insider trading and called a report by french web news service mediapart which detailed the allegations incompetent , biased and unfair .
news of the probe into possible insider trading was leaked to the internet site which then published the allegations on tuesday , an act that enders called " shocking " and " unacceptable . "
" i know i have done nothing wrong nd i say the same for all the managers who are supposedly involved , " the airbus ceo told a news briefing in new zealand .
" i am absolutely convinced there was no wrong-doing .
we will demonstrate that the people who have done the investigation have n't done that in a competent way , " he said .
" we will defend our reputation and our rights to be presumed innocent with all means at our disposal , " he said .
" our names are dragged into the mud ... and we are sitting ducks .
so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .
airbus ceo calls french probe " biased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders believes the probe is driven by a conspiracy theory enders not only heavily criticized the online article but also the amf investigation itself , calling it " unfair " and " biased . "
" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "
the amf had previously announced that there was cause for action against several people at eads over alleged insider trading at the end of 2005 and in early 2006 , but did not release any names .
probe claims shares sold before delay made public the double-decker a380 is the largest passenger airline ever built , and has been the centerpiece of airbus efforts to compete with us rival boeing .
it made its first commercial flight in october after billions of dollars in cost over-runs and months of delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 delays were known three months before going public in march 2006 , eads privately cut its 2007 delivery target for the new superjumbo aircraft .
later that month , lagardere and what was then daimlerchrysler said they would each sell a 7.5 percent stake in eads .
the a380 delays were publicly announced in june 2006 , sending the eads share price down more than 26 percent .
the amf said shortly after that it was looking at certain previous stock deals , and in july 2006 , forgeard stepped down .
he has denied any wrongdoing .
the french government , which has a 15 percent stake in eads , has insisted its conduct in the matter has been " beyond reproach . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany would have to take in a big part of these people , meaning 20,000 to 30,000 people , " allenberg said . she said the situation for iraqi christians today is significantly worse than before saddam hussein was ousted from power five years ago , when the country 's christians lived peacefully side by side with sunni and shiite muslims . now christians tend to be associated with american and british invaders , who many muslims believed would be waging a modern-day crusade against islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria has been flooded with iraqi christian refugees the chairman of the council of the protestant church in germany , bishop wolfgang huber , made a similar point in his good friday prayers .
he named the atrocities that have been visited upon iraqi christians and noted : " the constitution allows all religious groups , so on paper the situation should be better .
but actually the situation is worse . " greens : ' we have to help everybody ' negotiations are underway within the german government and parliament , to sort out numbers and procedures for such a resettlement program , and there is political consensus that swift action is urgently needed . but some warn that christians are not the only ones suffering , and say they should not be singled out in a time of humanitarian crisis . germany 's green party endorses the plan , but says opening the gates only for christians is hypocritical .
volker beck , a senior green party lawmaker , criticized germany 's ruling coalition for being willing to take in christians from iraq , but not other refugees . " we have to help everybody who is persecuted and can not say these are our christian brothers and sisters , and for others with a different identity we do n't care , " beck said . the churches say they share this view , but that first they have to push for what can be achieved politically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches in iraq have suffered bombing attacks meanwhile , iraqi christians warn that time is running out , as refugees in countries bordering on iraq are under mounting pressure to return home to a hostile environment . those iraqi christians who have made it to germany - often after great travails - are hoping the state of legal limbo they are currently in will soon come to an end . refugees face long road , live in fear aida , a 39-year-old refugee who did not want to disclose her full name , said she is still fearful even though she has been out of iraq for two years . she arrived in germany after a long trip via turkey and greece . she 's afraid that more of her relatives will share the brutal fate of one of her cousins , who was killed by a mob of muslim youngsters in the streets of baghdad . " they killed him and left him in the street , " aida said .
" after that i decided to leave my country and come here , because my father and my mother , and my sisters are here . " under eu rules , however , they are illegal aliens and would have to leave germany . uwe hessler -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 09.04.2008 germany feels pressure to aid more christian iraqis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq once had 1.4 million christians , but numbers have shrunk dramatically germany is debating whether to give visas to more iraqi christian refugees , given their widespread mistreatment at home .
but some argue that singling out one minority is unfair . five years after iraqi dictator saddam hussein was ousted , the sunni and shiite muslim communities seem to be united on at least one front - their hatred of christians . germany 's catholic and protestant churches are alarmed about rising sectarian violence being committed against christians in iraq .
bombed churches , beheaded clergymen , and massacres of women and children : according to observers , the very existence of this religious minority , which has been settled in iraq for nearly 2,000 years , is threatened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving alms is a christian value , in iraq as elsewhere as a result , german churches are calling on the government to open the borders for persecuted christians from iraq . worsening situation for christians " the churches ask for a relevant number of christians and other non-muslim religious groups , " said nele allenberg , a legal expert from germany 's protestant church . " there are around 180,000 christian refugees in iraq 's neighboring countries - that is syria , jordan and also turkey .
germany would have to take in a big part of these people , meaning 20,000 to 30,000 people , " allenberg said . she said the situation for iraqi christians today is significantly worse than before saddam hussein was ousted from power five years ago , when the country 's christians lived peacefully side by side with sunni and shiite muslims . now christians tend to be associated with american and british invaders , who many muslims believed would be waging a modern-day crusade against islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria has been flooded with iraqi christian refugees the chairman of the council of the protestant church in germany , bishop wolfgang huber , made a similar point in his good friday prayers .

but with its focus on human rights , the eu is likely to have a tougher time wooing the region 's nations than russia and china . the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on wednesday , april 9 , in the turkmen capital ashgabat is well overdue .
china , russia and other former soviet states already staked their claim there long ago . china has negotiated a gas pipeline project with turkmenistan that , starting in 2009 , is to deliver 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually to the people 's republic .
india and iran have also discovered the " stans " in central asia as both suppliers of energy and a profitable new market . over a year ago , the eu joined in the race for energy reserves and market potential in central asia .
in june 2007 , the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia in an effort to strengthen ties with turkmenistan , uzbekistan and the neighboring countries . more than just political good intentions are at stake : turkmenistan is one of the world 's most important gas suppliers and kazakhstan has one of the 10 largest oil and gas reserves . bildunterschrift : the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia last summer eu ca n't afford to compromise on rights issues the focus of wednesday 's meeting between the eu ministers and their central asian counterparts , led by slovenian head diplomat dimitrij rupel , is to determine what shape a partnership should take . one thing is already clear : the negotiations wo n't be easy .
while countries like russia and china are exclusively concerned with business matters , the europeans want to help improve the human rights situation in the region , said cem oezdemir , the european parliament 's rapporteur on central asia . " we have to make it clear that we ca n't allow ourselves to become dependent at any price and throw our standards overboard , " said oezdemir , a european parliamentarian for the green party . if the eu were to avoid taking a clear stance against human rights abuses in countries like uzbekistan and kazakhstan , it would jeopardize its own credibility , he added , since restricting press freedom , getting rid of the opposition and holding bogus elections run contrary to what europe stands for . " we have to have the courage to address -lsb- human rights violations -rsb- , even if the other competitors are n't interested in that . " appeals for improvement are n't likely to go over well with the new strategic partners in central asia . trade and values do n't go hand in hand as part of the soviet union , the region was subject to moscow 's rule for decades , and political advice can easily be taken as indoctrination , said andrea schmitz from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would lose its credibility if it did n't stand up for rights " a transfer of values would mean that the values would have to materialize in the form of institutions that represent them , but the elites in these countries simply seem to be lacking the political will , " said schmitz . despite the problems , there is interest among central asian nations to cooperate more closely with europe and seek new trade partners and european investors , in part to minimize their reliance on china and russia , schmitz said . " because of russia 's and china 's dominance and the resources they use to exercise power in central asia , the countries want to establish counterweights . " some central asian countries have already succeeded in doing just that . kazakhstan for instance has already attracted numerous german mid-sized companies . " growth rates are enormous , " said gerd herx , director of the german office for foreign trade .
" we have deliveries to kazakhstan with a trade volume of about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- . "
herx said he sees strong chances for european enterprisers in uzbekistan as well . while trade improves between the eu and central asia , many european entrepreneurs are hesitant about investing directly in the region , schmitz said , because of huge legal uncertainties . no direct pipelines to europe it 's likely to be even more difficult for the eu to push through its interests regarding energy policy .
europe wants to become more independent of russian gas and has had its eye on turkmenistan 's plentiful gas resources for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a transit country for gas deliveries to europe the problem is that until now turkmenistan 's gas exports have to flow through russia to reach europe - there are simply no other gas pipelines . europe wants to support the construction of new pipelines that circumvent russia , but schmitz questioned the viability the proposal . " it remains to be seen whether turkmenistan will ever be able to transport gas directly to europe , " she said . what 's more , turkmenistan is still focusing more strongly on russia than on the eu , said oezdemir , who expressed doubts that europe could do much to change that . " as long as the eu does n't have a common energy policy itself , we wo n't have a chance to compete with russia as far as central asia and the energy corridor go , " he said . manfred goetzke -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with its focus on human rights , the eu is likely to have a tougher time wooing the region 's nations than russia and china . the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on wednesday , april 9 , in the turkmen capital ashgabat is well overdue .
china , russia and other former soviet states already staked their claim there long ago . china has negotiated a gas pipeline project with turkmenistan that , starting in 2009 , is to deliver 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually to the people 's republic .
india and iran have also discovered the " stans " in central asia as both suppliers of energy and a profitable new market . over a year ago , the eu joined in the race for energy reserves and market potential in central asia .
in june 2007 , the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia in an effort to strengthen ties with turkmenistan , uzbekistan and the neighboring countries . more than just political good intentions are at stake : turkmenistan is one of the world 's most important gas suppliers and kazakhstan has one of the 10 largest oil and gas reserves . bildunterschrift : the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia last summer eu ca n't afford to compromise on rights issues the focus of wednesday 's meeting between the eu ministers and their central asian counterparts , led by slovenian head diplomat dimitrij rupel , is to determine what shape a partnership should take . one thing is already clear : the negotiations wo n't be easy .
while countries like russia and china are exclusively concerned with business matters , the europeans want to help improve the human rights situation in the region , said cem oezdemir , the european parliament 's rapporteur on central asia . " we have to make it clear that we ca n't allow ourselves to become dependent at any price and throw our standards overboard , " said oezdemir , a european parliamentarian for the green party . if the eu were to avoid taking a clear stance against human rights abuses in countries like uzbekistan and kazakhstan , it would jeopardize its own credibility , he added , since restricting press freedom , getting rid of the opposition and holding bogus elections run contrary to what europe stands for . " we have to have the courage to address -lsb- human rights violations -rsb- , even if the other competitors are n't interested in that . " appeals for improvement are n't likely to go over well with the new strategic partners in central asia . trade and values do n't go hand in hand as part of the soviet union , the region was subject to moscow 's rule for decades , and political advice can easily be taken as indoctrination , said andrea schmitz from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would lose its credibility if it did n't stand up for rights " a transfer of values would mean that the values would have to materialize in the form of institutions that represent them , but the elites in these countries simply seem to be lacking the political will , " said schmitz . despite the problems , there is interest among central asian nations to cooperate more closely with europe and seek new trade partners and european investors , in part to minimize their reliance on china and russia , schmitz said . " because of russia 's and china 's dominance and the resources they use to exercise power in central asia , the countries want to establish counterweights .

" we have to make it clear that we ca n't allow ourselves to become dependent at any price and throw our standards overboard , " said oezdemir , a european parliamentarian for the green party . if the eu were to avoid taking a clear stance against human rights abuses in countries like uzbekistan and kazakhstan , it would jeopardize its own credibility , he added , since restricting press freedom , getting rid of the opposition and holding bogus elections run contrary to what europe stands for . " we have to have the courage to address -lsb- human rights violations -rsb- , even if the other competitors are n't interested in that . " appeals for improvement are n't likely to go over well with the new strategic partners in central asia . trade and values do n't go hand in hand as part of the soviet union , the region was subject to moscow 's rule for decades , and political advice can easily be taken as indoctrination , said andrea schmitz from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would lose its credibility if it did n't stand up for rights " a transfer of values would mean that the values would have to materialize in the form of institutions that represent them , but the elites in these countries simply seem to be lacking the political will , " said schmitz . despite the problems , there is interest among central asian nations to cooperate more closely with europe and seek new trade partners and european investors , in part to minimize their reliance on china and russia , schmitz said . " because of russia 's and china 's dominance and the resources they use to exercise power in central asia , the countries want to establish counterweights . " some central asian countries have already succeeded in doing just that . kazakhstan for instance has already attracted numerous german mid-sized companies . " growth rates are enormous , " said gerd herx , director of the german office for foreign trade .
" we have deliveries to kazakhstan with a trade volume of about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- . "
herx said he sees strong chances for european enterprisers in uzbekistan as well . while trade improves between the eu and central asia , many european entrepreneurs are hesitant about investing directly in the region , schmitz said , because of huge legal uncertainties . no direct pipelines to europe it 's likely to be even more difficult for the eu to push through its interests regarding energy policy .
europe wants to become more independent of russian gas and has had its eye on turkmenistan 's plentiful gas resources for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a transit country for gas deliveries to europe the problem is that until now turkmenistan 's gas exports have to flow through russia to reach europe - there are simply no other gas pipelines . europe wants to support the construction of new pipelines that circumvent russia , but schmitz questioned the viability the proposal . " it remains to be seen whether turkmenistan will ever be able to transport gas directly to europe , " she said . what 's more , turkmenistan is still focusing more strongly on russia than on the eu , said oezdemir , who expressed doubts that europe could do much to change that . " as long as the eu does n't have a common energy policy itself , we wo n't have a chance to compete with russia as far as central asia and the energy corridor go , " he said . manfred goetzke -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus ceo tom enders rejected the allegations on wed , april 9 . enders stated that he and other officials were innocent of insider trading and called a report by french web news service mediapart which detailed the allegations incompetent , biased and unfair .
news of the probe into possible insider trading was leaked to the internet site which then published the allegations on tuesday , an act that enders called " shocking " and " unacceptable . "
" i know i have done nothing wrong nd i say the same for all the managers who are supposedly involved , " the airbus ceo told a news briefing in new zealand .
" i am absolutely convinced there was no wrong-doing .
we will demonstrate that the people who have done the investigation have n't done that in a competent way , " he said .
" we will defend our reputation and our rights to be presumed innocent with all means at our disposal , " he said .
" our names are dragged into the mud ... and we are sitting ducks .
so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .
airbus ceo calls french probe " biased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders believes the probe is driven by a conspiracy theory enders not only heavily criticized the online article but also the amf investigation itself , calling it " unfair " and " biased . "
" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "
the amf had previously announced that there was cause for action against several people at eads over alleged insider trading at the end of 2005 and in early 2006 , but did not release any names .
probe claims shares sold before delay made public the double-decker a380 is the largest passenger airline ever built , and has been the centerpiece of airbus efforts to compete with us rival boeing .
it made its first commercial flight in october after billions of dollars in cost over-runs and months of delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 delays were known three months before going public in march 2006 , eads privately cut its 2007 delivery target for the new superjumbo aircraft .
later that month , lagardere and what was then daimlerchrysler said they would each sell a 7.5 percent stake in eads .
the a380 delays were publicly announced in june 2006 , sending the eads share price down more than 26 percent .
the amf said shortly after that it was looking at certain previous stock deals , and in july 2006 , forgeard stepped down .
he has denied any wrongdoing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.04.2008 eu walks fine line on trade and human rights in central asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to lower its reliance on russian oil and explore new energy sources europe has belatedly discovered central asia as an energy supplier .
but with its focus on human rights , the eu is likely to have a tougher time wooing the region 's nations than russia and china . the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on wednesday , april 9 , in the turkmen capital ashgabat is well overdue .
china , russia and other former soviet states already staked their claim there long ago . china has negotiated a gas pipeline project with turkmenistan that , starting in 2009 , is to deliver 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually to the people 's republic .
india and iran have also discovered the " stans " in central asia as both suppliers of energy and a profitable new market . over a year ago , the eu joined in the race for energy reserves and market potential in central asia .
in june 2007 , the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia in an effort to strengthen ties with turkmenistan , uzbekistan and the neighboring countries . more than just political good intentions are at stake : turkmenistan is one of the world 's most important gas suppliers and kazakhstan has one of the 10 largest oil and gas reserves . bildunterschrift : the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia last summer eu ca n't afford to compromise on rights issues the focus of wednesday 's meeting between the eu ministers and their central asian counterparts , led by slovenian head diplomat dimitrij rupel , is to determine what shape a partnership should take . one thing is already clear : the negotiations wo n't be easy .
while countries like russia and china are exclusively concerned with business matters , the europeans want to help improve the human rights situation in the region , said cem oezdemir , the european parliament 's rapporteur on central asia . " we have to make it clear that we ca n't allow ourselves to become dependent at any price and throw our standards overboard , " said oezdemir , a european parliamentarian for the green party . if the eu were to avoid taking a clear stance against human rights abuses in countries like uzbekistan and kazakhstan , it would jeopardize its own credibility , he added , since restricting press freedom , getting rid of the opposition and holding bogus elections run contrary to what europe stands for . " we have to have the courage to address -lsb- human rights violations -rsb- , even if the other competitors are n't interested in that . " appeals for improvement are n't likely to go over well with the new strategic partners in central asia . trade and values do n't go hand in hand as part of the soviet union , the region was subject to moscow 's rule for decades , and political advice can easily be taken as indoctrination , said andrea schmitz from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would lose its credibility if it did n't stand up for rights " a transfer of values would mean that the values would have to materialize in the form of institutions that represent them , but the elites in these countries simply seem to be lacking the political will , " said schmitz . despite the problems , there is interest among central asian nations to cooperate more closely with europe and seek new trade partners and european investors , in part to minimize their reliance on china and russia , schmitz said . " because of russia 's and china 's dominance and the resources they use to exercise power in central asia , the countries want to establish counterweights . " some central asian countries have already succeeded in doing just that . kazakhstan for instance has already attracted numerous german mid-sized companies . " growth rates are enormous , " said gerd herx , director of the german office for foreign trade .
" we have deliveries to kazakhstan with a trade volume of about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- . "
herx said he sees strong chances for european enterprisers in uzbekistan as well . while trade improves between the eu and central asia , many european entrepreneurs are hesitant about investing directly in the region , schmitz said , because of huge legal uncertainties . no direct pipelines to europe it 's likely to be even more difficult for the eu to push through its interests regarding energy policy .
europe wants to become more independent of russian gas and has had its eye on turkmenistan 's plentiful gas resources for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a transit country for gas deliveries to europe the problem is that until now turkmenistan 's gas exports have to flow through russia to reach europe - there are simply no other gas pipelines . europe wants to support the construction of new pipelines that circumvent russia , but schmitz questioned the viability the proposal . " it remains to be seen whether turkmenistan will ever be able to transport gas directly to europe , " she said . what 's more , turkmenistan is still focusing more strongly on russia than on the eu , said oezdemir , who expressed doubts that europe could do much to change that . " as long as the eu does n't have a common energy policy itself , we wo n't have a chance to compete with russia as far as central asia and the energy corridor go , " he said . manfred goetzke -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with its focus on human rights , the eu is likely to have a tougher time wooing the region 's nations than russia and china . the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on wednesday , april 9 , in the turkmen capital ashgabat is well overdue .
china , russia and other former soviet states already staked their claim there long ago . china has negotiated a gas pipeline project with turkmenistan that , starting in 2009 , is to deliver 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually to the people 's republic .
india and iran have also discovered the " stans " in central asia as both suppliers of energy and a profitable new market . over a year ago , the eu joined in the race for energy reserves and market potential in central asia .
in june 2007 , the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia in an effort to strengthen ties with turkmenistan , uzbekistan and the neighboring countries . more than just political good intentions are at stake : turkmenistan is one of the world 's most important gas suppliers and kazakhstan has one of the 10 largest oil and gas reserves . bildunterschrift : the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia last summer eu ca n't afford to compromise on rights issues the focus of wednesday 's meeting between the eu ministers and their central asian counterparts , led by slovenian head diplomat dimitrij rupel , is to determine what shape a partnership should take . one thing is already clear : the negotiations wo n't be easy .
while countries like russia and china are exclusively concerned with business matters , the europeans want to help improve the human rights situation in the region , said cem oezdemir , the european parliament 's rapporteur on central asia . " we have to make it clear that we ca n't allow ourselves to become dependent at any price and throw our standards overboard , " said oezdemir , a european parliamentarian for the green party . if the eu were to avoid taking a clear stance against human rights abuses in countries like uzbekistan and kazakhstan , it would jeopardize its own credibility , he added , since restricting press freedom , getting rid of the opposition and holding bogus elections run contrary to what europe stands for . " we have to have the courage to address -lsb- human rights violations -rsb- , even if the other competitors are n't interested in that . " appeals for improvement are n't likely to go over well with the new strategic partners in central asia . trade and values do n't go hand in hand as part of the soviet union , the region was subject to moscow 's rule for decades , and political advice can easily be taken as indoctrination , said andrea schmitz from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would lose its credibility if it did n't stand up for rights " a transfer of values would mean that the values would have to materialize in the form of institutions that represent them , but the elites in these countries simply seem to be lacking the political will , " said schmitz . despite the problems , there is interest among central asian nations to cooperate more closely with europe and seek new trade partners and european investors , in part to minimize their reliance on china and russia , schmitz said . " because of russia 's and china 's dominance and the resources they use to exercise power in central asia , the countries want to establish counterweights . " some central asian countries have already succeeded in doing just that . kazakhstan for instance has already attracted numerous german mid-sized companies . " growth rates are enormous , " said gerd herx , director of the german office for foreign trade .
" we have deliveries to kazakhstan with a trade volume of about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- . "
herx said he sees strong chances for european enterprisers in uzbekistan as well . while trade improves between the eu and central asia , many european entrepreneurs are hesitant about investing directly in the region , schmitz said , because of huge legal uncertainties . no direct pipelines to europe it 's likely to be even more difficult for the eu to push through its interests regarding energy policy .
europe wants to become more independent of russian gas and has had its eye on turkmenistan 's plentiful gas resources for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a transit country for gas deliveries to europe the problem is that until now turkmenistan 's gas exports have to flow through russia to reach europe - there are simply no other gas pipelines . europe wants to support the construction of new pipelines that circumvent russia , but schmitz questioned the viability the proposal . " it remains to be seen whether turkmenistan will ever be able to transport gas directly to europe , " she said . what 's more , turkmenistan is still focusing more strongly on russia than on the eu , said oezdemir , who expressed doubts that europe could do much to change that .

it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .
rising energy prices are another hot german issue at present .
incumbent companies currently have " considerable scope to make market entry for their competitors cumbersome and costly , " the oecd noted . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus ceo tom enders rejected the allegations on wed , april 9 . enders stated that he and other officials were innocent of insider trading and called a report by french web news service mediapart which detailed the allegations incompetent , biased and unfair .
news of the probe into possible insider trading was leaked to the internet site which then published the allegations on tuesday , an act that enders called " shocking " and " unacceptable . "
" i know i have done nothing wrong nd i say the same for all the managers who are supposedly involved , " the airbus ceo told a news briefing in new zealand .
" i am absolutely convinced there was no wrong-doing .
we will demonstrate that the people who have done the investigation have n't done that in a competent way , " he said .
" we will defend our reputation and our rights to be presumed innocent with all means at our disposal , " he said .
" our names are dragged into the mud ... and we are sitting ducks .
so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .
airbus ceo calls french probe " biased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders believes the probe is driven by a conspiracy theory enders not only heavily criticized the online article but also the amf investigation itself , calling it " unfair " and " biased . "
" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "
the amf had previously announced that there was cause for action against several people at eads over alleged insider trading at the end of 2005 and in early 2006 , but did not release any names .
probe claims shares sold before delay made public the double-decker a380 is the largest passenger airline ever built , and has been the centerpiece of airbus efforts to compete with us rival boeing .
it made its first commercial flight in october after billions of dollars in cost over-runs and months of delays .

the a380 delays were publicly announced in june 2006 , sending the eads share price down more than 26 percent .
the amf said shortly after that it was looking at certain previous stock deals , and in july 2006 , forgeard stepped down .

airbus ceo tom enders rejected the allegations on wed , april 9 . enders stated that he and other officials were innocent of insider trading and called a report by french web news service mediapart which detailed the allegations incompetent , biased and unfair .
news of the probe into possible insider trading was leaked to the internet site which then published the allegations on tuesday , an act that enders called " shocking " and " unacceptable . "
" i know i have done nothing wrong nd i say the same for all the managers who are supposedly involved , " the airbus ceo told a news briefing in new zealand .
" i am absolutely convinced there was no wrong-doing .
we will demonstrate that the people who have done the investigation have n't done that in a competent way , " he said .
" we will defend our reputation and our rights to be presumed innocent with all means at our disposal , " he said .
" our names are dragged into the mud ... and we are sitting ducks .
so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .
airbus ceo calls french probe " biased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders believes the probe is driven by a conspiracy theory enders not only heavily criticized the online article but also the amf investigation itself , calling it " unfair " and " biased . "
" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "
the amf had previously announced that there was cause for action against several people at eads over alleged insider trading at the end of 2005 and in early 2006 , but did not release any names .
probe claims shares sold before delay made public the double-decker a380 is the largest passenger airline ever built , and has been the centerpiece of airbus efforts to compete with us rival boeing .
it made its first commercial flight in october after billions of dollars in cost over-runs and months of delays .

the a380 delays were publicly announced in june 2006 , sending the eads share price down more than 26 percent .

it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .
rising energy prices are another hot german issue at present .
incumbent companies currently have " considerable scope to make market entry for their competitors cumbersome and costly , " the oecd noted . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .
rising energy prices are another hot german issue at present .
incumbent companies currently have " considerable scope to make market entry for their competitors cumbersome and costly , " the oecd noted . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 09.04.2008 oecd study urges germany to pursue reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy is expected to grow despite fears of a global recession the organization for economic cooperation and development says the german economic upswing is set to continue but warned berlin it had to undertake reforms in every sector , in particular education , to maintain its edge . germany had enjoyed a strong cyclical rebound after a long period of stagnation , the oecd said , adding that solid foundations had been laid for sustaining the upswing or at least mitigating the effects of financial market turmoil .
it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .
rising energy prices are another hot german issue at present .
incumbent companies currently have " considerable scope to make market entry for their competitors cumbersome and costly , " the oecd noted . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .

airbus ceo tom enders rejected the allegations on wed , april 9 . enders stated that he and other officials were innocent of insider trading and called a report by french web news service mediapart which detailed the allegations incompetent , biased and unfair .
news of the probe into possible insider trading was leaked to the internet site which then published the allegations on tuesday , an act that enders called " shocking " and " unacceptable . "
" i know i have done nothing wrong nd i say the same for all the managers who are supposedly involved , " the airbus ceo told a news briefing in new zealand .
" i am absolutely convinced there was no wrong-doing .
we will demonstrate that the people who have done the investigation have n't done that in a competent way , " he said .
" we will defend our reputation and our rights to be presumed innocent with all means at our disposal , " he said .
" our names are dragged into the mud ... and we are sitting ducks .
so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .
airbus ceo calls french probe " biased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders believes the probe is driven by a conspiracy theory enders not only heavily criticized the online article but also the amf investigation itself , calling it " unfair " and " biased . "
" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "
the amf had previously announced that there was cause for action against several people at eads over alleged insider trading at the end of 2005 and in early 2006 , but did not release any names .
probe claims shares sold before delay made public the double-decker a380 is the largest passenger airline ever built , and has been the centerpiece of airbus efforts to compete with us rival boeing .
it made its first commercial flight in october after billions of dollars in cost over-runs and months of delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 delays were known three months before going public in march 2006 , eads privately cut its 2007 delivery target for the new superjumbo aircraft .
later that month , lagardere and what was then daimlerchrysler said they would each sell a 7.5 percent stake in eads .
the a380 delays were publicly announced in june 2006 , sending the eads share price down more than 26 percent .
the amf said shortly after that it was looking at certain previous stock deals , and in july 2006 , forgeard stepped down .
he has denied any wrongdoing .
the french government , which has a 15 percent stake in eads , has insisted its conduct in the matter has been " beyond reproach . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are around 180,000 christian refugees in iraq 's neighboring countries - that is syria , jordan and also turkey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 09.04.2008 oecd study urges germany to pursue reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy is expected to grow despite fears of a global recession the organization for economic cooperation and development says the german economic upswing is set to continue but warned berlin it had to undertake reforms in every sector , in particular education , to maintain its edge . germany had enjoyed a strong cyclical rebound after a long period of stagnation , the oecd said , adding that solid foundations had been laid for sustaining the upswing or at least mitigating the effects of financial market turmoil .
it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .
rising energy prices are another hot german issue at present .
incumbent companies currently have " considerable scope to make market entry for their competitors cumbersome and costly , " the oecd noted . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .

it called , nevertheless , for further reforms to raise output , noting that a " good start in this regard has been made with the labor market reforms of recent years . "
the oecd put growth this year at 1.8 percent , adjusted for working days , with 1.6 percent in 2009 .
economic growth last year came in at 2.9 percent .
however , the oecd expected growth in europe 's biggest economy to slow sharply " from 2.5 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2009 , " shaving downwards estimates released in december of 2.6 percent for 2007 and 1.6 percent for 2009 .
the oecd based its forecast on the assumption that inflation would not continue to rise .
german annual consumer inflation came in at the comparatively high level of 3.1 percent in march .
the study noted that exports have boomed thanks to german expertise in capital and intermediate goods used to make other products that are currently in demand and which have not been seriously affected by the rise of the euro .
but to raise the country 's growth potential further , germans needed to put in more hours on the job , and sectors such as energy and transportation had to be opened up to greater competition , the survey said .
the oecd said that social and tax policies should also be changed to encourage germans to work and study longer .
incentives needed to encourage more work and study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax reforms could persuade germans to study for longer the oecd said the german workforce could be employed to greater effect with longer hours and increased efficiency and to achieve this , policies should be adapted .
changes should include a reduction of tax disincentives , improved access to childcare for working mothers , and increased competition in the energy and transport sectors , it added .
" among oecd countries , german stands out as having a very low number of hours worked , " with only norway and the netherlands showing a lower rate , the 30-member organization noted .
meanwhile , " improving education outcomes , including by reducing the impact of socio-economic background , " was crucial to sustaining german growth and social cohesion , it added .
the organization found that in germany , women , especially those who were married , worked less than the oecd average .
it also said that the " effective tax burden " which included taxes , social charges and withdrawal of cash benefits on second earners in germany " is particularly high . "
mothers and part-time employees should contribute more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more child care places would allow mothers to go back to work a lack of childcare facilities was a key reason for low work input by mothers it said , noting that the government planned to increase the number of daycare places significantly by 2013 .
in general , germany had a high percentage of part-time employees , who " work fewer hours than in any other oecd country , " the survey found .
in addition , the 30-member oecd stressed that improving education " would enhance productivity and employment prospects and , if distributed more evenly , reduce income inequality .
" the main problem to overcome in student achievement is that socio-economic and / or immigrant backgrounds have a large impact on outcomes , " the report said .
higher education was below average in general among those aged between 25 and 34 , it said .
the review suggested efforts be made to raise attendance by children from disadvantaged backgrounds " in kindergarten from three years of age onwards , " to level the education playing field later in life .
education institutions should be more accountable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers should be held responsible for pupils ' progress schools and teachers should also be held " more accountable for the progress of all students and to provide individualized support to weaker students to bring them up to the required level quickly , as occurs in finland , " it added .
with regard to a german debate over expanding minimum wage agreements , the survey recommended that independent experts consider the matter to avoid politicizing the issue , and to lessen " the risk of the minimum wage being set at a level that harms employment . "
in other comments , the oecd proposed that germany strengthen competition in network industries such as energy and railways .
that would boost productivity because those sectors " produce important services for other parts of the economy , " it said .
rising energy prices are another hot german issue at present .
incumbent companies currently have " considerable scope to make market entry for their competitors cumbersome and costly , " the oecd noted . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with its focus on human rights , the eu is likely to have a tougher time wooing the region 's nations than russia and china . the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on wednesday , april 9 , in the turkmen capital ashgabat is well overdue .
china , russia and other former soviet states already staked their claim there long ago . china has negotiated a gas pipeline project with turkmenistan that , starting in 2009 , is to deliver 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually to the people 's republic .
india and iran have also discovered the " stans " in central asia as both suppliers of energy and a profitable new market . over a year ago , the eu joined in the race for energy reserves and market potential in central asia .
in june 2007 , the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia in an effort to strengthen ties with turkmenistan , uzbekistan and the neighboring countries . more than just political good intentions are at stake : turkmenistan is one of the world 's most important gas suppliers and kazakhstan has one of the 10 largest oil and gas reserves . bildunterschrift : the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia last summer eu ca n't afford to compromise on rights issues the focus of wednesday 's meeting between the eu ministers and their central asian counterparts , led by slovenian head diplomat dimitrij rupel , is to determine what shape a partnership should take . one thing is already clear : the negotiations wo n't be easy .
while countries like russia and china are exclusively concerned with business matters , the europeans want to help improve the human rights situation in the region , said cem oezdemir , the european parliament 's rapporteur on central asia . " we have to make it clear that we ca n't allow ourselves to become dependent at any price and throw our standards overboard , " said oezdemir , a european parliamentarian for the green party . if the eu were to avoid taking a clear stance against human rights abuses in countries like uzbekistan and kazakhstan , it would jeopardize its own credibility , he added , since restricting press freedom , getting rid of the opposition and holding bogus elections run contrary to what europe stands for .

" because of russia 's and china 's dominance and the resources they use to exercise power in central asia , the countries want to establish counterweights . " some central asian countries have already succeeded in doing just that . kazakhstan for instance has already attracted numerous german mid-sized companies .

but with its focus on human rights , the eu is likely to have a tougher time wooing the region 's nations than russia and china . the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on wednesday , april 9 , in the turkmen capital ashgabat is well overdue .
china , russia and other former soviet states already staked their claim there long ago . china has negotiated a gas pipeline project with turkmenistan that , starting in 2009 , is to deliver 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually to the people 's republic .
india and iran have also discovered the " stans " in central asia as both suppliers of energy and a profitable new market . over a year ago , the eu joined in the race for energy reserves and market potential in central asia .
in june 2007 , the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia in an effort to strengthen ties with turkmenistan , uzbekistan and the neighboring countries . more than just political good intentions are at stake : turkmenistan is one of the world 's most important gas suppliers and kazakhstan has one of the 10 largest oil and gas reserves . bildunterschrift : the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia last summer eu ca n't afford to compromise on rights issues the focus of wednesday 's meeting between the eu ministers and their central asian counterparts , led by slovenian head diplomat dimitrij rupel , is to determine what shape a partnership should take . one thing is already clear : the negotiations wo n't be easy .
while countries like russia and china are exclusively concerned with business matters , the europeans want to help improve the human rights situation in the region , said cem oezdemir , the european parliament 's rapporteur on central asia . " we have to make it clear that we ca n't allow ourselves to become dependent at any price and throw our standards overboard , " said oezdemir , a european parliamentarian for the green party . if the eu were to avoid taking a clear stance against human rights abuses in countries like uzbekistan and kazakhstan , it would jeopardize its own credibility , he added , since restricting press freedom , getting rid of the opposition and holding bogus elections run contrary to what europe stands for .

" we have deliveries to kazakhstan with a trade volume of about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- . "
herx said he sees strong chances for european enterprisers in uzbekistan as well . while trade improves between the eu and central asia , many european entrepreneurs are hesitant about investing directly in the region , schmitz said , because of huge legal uncertainties . no direct pipelines to europe it 's likely to be even more difficult for the eu to push through its interests regarding energy policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.04.2008 eu walks fine line on trade and human rights in central asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to lower its reliance on russian oil and explore new energy sources europe has belatedly discovered central asia as an energy supplier .
but with its focus on human rights , the eu is likely to have a tougher time wooing the region 's nations than russia and china . the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on wednesday , april 9 , in the turkmen capital ashgabat is well overdue .
china , russia and other former soviet states already staked their claim there long ago . china has negotiated a gas pipeline project with turkmenistan that , starting in 2009 , is to deliver 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually to the people 's republic .
india and iran have also discovered the " stans " in central asia as both suppliers of energy and a profitable new market . over a year ago , the eu joined in the race for energy reserves and market potential in central asia .
in june 2007 , the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia in an effort to strengthen ties with turkmenistan , uzbekistan and the neighboring countries . more than just political good intentions are at stake : turkmenistan is one of the world 's most important gas suppliers and kazakhstan has one of the 10 largest oil and gas reserves . bildunterschrift : the council of europe adopted the strategy for a new partnership with central asia last summer eu ca n't afford to compromise on rights issues the focus of wednesday 's meeting between the eu ministers and their central asian counterparts , led by slovenian head diplomat dimitrij rupel , is to determine what shape a partnership should take . one thing is already clear : the negotiations wo n't be easy .
while countries like russia and china are exclusively concerned with business matters , the europeans want to help improve the human rights situation in the region , said cem oezdemir , the european parliament 's rapporteur on central asia . " we have to make it clear that we ca n't allow ourselves to become dependent at any price and throw our standards overboard , " said oezdemir , a european parliamentarian for the green party . if the eu were to avoid taking a clear stance against human rights abuses in countries like uzbekistan and kazakhstan , it would jeopardize its own credibility , he added , since restricting press freedom , getting rid of the opposition and holding bogus elections run contrary to what europe stands for . " we have to have the courage to address -lsb- human rights violations -rsb- , even if the other competitors are n't interested in that . " appeals for improvement are n't likely to go over well with the new strategic partners in central asia . trade and values do n't go hand in hand as part of the soviet union , the region was subject to moscow 's rule for decades , and political advice can easily be taken as indoctrination , said andrea schmitz from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would lose its credibility if it did n't stand up for rights " a transfer of values would mean that the values would have to materialize in the form of institutions that represent them , but the elites in these countries simply seem to be lacking the political will , " said schmitz . despite the problems , there is interest among central asian nations to cooperate more closely with europe and seek new trade partners and european investors , in part to minimize their reliance on china and russia , schmitz said . " because of russia 's and china 's dominance and the resources they use to exercise power in central asia , the countries want to establish counterweights . " some central asian countries have already succeeded in doing just that . kazakhstan for instance has already attracted numerous german mid-sized companies . " growth rates are enormous , " said gerd herx , director of the german office for foreign trade .
" we have deliveries to kazakhstan with a trade volume of about 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- . "
herx said he sees strong chances for european enterprisers in uzbekistan as well . while trade improves between the eu and central asia , many european entrepreneurs are hesitant about investing directly in the region , schmitz said , because of huge legal uncertainties . no direct pipelines to europe it 's likely to be even more difficult for the eu to push through its interests regarding energy policy .

“ the propaganda show that the chinese have planned -lrb- with their relay race -rrb- is turning into a race through a gauntlet , ” thilo hoppe , the head of the bundestag 's committee on economic cooperation and development , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic torch run has met with protests in paris ...
hoppe and other representatives from the parliamentary committee spent nine days in nepal on a fact-finding mission ahead of a general election . because of the ongoing demonstrations of exiled tibetans in nepal , however , the lawmakers met with tibetan exiles living in the nepalese capital katmandu , in particular the representative of the dalai lama .
tibet 's demand for cultural autonomy hoppe said the exiles were demanding more cultural autonomy for tibet , rather than complete independence from china - a stance he finds " moderate . "
“ i support a nonviolent movement for more autonomy within china , ” hoppe said .
he warned that china " should make use of the dalai lama 's modest position ...

this had even cost lives .
" no one can get any wares in or out - the monasteries are surrounded , " the lawmaker said .
" this has been the cause of at least one , possibly two , deaths . "
when the delegation tried to talk to the nepali regime about the rights of the tibetan exiles to hold demonstrations in nepal , they were met with shrugs by a representative of the nepali government . " the chinese ambassador to nepal had demanded the government to forbid so-called anti-chinese manifestations , " hoppe said .
" when we pointed out that there are international accords granting this right , he simply said , ' that may be so , but china is big and nepal is small ' . " peaceful demonstrations ?
in addition , the tibetan exiles that met with the german delegation insisited that protests against chinese rule had been overwhelmingly peaceful .
but some violent protests had been staged by chinese security forces , who had dressed up in monks ' robes .
those protests - showing monks setting fire to automobiles and breaking windows - were shown on chinese state television , to show the dalai lama and his adherents in a violent light , they said .
the exiled tibetans showed the parliamentarians photographs of chinese soldiers carrying monks ' robes in their luggage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aerospace -pipe- 09.04.2008 airbus ceo reacts angrily to accusations of insider trading großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top managers are said to have sold off shares before the a380 was plagued by delays a group of 17 top managers at european aerospace and defense group eads and its airbus unit may have sold shares with insider knowledge , a report has said .
airbus ceo tom enders rejected the allegations on wed , april 9 . enders stated that he and other officials were innocent of insider trading and called a report by french web news service mediapart which detailed the allegations incompetent , biased and unfair .
news of the probe into possible insider trading was leaked to the internet site which then published the allegations on tuesday , an act that enders called " shocking " and " unacceptable . "
" i know i have done nothing wrong nd i say the same for all the managers who are supposedly involved , " the airbus ceo told a news briefing in new zealand .
" i am absolutely convinced there was no wrong-doing .
we will demonstrate that the people who have done the investigation have n't done that in a competent way , " he said .
" we will defend our reputation and our rights to be presumed innocent with all means at our disposal , " he said .
" our names are dragged into the mud ... and we are sitting ducks .
so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .
airbus ceo calls french probe " biased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders believes the probe is driven by a conspiracy theory enders not only heavily criticized the online article but also the amf investigation itself , calling it " unfair " and " biased . "
" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "
the amf had previously announced that there was cause for action against several people at eads over alleged insider trading at the end of 2005 and in early 2006 , but did not release any names .
probe claims shares sold before delay made public the double-decker a380 is the largest passenger airline ever built , and has been the centerpiece of airbus efforts to compete with us rival boeing .
it made its first commercial flight in october after billions of dollars in cost over-runs and months of delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 delays were known three months before going public in march 2006 , eads privately cut its 2007 delivery target for the new superjumbo aircraft .
later that month , lagardere and what was then daimlerchrysler said they would each sell a 7.5 percent stake in eads .
the a380 delays were publicly announced in june 2006 , sending the eads share price down more than 26 percent .
the amf said shortly after that it was looking at certain previous stock deals , and in july 2006 , forgeard stepped down .
he has denied any wrongdoing .
the french government , which has a 15 percent stake in eads , has insisted its conduct in the matter has been " beyond reproach . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus ceo tom enders rejected the allegations on wed , april 9 . enders stated that he and other officials were innocent of insider trading and called a report by french web news service mediapart which detailed the allegations incompetent , biased and unfair .
news of the probe into possible insider trading was leaked to the internet site which then published the allegations on tuesday , an act that enders called " shocking " and " unacceptable . "
" i know i have done nothing wrong nd i say the same for all the managers who are supposedly involved , " the airbus ceo told a news briefing in new zealand .
" i am absolutely convinced there was no wrong-doing .
we will demonstrate that the people who have done the investigation have n't done that in a competent way , " he said .
" we will defend our reputation and our rights to be presumed innocent with all means at our disposal , " he said .
" our names are dragged into the mud ... and we are sitting ducks .
so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .
airbus ceo calls french probe " biased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders believes the probe is driven by a conspiracy theory enders not only heavily criticized the online article but also the amf investigation itself , calling it " unfair " and " biased . "
" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "
the amf had previously announced that there was cause for action against several people at eads over alleged insider trading at the end of 2005 and in early 2006 , but did not release any names .
probe claims shares sold before delay made public the double-decker a380 is the largest passenger airline ever built , and has been the centerpiece of airbus efforts to compete with us rival boeing .
it made its first commercial flight in october after billions of dollars in cost over-runs and months of delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 delays were known three months before going public in march 2006 , eads privately cut its 2007 delivery target for the new superjumbo aircraft .
later that month , lagardere and what was then daimlerchrysler said they would each sell a 7.5 percent stake in eads .
the a380 delays were publicly announced in june 2006 , sending the eads share price down more than 26 percent .
the amf said shortly after that it was looking at certain previous stock deals , and in july 2006 , forgeard stepped down .

so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .
airbus ceo calls french probe " biased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders believes the probe is driven by a conspiracy theory enders not only heavily criticized the online article but also the amf investigation itself , calling it " unfair " and " biased . "
" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "
the amf had previously announced that there was cause for action against several people at eads over alleged insider trading at the end of 2005 and in early 2006 , but did not release any names .
probe claims shares sold before delay made public the double-decker a380 is the largest passenger airline ever built , and has been the centerpiece of airbus efforts to compete with us rival boeing .
it made its first commercial flight in october after billions of dollars in cost over-runs and months of delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 delays were known three months before going public in march 2006 , eads privately cut its 2007 delivery target for the new superjumbo aircraft .
later that month , lagardere and what was then daimlerchrysler said they would each sell a 7.5 percent stake in eads .
the a380 delays were publicly announced in june 2006 , sending the eads share price down more than 26 percent .
the amf said shortly after that it was looking at certain previous stock deals , and in july 2006 , forgeard stepped down .
he has denied any wrongdoing .
the french government , which has a 15 percent stake in eads , has insisted its conduct in the matter has been " beyond reproach . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus ceo tom enders rejected the allegations on wed , april 9 . enders stated that he and other officials were innocent of insider trading and called a report by french web news service mediapart which detailed the allegations incompetent , biased and unfair .
news of the probe into possible insider trading was leaked to the internet site which then published the allegations on tuesday , an act that enders called " shocking " and " unacceptable . "
" i know i have done nothing wrong nd i say the same for all the managers who are supposedly involved , " the airbus ceo told a news briefing in new zealand .
" i am absolutely convinced there was no wrong-doing .
we will demonstrate that the people who have done the investigation have n't done that in a competent way , " he said .
" we will defend our reputation and our rights to be presumed innocent with all means at our disposal , " he said .
" our names are dragged into the mud ... and we are sitting ducks .
so we hope very much that these accusations now come into the open , and then the managers know what they are accused of , so we can defend ourselves . "
the mediapart report , sourced to french investigators at the financial markets authority -lrb- amf -rrb- , claimed that french regulators were probing 17 officials at airbus and eads to see if they had sold off shares in light of inside information they had about production delays for the superjumbo .
mediapart said that among those being probed were enders and former eads co-chief executive noel forgeard - as well as shareholders including german automaker daimler and french media and defense firm lagardere .
the head of the amf criticized the leak , but refused to comment on the contents .
airbus ceo calls french probe " biased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders believes the probe is driven by a conspiracy theory enders not only heavily criticized the online article but also the amf investigation itself , calling it " unfair " and " biased . "
" the investigation has been conducted by people who know nothing about our business and do n't even want to know about our business , and are driven by a conspiracy theory , " he added .
" as the head of airbus and a member of the eads top team , i stand up to say i 'm absolutely convinced that we will refute all allegations .
we hope that soon we 'll be able to defend ourselves properly , because so far we have n't . "
the amf had previously announced that there was cause for action against several people at eads over alleged insider trading at the end of 2005 and in early 2006 , but did not release any names .
probe claims shares sold before delay made public the double-decker a380 is the largest passenger airline ever built , and has been the centerpiece of airbus efforts to compete with us rival boeing .
it made its first commercial flight in october after billions of dollars in cost over-runs and months of delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 delays were known three months before going public in march 2006 , eads privately cut its 2007 delivery target for the new superjumbo aircraft .
later that month , lagardere and what was then daimlerchrysler said they would each sell a 7.5 percent stake in eads .
the a380 delays were publicly announced in june 2006 , sending the eads share price down more than 26 percent .
the amf said shortly after that it was looking at certain previous stock deals , and in july 2006 , forgeard stepped down .
he has denied any wrongdoing .
the french government , which has a 15 percent stake in eads , has insisted its conduct in the matter has been " beyond reproach . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over 130 days , the torch will cross five continents and stop in 21 cities before reaching china .
it is meant to be carried by more than 21,000 people and to travel 137,000 kilometers -lrb- 85,000 miles -rrb- before it arrives in beijing on august 8 for the opening ceremony of the games . " the olympic flame will radiate light and happiness , peace and friendship , and hope and dreams to the people of china and the whole world , " said president of the beijing olympic committee president lieu qi , at the torch-lighting ceremony in greece .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flame was lit in a ceremony in greece while that sounds eminently noble and true to the olympic ideal , the tradition has much more dubious origins at the 1936 berlin games .
carl diem , a functionary in hitler 's nazi sporting apparatus , is widely considered the creator of the torch relay .
diem supposedly was inspired by drawings of torchbearers on an antique vase , but joseph goebbels ' propaganda ministry had a strong role in supporting the project . from olympia , the torch was carried through the greek cities of athens , delphi and thessaloniki .
then it traveled to sofia , belgrade , budapest , vienna , prague and dresden before making its way to berlin .
siegfried eifrig , now 94 , carried the flame on august 1 , 1936 into the heart of the nazi 's capital . " i carried the torch down unter den linden past the statue of frederick the great .
there was a big youth event with around 30,000 young people near the old museum .
i ran past the youths and up to an altar as tall as a man .
that 's where i lit the flame . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi sportjugend -lrb- sport youth -rrb- in 1938 in nuremberg the gathering of young people was organized under the auspices of the hitler youth and goebbels closed the event with the words : " holy flame glow , glow and never be extinguished ! " although the flame was supposed to symbolize world peace during the olympic games , hitler 's germany was backing general francisco franco in the spanish civil war .
experience gathered there by the nazis would later be put to use during the second world war . the torch relay has since shaken off its darker past to become an integral feature of every olympics .
however , torchbearer eifrig , never a member of any nazi organization , pointed out that the world still has n't managed to live up to its peaceful ideal .

school places have not been found for 236 children in hackney this september .
parents have told hackney council that they would like them to go to bridge academy , which has spare classrooms as it has only operated for one year .
the learning trust , which runs hackney education , said it was discussing the plan with central government .
last month children nationwide were offered places at secondary schools after choosing up to six preferred schools .

representing 14.4 % of the total number of applicants in hackney , it was the borough with the highest percentage of children without a school in england .
' turned schools around ' since then places have been found for a further 95 children in the borough and the learning trust said it was confident that by september the majority of parents would have found schools .
a learning trust spokeswoman said : " back in 2001 there were fewer places available in hackney and they were not being accepted by parents .
" what has happened is that we have turned around the schools in hackney so there has been an increase in parents wanting to send their children here , from both inside and outside the borough . "

it has taken one extra intake of students per year , so its classrooms will not be full until 2011 .
parents also want a new kpmg academy school , due to open in hackney in 2009 , to open a year early to ease the situation .
" new academy school facilities , which have cost millions , are left unused as the schools are filled from the ' bottom up , " ' he said .

alan esslemont , the new head of content at the gaelic media service which would run gds , said young audiences want comedy and entertainment .
he warned there was not funding available to commission a " mega hit " such as father ted or friends .
however , he said a drama could eventually be screened on the service .
in the latest gms newsletter , he said : " comedy is n't an easy genre , in gaelic or in english , and it 's been a long while since there was a ' mega hit ' like friends or father ted on the small screen .
" for a station like this to be successful , it needs a soap or long running series .
" we have n't the budget right now to made a long drama series , but we have to start thinking about drama development and about possible sources of funding for this genre . "
he added : " it wo n't happen overnight , but i 'm certain it 's something we can achieve . "
camera work meanwhile , a new television training facility is to open soon in preparation for the launch of gds .
gms will run it in partnership with college sabhal mor ostaig on skye .
the centre will be used for training in camera work , lighting , sound , writing and editing .
the bbc trust gave its go-ahead in january for bbc scotland and gms to launch the new service , which includes television , radio and online services .
the trust said its approval was subject to certain conditions - including that it initially launches on cable , satellite and broadband .
a review of the service will be carried out before it is considered for broadcast on freeview .
the trust said it expected the gds to launch early in the summer .

researchers said men generally preferred women they perceive are open to short-term sexual relationships , with women after longer-term matches .
men with big jaws and small eyes were perceived as less committed by women .
the universities of aberdeen and st andrews worked with durham university studying 700 people in their 20s .
the scientists said their research showed people could use their perceptions to make more informed partner selection depending on the type of relationship they were after . "
this really is the first study to show that people are also sensitive to subtle facial signals about the type of romantic relationships that others might enjoy " dr ben jones university of aberdeen 's face research lab heterosexual participants were shown pairs of photographs of men and women in their early 20s .
participants were asked to choose the face that they felt would be more open to short-term sexual relationships , one-night stands and the idea of sex without love .
they were also asked which face they thought was the most attractive for a long or short-term relationship , who was more masculine or feminine , and who they thought was generally attractive .
' instinctive judgements ' these judgments were compared with the actual attitudes to relationships of the subjects in the photographs determined through a questionnaire .
researchers said that the results determined many could accurately judge from photographs who would be more interested in a short-term sexual relationship or a long-term relationship .
women who were open to short-term sexual relationships were usually seen by others as more attractive .
the men who were more open to casual sex were generally perceived as more masculine-looking , with squarer jaws , larger noses and smaller eyes .
dr lynda boothroyd , of durham university 's psychology department , told the bbc scotland news website : " this study shows we can make these kind of instinctive judgements for sex .
we have a subconscious - not always right but reasonable - guide . "
she explained : " our results suggest that although some people can judge the sexual strategy of others simply from looking at their face , people are not always sure about their judgements possibly because the cues are very subtle .
" yet preferences for different types of face were actually quite strong .
this shows that these initial impressions may be part of how we assess potential mates - or potential rivals - when we first meet them .
" these will then give way over time to more in depth knowledge of that person , as you get to know them better , and may change with age . "
' not presume ' dr ben jones , of the university of aberdeen 's face research lab , said : " lots of previous studies have shown that people can judge a lot about a person from their face , including things like health and even some personality traits like introversion .
" but this really is the first study to show that people are also sensitive to subtle facial signals about the type of romantic relationships that others might enjoy . "
professor david perrett , a psychologist from the perception lab at the university of st andrews , added : " while faces do hold cues to sexual attitudes , men should not presume any kind of relationship is wanted from appearance alone since women 's choice is what matters .
" indeed most women found promiscuous-looking guys unattractive for both short and long-term relationships . "
the study , published in the journal of evolution and human behaviour on wednesday , was funded by the medical research council and the economic and social research council .

researchers said men generally preferred women they perceive are open to short-term sexual relationships , with women after longer-term matches .
men with big jaws and small eyes were perceived as less committed by women .
the universities of aberdeen and st andrews worked with durham university studying 700 people in their 20s .
the scientists said their research showed people could use their perceptions to make more informed partner selection depending on the type of relationship they were after .
this really is the first study to show that people are also sensitive to subtle facial signals about the type of romantic relationships that others might enjoy dr ben jones university of aberdeen 's face research lab heterosexual participants were shown pairs of photographs of men and women in their early 20s .
participants were asked to choose the face that they felt would be more open to short-term sexual relationships , one-night stands and the idea of sex without love .
they were also asked which face they thought was the most attractive for a long or short-term relationship , who was more masculine or feminine , and who they thought was generally attractive .
' instinctive judgements ' these judgments were compared with the actual attitudes to relationships of the subjects in the photographs determined through a questionnaire .
researchers said that the results determined many could accurately judge from photographs who would be more interested in a short-term sexual relationship or a long-term relationship .
women who were open to short-term sexual relationships were usually seen by others as more attractive .
the left face is said to be generally keener on long-term relationships the men who were more open to casual sex were generally perceived as more masculine-looking , with squarer jaws , larger noses and smaller eyes .
dr lynda boothroyd , of durham university 's psychology department , told the bbc scotland news website : " this study shows we can make these kind of instinctive judgements for sex .
we have a subconscious - not always right but reasonable - guide . "
she explained : " our results suggest that although some people can judge the sexual strategy of others simply from looking at their face , people are not always sure about their judgements possibly because the cues are very subtle .
" yet preferences for different types of face were actually quite strong .
this shows that these initial impressions may be part of how we assess potential mates - or potential rivals - when we first meet them .
" these will then give way over time to more in depth knowledge of that person , as you get to know them better , and may change with age . "
' not presume ' dr ben jones , of the university of aberdeen 's face research lab , said : " lots of previous studies have shown that people can judge a lot about a person from their face , including things like health and even some personality traits like introversion .
" but this really is the first study to show that people are also sensitive to subtle facial signals about the type of romantic relationships that others might enjoy . "
professor david perrett , a psychologist from the perception lab at the university of st andrews , added : " while faces do hold cues to sexual attitudes , men should not presume any kind of relationship is wanted from appearance alone since women 's choice is what matters .

police in hanoi arrested four suspects in february while they were trying to take two babies out of the country .
since then , the authorities have detained three more and the hunt for others connected to the gang continues .
among those detained was an eight-month pregnant woman who had agreed to sell her unborn baby .
detectives in the hoan kiem district of hanoi said in a six-month period from july 2007 to february 2008 , the ring had smuggled up to 30 babies , mostly newborn , to china .
but the total of smuggled children might be much higher as the gang had been active before that , officials said .
the district police said the scale of the ring 's activities was so large that they had to transfer the case to central police to follow up .
it is believed that the smugglers had been scouring for babies and pregnant women from poor families in rural areas across the country .
they paid between 7m dong -lrb- $ 440 ; £ 220 -rrb- and 20m dong for each baby - boys usually costing more than girls .
the babies were then transferred to quang ninh province on china border and offered for adoption .

police in hanoi arrested four suspects in february while they were trying to take two babies out of the country .
since then , the authorities have detained three more and the hunt for others connected to the gang continues .
among those detained was an eight-month pregnant woman who had agreed to sell her unborn baby .
detectives in the hoan kiem district of hanoi said in a six-month period from july 2007 to february 2008 , the ring had smuggled up to 30 babies , mostly newborn , to china .
but the total of smuggled children might be much higher as the gang had been active before that , officials said .
the district police said the scale of the ring 's activities was so large that they had to transfer the case to central police to follow up .
it is believed that the smugglers had been scouring for babies and pregnant women from poor families in rural areas across the country .
they paid between 7m dong -lrb- $ 440 ; £ 220 -rrb- and 20m dong for each baby - boys usually costing more than girls .
the babies were then transferred to quang ninh province on china border and offered for adoption .

the carrier has been referred by the advertising standards authority -lrb- asa -rrb- which has found ryanair in breach of rules seven times in two years .
the asa said exaggerated claims about flight availability at advertised prices , and prices that omitted taxes and charges had misled consumers .
ryanair has already complained to the oft about the asa 's rulings .
' last straw ' the low-cost carrier said that the authority 's rulings against it had been " unfair , biased and untrue " . "
it is very disappointing , but absolutely necessary , that we have had to take this course of action " advertising standards authority the asa had " demonstrated a repeated lack of independence , impartiality and fairness " , ryanair added .
and it described the latest ruling - that it had made exaggerated claims about the availability of flights at advertised prices that did not include taxes and charges - as " the last straw " .
" it 's one of a number of advertisements where the asa has demonstrated unfair procedures and bias and a clear anti-ryanair agenda , " said the carrier 's spokesman peter sherrard .
" in this case , the complainant could n't remember and could n't provide any evidence of the flights he was trying to book .
" most sensible organisations or adjudicators at that stage would simply have dropped the complaint and let it lie . "
' very disappointing ' other adverts which the asa deemed to have broken rules included ryanair : claiming its flight from london to brussels was faster and cheaper than making the journey by eurostar playing down the impact of aviation on the environment suggesting that stating that people buying tickets via an online agent were being " ripped off " using a model in schoolgirl-style clothes and a headline " hottest back to school fares " and in a matter not dealt with by the asa , french president nicolas sarkozy and his wife carla bruni won a case against ryanair for using their picture without consent .
formal referrals to the oft were rare , said the asa 's director general christopher graham - the last occurring in 2005 " we would prefer to work with advertisers within the self-regulatory system rather than call in a statutory body , but ryanair 's approach has left us with no option , " he added .
" it is very disappointing , but absolutely necessary , that we have had to take this course of action .
mr graham added that ryanair had been given " every opportunity to put its house in order and ensure that its advertising adheres to the codes " .
" instead , they have continued to mislead consumers and denigrate competitors , " he said .
in february ryanair shut down its website - in part to comply with an order by uk market regulators to make prices on its website clearer to consumers .
last august , the oft ordered 13 airlines to amend their websites to include " fixed non-optional " costs in their headline fares .
