about two thirds of the initial test subjects participated in the second round of questioning . while less than 15 percent of non-smokers reported having suicidal thoughts , over 30 percent of addicts had considered committing suicide .
the rate for occasional smokers and non-addicted regular smokers was around 20 percent . more research needed none of the test subjects actually took their own life during the study , though almost 70 of them made suicide attempts . " campaigns for reducing smoking should also point to the elevated risk of suicidality for occasional and regular smokers , " wrote the study 's authors in the journal of affective disorders , as reported by dpa news agency . the scientists in charge of the study said that none of the participants had a history of clinical depression or of alcohol or drug abuse .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates has launched a diplomatic drive to persuade europeans to step up support " a few allies in nato should n't have the luxury to decide only for stabilization and civilian operations thereby forcing other allies to bear a disproportionate share of fighting and dying , " gates told a group of high-profile diplomats at a key security conference in the southern german city of munich on sunday , feb 10 .
the us has some 29,000 troops in afghanistan .
" we must not , we can not , become a two-tiered alliance of those who are willing to fight and those who are not , " gates said .
" such a development , with all its implications for collective security , would effectively destroy the alliance , " gates told delegates at the conference .
in recent weeks , gates has pressed berlin and other allies to provide more troops and resources for the nato force in afghanistan gates soothes tensions with germany the pressure has raised problems for the german government caught between maintaining good relations with washington and selling a risky military mission to increasingly sceptical voters at home .
germany , which has confined its 3,200 troops to the safer north of afghanistan where they are largely involved in civil reconstruction , has repeatedly ruled out sending combat troops to the south .
earlier , the pentagon chief attempted to calm tensions with germany , the third largest troop provider in afghanistan , over nato 's afghan mission , saying ties would not suffer if berlin did not provide fresh troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has warned that troops are overstretched in afghanistan " any additional numbers from any country are most appreciated , " gates told reporters at the conference . " maybe some will be able to help .
it certainly will not be seen as negative in our bilateral relations if some are not able to do more . "
some german politicians criticised gates after his speech , with one accusing him of public " finger pointing , " but the pentagon chief said he had not meant to single out specific countries and called germany " a little overly sensitive . "
" this is a problem that the alliance has , not that any individual country has , " gates said .
" the finger was never pointed in germany 's direction . "
germany defends afghan mission chancellor angela merkel defended germany 's engagement in a newspaper interview published on sunday , and confirmed the country would not alter its mission in afghanistan , despite a report in the weekly der spiegel on saturday that said germany was planning to expand the number of soldiers by 1,000 to 4,500 .
" we 've got a strong engagement with our responsibilities in the north , " she told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , adding " it 's not the case that ' nothing is going on there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel defended germany 's involvement in northern afghanistan " we approved a mandate in parliament just a few months ago for the operation and that remains valid until october .
nothing about that will be changed . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too urged the us to be fair in the row over german troops in afghanistan .
" i 'm not surprised that there are debates over individual contributions .
but they must be fair ones , " steinmeier told german news magazine focus .
gates : europe not aware of danger at the same time , gates said at the security conference that europeans seemed unconvinced by the involvement in afghanistan .
" many europeans question the worth of our actions and doubt whether the mission is worth the lives of their sons and daughters , " gates said .
" fragile coalition governments make it difficult to take on this risk . "
the pentagon chief said he was worried that many people in europe had not understood the magnitude of the direct threat to european security .
gates bemoaned the fact that many europeans were questioning the merits of nato 's role in afghanistan and were calling for their troops to be pulled out , arguing that there was a direct link between the fight against the taliban and the broader fight against islamic terrorism .
" with safe havens in the middle east , and new tactics honed on the battlefield and transmitted via the internet , violence and terrorism worldwide could surge , " he said .
the pentagon chief appealed this week to europeans not to let their opposition to the iraq war color their view of the conflict in afghanistan . " i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused and what i want to try and focus on is why afghanistan is important to europe , " gates said on friday .
" i think they -lsb- the europeans -rsb- combine the two , " gates continued .
" many of them , i think , have a problem with our involvement in iraq and project that to afghanistan and do not understand the very different - for them - the very different kind of threat . "
" soldier for soldier , euro for dollar " gates ' push for more european help in afghanistan was echoed by victoria nuland , the us ambassador to nato .
" we will be urgently requesting all our allies , including germany , at the nato summit in bucharest in april to match us soldier for soldier , euro for dollar , " nuland wrote in an article in german daily berliner zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from the afghan army and canadian troop patroling in kandahar nuland wrote that nato was confronted with the biggest challenge in its 59-year-old history .
" the mission in afghanistan is an investment in our common security and a catalyst for adapting our democratic alliance to the demands of the 21st century , " she wrote .
" if we are successful in the hindukush , we will be stronger the next time we are called upon to defend our security and values far away from home . "
pressure on europeans set to grow pressure on europeans from the us to shoulder more security burdens on the international stage is expected to grow regardless of whether the next us administration is republican or democratic , experts say .
" whoever wins the elections will have to reduce the financial and economic burdens that have resulted from the us ' foreign and security policy commitments , " said horst teltschik , the munich conference organizer this week .
" we will witness more debate on the future international role of nato and burden-sharing in general and on the responsibility shouldered by the europeans for resolving conflicts in particular . "
" a world in disarray " the annual roundtable in munich 's luxurious bayerischer hof hotel was attended by a handful of presidents , dozens of government ministers and hundreds of security experts from some 50 countries .
the conference 's theme - " a world in disarray - shifting powers lack of strategies " - saw delegates exchange views on a broad variety of issues , such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the widening rift between the west and vladimir putin 's russia .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates has launched a diplomatic drive to persuade europeans to step up support " a few allies in nato should n't have the luxury to decide only for stabilization and civilian operations thereby forcing other allies to bear a disproportionate share of fighting and dying , " gates told a group of high-profile diplomats at a key security conference in the southern german city of munich on sunday , feb 10 .
the us has some 29,000 troops in afghanistan .
" we must not , we can not , become a two-tiered alliance of those who are willing to fight and those who are not , " gates said .
" such a development , with all its implications for collective security , would effectively destroy the alliance , " gates told delegates at the conference .
in recent weeks , gates has pressed berlin and other allies to provide more troops and resources for the nato force in afghanistan gates soothes tensions with germany the pressure has raised problems for the german government caught between maintaining good relations with washington and selling a risky military mission to increasingly sceptical voters at home .
germany , which has confined its 3,200 troops to the safer north of afghanistan where they are largely involved in civil reconstruction , has repeatedly ruled out sending combat troops to the south .
earlier , the pentagon chief attempted to calm tensions with germany , the third largest troop provider in afghanistan , over nato 's afghan mission , saying ties would not suffer if berlin did not provide fresh troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has warned that troops are overstretched in afghanistan " any additional numbers from any country are most appreciated , " gates told reporters at the conference . " maybe some will be able to help .
it certainly will not be seen as negative in our bilateral relations if some are not able to do more . "
some german politicians criticised gates after his speech , with one accusing him of public " finger pointing , " but the pentagon chief said he had not meant to single out specific countries and called germany " a little overly sensitive . "
" this is a problem that the alliance has , not that any individual country has , " gates said .
" the finger was never pointed in germany 's direction . "
germany defends afghan mission chancellor angela merkel defended germany 's engagement in a newspaper interview published on sunday , and confirmed the country would not alter its mission in afghanistan , despite a report in the weekly der spiegel on saturday that said germany was planning to expand the number of soldiers by 1,000 to 4,500 .
" we 've got a strong engagement with our responsibilities in the north , " she told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , adding " it 's not the case that ' nothing is going on there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel defended germany 's involvement in northern afghanistan " we approved a mandate in parliament just a few months ago for the operation and that remains valid until october .
nothing about that will be changed . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too urged the us to be fair in the row over german troops in afghanistan .
" i 'm not surprised that there are debates over individual contributions .
but they must be fair ones , " steinmeier told german news magazine focus .
gates : europe not aware of danger at the same time , gates said at the security conference that europeans seemed unconvinced by the involvement in afghanistan .
" many europeans question the worth of our actions and doubt whether the mission is worth the lives of their sons and daughters , " gates said .
" fragile coalition governments make it difficult to take on this risk . "
the pentagon chief said he was worried that many people in europe had not understood the magnitude of the direct threat to european security .
gates bemoaned the fact that many europeans were questioning the merits of nato 's role in afghanistan and were calling for their troops to be pulled out , arguing that there was a direct link between the fight against the taliban and the broader fight against islamic terrorism .
" with safe havens in the middle east , and new tactics honed on the battlefield and transmitted via the internet , violence and terrorism worldwide could surge , " he said .
the pentagon chief appealed this week to europeans not to let their opposition to the iraq war color their view of the conflict in afghanistan . " i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused and what i want to try and focus on is why afghanistan is important to europe , " gates said on friday .
" i think they -lsb- the europeans -rsb- combine the two , " gates continued .
" many of them , i think , have a problem with our involvement in iraq and project that to afghanistan and do not understand the very different - for them - the very different kind of threat . "
" soldier for soldier , euro for dollar " gates ' push for more european help in afghanistan was echoed by victoria nuland , the us ambassador to nato .
" we will be urgently requesting all our allies , including germany , at the nato summit in bucharest in april to match us soldier for soldier , euro for dollar , " nuland wrote in an article in german daily berliner zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from the afghan army and canadian troop patroling in kandahar nuland wrote that nato was confronted with the biggest challenge in its 59-year-old history .
" the mission in afghanistan is an investment in our common security and a catalyst for adapting our democratic alliance to the demands of the 21st century , " she wrote .
" if we are successful in the hindukush , we will be stronger the next time we are called upon to defend our security and values far away from home . "
pressure on europeans set to grow pressure on europeans from the us to shoulder more security burdens on the international stage is expected to grow regardless of whether the next us administration is republican or democratic , experts say .
" whoever wins the elections will have to reduce the financial and economic burdens that have resulted from the us ' foreign and security policy commitments , " said horst teltschik , the munich conference organizer this week .
" we will witness more debate on the future international role of nato and burden-sharing in general and on the responsibility shouldered by the europeans for resolving conflicts in particular . "

about two thirds of the initial test subjects participated in the second round of questioning . while less than 15 percent of non-smokers reported having suicidal thoughts , over 30 percent of addicts had considered committing suicide .
the rate for occasional smokers and non-addicted regular smokers was around 20 percent . more research needed none of the test subjects actually took their own life during the study , though almost 70 of them made suicide attempts . " campaigns for reducing smoking should also point to the elevated risk of suicidality for occasional and regular smokers , " wrote the study 's authors in the journal of affective disorders , as reported by dpa news agency . the scientists in charge of the study said that none of the participants had a history of clinical depression or of alcohol or drug abuse .
they also cautioned that , while a connection had been found , no direct causal link had been established and more research was needed . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the series continues in italy . stefania lives in an apartment she owns about 10 minutes by subway from the center of rome .
she works two jobs : in the human resources department of an educational institute and as a private business consultant . monthly income : 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,918.50 -rrb- rent : 400 euros -lrb- $ 590 -rrb- per month in maintenance fees monthly utilities : 130 euros -lrb- $ 192 -rrb- bus / metro ticket : 1.00 euro -lrb- $ 1.47 -rrb- one liter milk : 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.21 -rrb- loaf of bread : 3.00 euros -lrb- $ 4.43 -rrb- domestic stamp : 0.70 euros -lrb- $ 1.03 -rrb- movie ticket : 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- have you noticed that things have become more expensive recently ? the prices have doubled since the introduction of the euro -lsb- at the beginning of 1999 - eds . -rsb- .
more recently some products ' prices have increased , such as bread or some fruits and vegetables .
however , the big price increases happened with the introduction with the euro .
when it comes to petrol the price is increasing constantly - almost every 15 days it rises , in a month it rises a few cents . to what extent does inflation affect you ? when it comes to food items it affects me .
i try to look for things on sale or to compare the prices at different supermarkets when i can .
the salaries are quite low , and the increases in monthly salaries have n't caught up with the increases in prices .
it does have an effect because the salary is always the same but the consumers ' purchasing power is less . how easy is it for you to get by ? fortunately , i 'm by myself so i manage to get by , but i could n't have a family .
i 'm by myself so i have lower expenses , which means i can take a vocational course or go to the gym , but perhaps not as often as i 'd like to .
i manage to have a social life - i ca n't work all the time !
i manage to go to the gym , to take a dance class or take a short trip during the year . would an increase in your wages be necessary to make it easier for you to meet you basic needs ? yes it would be .
the salaries need to be increased by quite a lot here . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? there are countries that are further ahead than us and are growing more .
italy , for example , had its economic boom a decade or so ago , now other countries are having their booms . europe is made up of many different countries with large differences between them so it 's a complex economy . the italian economy has slowed down dramatically and is halted as a result of our government .
there are no courageous steps or encouragement from the politicians .
so the economy is slowing . nb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : expanded german mission in afghanistan germany rejects us pressure as nato 's afghan rift deepens opinion : despite divide , nato has common goal in afghanistan security -pipe- 09.02.2008 gates presses europeans to back afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan topped the agenda at the munich security conference us defense secretary robert gates said the nato alliance was at risk if it became split between members willing and unwilling to fight as he urged europeans to support the afghan mission with more troops . gates sharply criticized european nato partners for holding back from contributing combat troops to afghanistan where a 43,000-strong nato mission is battling taliban insurgents in the country 's dangerous south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates has launched a diplomatic drive to persuade europeans to step up support " a few allies in nato should n't have the luxury to decide only for stabilization and civilian operations thereby forcing other allies to bear a disproportionate share of fighting and dying , " gates told a group of high-profile diplomats at a key security conference in the southern german city of munich on sunday , feb 10 .
the us has some 29,000 troops in afghanistan .
" we must not , we can not , become a two-tiered alliance of those who are willing to fight and those who are not , " gates said .
" such a development , with all its implications for collective security , would effectively destroy the alliance , " gates told delegates at the conference .
in recent weeks , gates has pressed berlin and other allies to provide more troops and resources for the nato force in afghanistan gates soothes tensions with germany the pressure has raised problems for the german government caught between maintaining good relations with washington and selling a risky military mission to increasingly sceptical voters at home .
germany , which has confined its 3,200 troops to the safer north of afghanistan where they are largely involved in civil reconstruction , has repeatedly ruled out sending combat troops to the south .
earlier , the pentagon chief attempted to calm tensions with germany , the third largest troop provider in afghanistan , over nato 's afghan mission , saying ties would not suffer if berlin did not provide fresh troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has warned that troops are overstretched in afghanistan " any additional numbers from any country are most appreciated , " gates told reporters at the conference . " maybe some will be able to help .
it certainly will not be seen as negative in our bilateral relations if some are not able to do more . "
some german politicians criticised gates after his speech , with one accusing him of public " finger pointing , " but the pentagon chief said he had not meant to single out specific countries and called germany " a little overly sensitive . "
" this is a problem that the alliance has , not that any individual country has , " gates said .
" the finger was never pointed in germany 's direction . "
germany defends afghan mission chancellor angela merkel defended germany 's engagement in a newspaper interview published on sunday , and confirmed the country would not alter its mission in afghanistan , despite a report in the weekly der spiegel on saturday that said germany was planning to expand the number of soldiers by 1,000 to 4,500 .
" we 've got a strong engagement with our responsibilities in the north , " she told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , adding " it 's not the case that ' nothing is going on there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel defended germany 's involvement in northern afghanistan " we approved a mandate in parliament just a few months ago for the operation and that remains valid until october .
nothing about that will be changed . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too urged the us to be fair in the row over german troops in afghanistan .
" i 'm not surprised that there are debates over individual contributions .
but they must be fair ones , " steinmeier told german news magazine focus .
gates : europe not aware of danger at the same time , gates said at the security conference that europeans seemed unconvinced by the involvement in afghanistan .
" many europeans question the worth of our actions and doubt whether the mission is worth the lives of their sons and daughters , " gates said .
" fragile coalition governments make it difficult to take on this risk . "
the pentagon chief said he was worried that many people in europe had not understood the magnitude of the direct threat to european security .
gates bemoaned the fact that many europeans were questioning the merits of nato 's role in afghanistan and were calling for their troops to be pulled out , arguing that there was a direct link between the fight against the taliban and the broader fight against islamic terrorism .
" with safe havens in the middle east , and new tactics honed on the battlefield and transmitted via the internet , violence and terrorism worldwide could surge , " he said .
the pentagon chief appealed this week to europeans not to let their opposition to the iraq war color their view of the conflict in afghanistan . " i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused and what i want to try and focus on is why afghanistan is important to europe , " gates said on friday .
" i think they -lsb- the europeans -rsb- combine the two , " gates continued .
" many of them , i think , have a problem with our involvement in iraq and project that to afghanistan and do not understand the very different - for them - the very different kind of threat . "
" soldier for soldier , euro for dollar " gates ' push for more european help in afghanistan was echoed by victoria nuland , the us ambassador to nato .
" we will be urgently requesting all our allies , including germany , at the nato summit in bucharest in april to match us soldier for soldier , euro for dollar , " nuland wrote in an article in german daily berliner zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from the afghan army and canadian troop patroling in kandahar nuland wrote that nato was confronted with the biggest challenge in its 59-year-old history .
" the mission in afghanistan is an investment in our common security and a catalyst for adapting our democratic alliance to the demands of the 21st century , " she wrote .
" if we are successful in the hindukush , we will be stronger the next time we are called upon to defend our security and values far away from home . "
pressure on europeans set to grow pressure on europeans from the us to shoulder more security burdens on the international stage is expected to grow regardless of whether the next us administration is republican or democratic , experts say .
" whoever wins the elections will have to reduce the financial and economic burdens that have resulted from the us ' foreign and security policy commitments , " said horst teltschik , the munich conference organizer this week .
" we will witness more debate on the future international role of nato and burden-sharing in general and on the responsibility shouldered by the europeans for resolving conflicts in particular . "
" a world in disarray " the annual roundtable in munich 's luxurious bayerischer hof hotel was attended by a handful of presidents , dozens of government ministers and hundreds of security experts from some 50 countries .
the conference 's theme - " a world in disarray - shifting powers lack of strategies " - saw delegates exchange views on a broad variety of issues , such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the widening rift between the west and vladimir putin 's russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leftwing protestors demonstrated against the conference in munich speakers included turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and mohamed elbaradei , head of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates has launched a diplomatic drive to persuade europeans to step up support " a few allies in nato should n't have the luxury to decide only for stabilization and civilian operations thereby forcing other allies to bear a disproportionate share of fighting and dying , " gates told a group of high-profile diplomats at a key security conference in the southern german city of munich on sunday , feb 10 .
the us has some 29,000 troops in afghanistan .
" we must not , we can not , become a two-tiered alliance of those who are willing to fight and those who are not , " gates said .
" such a development , with all its implications for collective security , would effectively destroy the alliance , " gates told delegates at the conference .
in recent weeks , gates has pressed berlin and other allies to provide more troops and resources for the nato force in afghanistan gates soothes tensions with germany the pressure has raised problems for the german government caught between maintaining good relations with washington and selling a risky military mission to increasingly sceptical voters at home .
germany , which has confined its 3,200 troops to the safer north of afghanistan where they are largely involved in civil reconstruction , has repeatedly ruled out sending combat troops to the south .
earlier , the pentagon chief attempted to calm tensions with germany , the third largest troop provider in afghanistan , over nato 's afghan mission , saying ties would not suffer if berlin did not provide fresh troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has warned that troops are overstretched in afghanistan " any additional numbers from any country are most appreciated , " gates told reporters at the conference . " maybe some will be able to help .
it certainly will not be seen as negative in our bilateral relations if some are not able to do more . "
some german politicians criticised gates after his speech , with one accusing him of public " finger pointing , " but the pentagon chief said he had not meant to single out specific countries and called germany " a little overly sensitive . "
" this is a problem that the alliance has , not that any individual country has , " gates said .
" the finger was never pointed in germany 's direction . "
germany defends afghan mission chancellor angela merkel defended germany 's engagement in a newspaper interview published on sunday , and confirmed the country would not alter its mission in afghanistan , despite a report in the weekly der spiegel on saturday that said germany was planning to expand the number of soldiers by 1,000 to 4,500 .
" we 've got a strong engagement with our responsibilities in the north , " she told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , adding " it 's not the case that ' nothing is going on there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel defended germany 's involvement in northern afghanistan " we approved a mandate in parliament just a few months ago for the operation and that remains valid until october .
nothing about that will be changed . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too urged the us to be fair in the row over german troops in afghanistan .
" i 'm not surprised that there are debates over individual contributions .
but they must be fair ones , " steinmeier told german news magazine focus .
gates : europe not aware of danger at the same time , gates said at the security conference that europeans seemed unconvinced by the involvement in afghanistan .
" many europeans question the worth of our actions and doubt whether the mission is worth the lives of their sons and daughters , " gates said .
" fragile coalition governments make it difficult to take on this risk . "
the pentagon chief said he was worried that many people in europe had not understood the magnitude of the direct threat to european security .
gates bemoaned the fact that many europeans were questioning the merits of nato 's role in afghanistan and were calling for their troops to be pulled out , arguing that there was a direct link between the fight against the taliban and the broader fight against islamic terrorism .
" with safe havens in the middle east , and new tactics honed on the battlefield and transmitted via the internet , violence and terrorism worldwide could surge , " he said .
the pentagon chief appealed this week to europeans not to let their opposition to the iraq war color their view of the conflict in afghanistan . " i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused and what i want to try and focus on is why afghanistan is important to europe , " gates said on friday .
" i think they -lsb- the europeans -rsb- combine the two , " gates continued .
" many of them , i think , have a problem with our involvement in iraq and project that to afghanistan and do not understand the very different - for them - the very different kind of threat . "
" soldier for soldier , euro for dollar " gates ' push for more european help in afghanistan was echoed by victoria nuland , the us ambassador to nato .
" we will be urgently requesting all our allies , including germany , at the nato summit in bucharest in april to match us soldier for soldier , euro for dollar , " nuland wrote in an article in german daily berliner zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from the afghan army and canadian troop patroling in kandahar nuland wrote that nato was confronted with the biggest challenge in its 59-year-old history .
" the mission in afghanistan is an investment in our common security and a catalyst for adapting our democratic alliance to the demands of the 21st century , " she wrote .
" if we are successful in the hindukush , we will be stronger the next time we are called upon to defend our security and values far away from home . "
pressure on europeans set to grow pressure on europeans from the us to shoulder more security burdens on the international stage is expected to grow regardless of whether the next us administration is republican or democratic , experts say .
" whoever wins the elections will have to reduce the financial and economic burdens that have resulted from the us ' foreign and security policy commitments , " said horst teltschik , the munich conference organizer this week .
" we will witness more debate on the future international role of nato and burden-sharing in general and on the responsibility shouldered by the europeans for resolving conflicts in particular . "
" a world in disarray " the annual roundtable in munich 's luxurious bayerischer hof hotel was attended by a handful of presidents , dozens of government ministers and hundreds of security experts from some 50 countries .
the conference 's theme - " a world in disarray - shifting powers lack of strategies " - saw delegates exchange views on a broad variety of issues , such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the widening rift between the west and vladimir putin 's russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leftwing protestors demonstrated against the conference in munich speakers included turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and mohamed elbaradei , head of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates has launched a diplomatic drive to persuade europeans to step up support " a few allies in nato should n't have the luxury to decide only for stabilization and civilian operations thereby forcing other allies to bear a disproportionate share of fighting and dying , " gates told a group of high-profile diplomats at a key security conference in the southern german city of munich on sunday , feb 10 .
the us has some 29,000 troops in afghanistan .
" we must not , we can not , become a two-tiered alliance of those who are willing to fight and those who are not , " gates said .
" such a development , with all its implications for collective security , would effectively destroy the alliance , " gates told delegates at the conference .
in recent weeks , gates has pressed berlin and other allies to provide more troops and resources for the nato force in afghanistan gates soothes tensions with germany the pressure has raised problems for the german government caught between maintaining good relations with washington and selling a risky military mission to increasingly sceptical voters at home .
germany , which has confined its 3,200 troops to the safer north of afghanistan where they are largely involved in civil reconstruction , has repeatedly ruled out sending combat troops to the south .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : expanded german mission in afghanistan germany rejects us pressure as nato 's afghan rift deepens opinion : despite divide , nato has common goal in afghanistan security -pipe- 09.02.2008 gates presses europeans to back afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan topped the agenda at the munich security conference us defense secretary robert gates said the nato alliance was at risk if it became split between members willing and unwilling to fight as he urged europeans to support the afghan mission with more troops . gates sharply criticized european nato partners for holding back from contributing combat troops to afghanistan where a 43,000-strong nato mission is battling taliban insurgents in the country 's dangerous south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates has launched a diplomatic drive to persuade europeans to step up support " a few allies in nato should n't have the luxury to decide only for stabilization and civilian operations thereby forcing other allies to bear a disproportionate share of fighting and dying , " gates told a group of high-profile diplomats at a key security conference in the southern german city of munich on sunday , feb 10 .
the us has some 29,000 troops in afghanistan .
" we must not , we can not , become a two-tiered alliance of those who are willing to fight and those who are not , " gates said .
" such a development , with all its implications for collective security , would effectively destroy the alliance , " gates told delegates at the conference .
in recent weeks , gates has pressed berlin and other allies to provide more troops and resources for the nato force in afghanistan gates soothes tensions with germany the pressure has raised problems for the german government caught between maintaining good relations with washington and selling a risky military mission to increasingly sceptical voters at home .
germany , which has confined its 3,200 troops to the safer north of afghanistan where they are largely involved in civil reconstruction , has repeatedly ruled out sending combat troops to the south .
earlier , the pentagon chief attempted to calm tensions with germany , the third largest troop provider in afghanistan , over nato 's afghan mission , saying ties would not suffer if berlin did not provide fresh troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has warned that troops are overstretched in afghanistan " any additional numbers from any country are most appreciated , " gates told reporters at the conference . " maybe some will be able to help .
it certainly will not be seen as negative in our bilateral relations if some are not able to do more . "
some german politicians criticised gates after his speech , with one accusing him of public " finger pointing , " but the pentagon chief said he had not meant to single out specific countries and called germany " a little overly sensitive . "
" this is a problem that the alliance has , not that any individual country has , " gates said .
" the finger was never pointed in germany 's direction . "
germany defends afghan mission chancellor angela merkel defended germany 's engagement in a newspaper interview published on sunday , and confirmed the country would not alter its mission in afghanistan , despite a report in the weekly der spiegel on saturday that said germany was planning to expand the number of soldiers by 1,000 to 4,500 .
" we 've got a strong engagement with our responsibilities in the north , " she told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , adding " it 's not the case that ' nothing is going on there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel defended germany 's involvement in northern afghanistan " we approved a mandate in parliament just a few months ago for the operation and that remains valid until october .
nothing about that will be changed . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too urged the us to be fair in the row over german troops in afghanistan .
" i 'm not surprised that there are debates over individual contributions .
but they must be fair ones , " steinmeier told german news magazine focus .
gates : europe not aware of danger at the same time , gates said at the security conference that europeans seemed unconvinced by the involvement in afghanistan .
" many europeans question the worth of our actions and doubt whether the mission is worth the lives of their sons and daughters , " gates said .
" fragile coalition governments make it difficult to take on this risk . "
the pentagon chief said he was worried that many people in europe had not understood the magnitude of the direct threat to european security .
gates bemoaned the fact that many europeans were questioning the merits of nato 's role in afghanistan and were calling for their troops to be pulled out , arguing that there was a direct link between the fight against the taliban and the broader fight against islamic terrorism .
" with safe havens in the middle east , and new tactics honed on the battlefield and transmitted via the internet , violence and terrorism worldwide could surge , " he said .
the pentagon chief appealed this week to europeans not to let their opposition to the iraq war color their view of the conflict in afghanistan . " i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused and what i want to try and focus on is why afghanistan is important to europe , " gates said on friday .
" i think they -lsb- the europeans -rsb- combine the two , " gates continued .
" many of them , i think , have a problem with our involvement in iraq and project that to afghanistan and do not understand the very different - for them - the very different kind of threat . "
" soldier for soldier , euro for dollar " gates ' push for more european help in afghanistan was echoed by victoria nuland , the us ambassador to nato .
" we will be urgently requesting all our allies , including germany , at the nato summit in bucharest in april to match us soldier for soldier , euro for dollar , " nuland wrote in an article in german daily berliner zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from the afghan army and canadian troop patroling in kandahar nuland wrote that nato was confronted with the biggest challenge in its 59-year-old history .
" the mission in afghanistan is an investment in our common security and a catalyst for adapting our democratic alliance to the demands of the 21st century , " she wrote .
" if we are successful in the hindukush , we will be stronger the next time we are called upon to defend our security and values far away from home . "
pressure on europeans set to grow pressure on europeans from the us to shoulder more security burdens on the international stage is expected to grow regardless of whether the next us administration is republican or democratic , experts say .
" whoever wins the elections will have to reduce the financial and economic burdens that have resulted from the us ' foreign and security policy commitments , " said horst teltschik , the munich conference organizer this week .
" we will witness more debate on the future international role of nato and burden-sharing in general and on the responsibility shouldered by the europeans for resolving conflicts in particular . "
" a world in disarray " the annual roundtable in munich 's luxurious bayerischer hof hotel was attended by a handful of presidents , dozens of government ministers and hundreds of security experts from some 50 countries .
the conference 's theme - " a world in disarray - shifting powers lack of strategies " - saw delegates exchange views on a broad variety of issues , such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the widening rift between the west and vladimir putin 's russia .

between 15,000 and 20,000 lobbyists are said to work here for economic and professional bodies .
the german association of fire brigades -lrb- dvf -rrb- recently became the latest group to open an office in brussels .
some people might find this strange .
but decisions from brussels have an enormous impact on the everyday working life of each individual fireman , says dvf spokesman sönke jacobs .
the eu decides which driving license the uniform-clad heroes need , how long they 're allowed to work and what their protective clothing is supposed to look like .
however , it had taken a while for the fire brigade to realize this .
" we only discovered brussels in the past three or four years , " jacobs said .
the german federal states meanwhile have been trying for years to influence eu commission officials and legislators .
each state has its own diplomatic representation , except for the city-state of hamburg and its northern neighbour , schleswig-holstein , who share a building .
others have expanded rapidly in recent years , with the bavarians even residing in their own palace .
lobbyists taking over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians of all 27-member states are ripe for the picking eu institutions and lobbies are taking up 3.5 million square meters of space in brussels , according to the brussels-europe liaison-office .
bernd dittmann is in charge of a representation with offices on seven levels .
having chaired the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- for 10 years , he is a veteran of the brussels scene .
nevertheless , he is surprised every now and then .
" i 'm sometimes amazed about all the pressure groups that exist , " he said , adding that he thinks the number of lobbyists ' offices has grown steadily over the years .
" after washington , brussels is the worlds ' largest lobbyists ' city , " said erik wesselius of the corporate europe observatory .
the amsterdam-based non-governmental organization observes the economic and political power of lobbyists .
huge sums spent on buying influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists reach out to the decision makers in brussels the organization estimates that the lobbyists spend up to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- a year to influence decision-makers in brussels .
but even wesselius does n't know how many representations there actually are in the city .
" we need a mandatory list that can make the influx of money more transparent , " the lobby observer said .
the eu commission is planning to set up a register this summer , even though signing up will be voluntary .
but wesselius thinks little of the idea .
" many lobbyists have already indicated they will not register because they would have to reveal their clients and their income , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the series continues in italy . stefania lives in an apartment she owns about 10 minutes by subway from the center of rome .
she works two jobs : in the human resources department of an educational institute and as a private business consultant . monthly income : 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,918.50 -rrb- rent : 400 euros -lrb- $ 590 -rrb- per month in maintenance fees monthly utilities : 130 euros -lrb- $ 192 -rrb- bus / metro ticket : 1.00 euro -lrb- $ 1.47 -rrb- one liter milk : 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2.21 -rrb- loaf of bread : 3.00 euros -lrb- $ 4.43 -rrb- domestic stamp : 0.70 euros -lrb- $ 1.03 -rrb- movie ticket : 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- have you noticed that things have become more expensive recently ? the prices have doubled since the introduction of the euro -lsb- at the beginning of 1999 - eds . -rsb- .
more recently some products ' prices have increased , such as bread or some fruits and vegetables .
however , the big price increases happened with the introduction with the euro .
when it comes to petrol the price is increasing constantly - almost every 15 days it rises , in a month it rises a few cents . to what extent does inflation affect you ? when it comes to food items it affects me .
i try to look for things on sale or to compare the prices at different supermarkets when i can .
the salaries are quite low , and the increases in monthly salaries have n't caught up with the increases in prices .
it does have an effect because the salary is always the same but the consumers ' purchasing power is less . how easy is it for you to get by ? fortunately , i 'm by myself so i manage to get by , but i could n't have a family .
i 'm by myself so i have lower expenses , which means i can take a vocational course or go to the gym , but perhaps not as often as i 'd like to .
i manage to have a social life - i ca n't work all the time !
i manage to go to the gym , to take a dance class or take a short trip during the year . would an increase in your wages be necessary to make it easier for you to meet you basic needs ? yes it would be .
the salaries need to be increased by quite a lot here . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? there are countries that are further ahead than us and are growing more .
italy , for example , had its economic boom a decade or so ago , now other countries are having their booms . europe is made up of many different countries with large differences between them so it 's a complex economy . the italian economy has slowed down dramatically and is halted as a result of our government .
there are no courageous steps or encouragement from the politicians .
so the economy is slowing . nb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : expanded german mission in afghanistan germany rejects us pressure as nato 's afghan rift deepens opinion : despite divide , nato has common goal in afghanistan security -pipe- 09.02.2008 gates presses europeans to back afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan topped the agenda at the munich security conference us defense secretary robert gates said the nato alliance was at risk if it became split between members willing and unwilling to fight as he urged europeans to support the afghan mission with more troops . gates sharply criticized european nato partners for holding back from contributing combat troops to afghanistan where a 43,000-strong nato mission is battling taliban insurgents in the country 's dangerous south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates has launched a diplomatic drive to persuade europeans to step up support " a few allies in nato should n't have the luxury to decide only for stabilization and civilian operations thereby forcing other allies to bear a disproportionate share of fighting and dying , " gates told a group of high-profile diplomats at a key security conference in the southern german city of munich on sunday , feb 10 .
the us has some 29,000 troops in afghanistan .
" we must not , we can not , become a two-tiered alliance of those who are willing to fight and those who are not , " gates said .
" such a development , with all its implications for collective security , would effectively destroy the alliance , " gates told delegates at the conference .
in recent weeks , gates has pressed berlin and other allies to provide more troops and resources for the nato force in afghanistan gates soothes tensions with germany the pressure has raised problems for the german government caught between maintaining good relations with washington and selling a risky military mission to increasingly sceptical voters at home .
germany , which has confined its 3,200 troops to the safer north of afghanistan where they are largely involved in civil reconstruction , has repeatedly ruled out sending combat troops to the south .
earlier , the pentagon chief attempted to calm tensions with germany , the third largest troop provider in afghanistan , over nato 's afghan mission , saying ties would not suffer if berlin did not provide fresh troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has warned that troops are overstretched in afghanistan " any additional numbers from any country are most appreciated , " gates told reporters at the conference . " maybe some will be able to help .
it certainly will not be seen as negative in our bilateral relations if some are not able to do more . "
some german politicians criticised gates after his speech , with one accusing him of public " finger pointing , " but the pentagon chief said he had not meant to single out specific countries and called germany " a little overly sensitive . "
" this is a problem that the alliance has , not that any individual country has , " gates said .
" the finger was never pointed in germany 's direction . "
germany defends afghan mission chancellor angela merkel defended germany 's engagement in a newspaper interview published on sunday , and confirmed the country would not alter its mission in afghanistan , despite a report in the weekly der spiegel on saturday that said germany was planning to expand the number of soldiers by 1,000 to 4,500 .
" we 've got a strong engagement with our responsibilities in the north , " she told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , adding " it 's not the case that ' nothing is going on there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel defended germany 's involvement in northern afghanistan " we approved a mandate in parliament just a few months ago for the operation and that remains valid until october .
nothing about that will be changed . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too urged the us to be fair in the row over german troops in afghanistan .
" i 'm not surprised that there are debates over individual contributions .
but they must be fair ones , " steinmeier told german news magazine focus .
gates : europe not aware of danger at the same time , gates said at the security conference that europeans seemed unconvinced by the involvement in afghanistan .
" many europeans question the worth of our actions and doubt whether the mission is worth the lives of their sons and daughters , " gates said .
" fragile coalition governments make it difficult to take on this risk . "
the pentagon chief said he was worried that many people in europe had not understood the magnitude of the direct threat to european security .
gates bemoaned the fact that many europeans were questioning the merits of nato 's role in afghanistan and were calling for their troops to be pulled out , arguing that there was a direct link between the fight against the taliban and the broader fight against islamic terrorism .
" with safe havens in the middle east , and new tactics honed on the battlefield and transmitted via the internet , violence and terrorism worldwide could surge , " he said .
the pentagon chief appealed this week to europeans not to let their opposition to the iraq war color their view of the conflict in afghanistan . " i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused and what i want to try and focus on is why afghanistan is important to europe , " gates said on friday .
" i think they -lsb- the europeans -rsb- combine the two , " gates continued .
" many of them , i think , have a problem with our involvement in iraq and project that to afghanistan and do not understand the very different - for them - the very different kind of threat . "
" soldier for soldier , euro for dollar " gates ' push for more european help in afghanistan was echoed by victoria nuland , the us ambassador to nato .
" we will be urgently requesting all our allies , including germany , at the nato summit in bucharest in april to match us soldier for soldier , euro for dollar , " nuland wrote in an article in german daily berliner zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from the afghan army and canadian troop patroling in kandahar nuland wrote that nato was confronted with the biggest challenge in its 59-year-old history .
" the mission in afghanistan is an investment in our common security and a catalyst for adapting our democratic alliance to the demands of the 21st century , " she wrote .
" if we are successful in the hindukush , we will be stronger the next time we are called upon to defend our security and values far away from home . "
pressure on europeans set to grow pressure on europeans from the us to shoulder more security burdens on the international stage is expected to grow regardless of whether the next us administration is republican or democratic , experts say .
" whoever wins the elections will have to reduce the financial and economic burdens that have resulted from the us ' foreign and security policy commitments , " said horst teltschik , the munich conference organizer this week .
" we will witness more debate on the future international role of nato and burden-sharing in general and on the responsibility shouldered by the europeans for resolving conflicts in particular . "
" a world in disarray " the annual roundtable in munich 's luxurious bayerischer hof hotel was attended by a handful of presidents , dozens of government ministers and hundreds of security experts from some 50 countries .
the conference 's theme - " a world in disarray - shifting powers lack of strategies " - saw delegates exchange views on a broad variety of issues , such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the widening rift between the west and vladimir putin 's russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leftwing protestors demonstrated against the conference in munich speakers included turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and mohamed elbaradei , head of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates has launched a diplomatic drive to persuade europeans to step up support " a few allies in nato should n't have the luxury to decide only for stabilization and civilian operations thereby forcing other allies to bear a disproportionate share of fighting and dying , " gates told a group of high-profile diplomats at a key security conference in the southern german city of munich on sunday , feb 10 .
the us has some 29,000 troops in afghanistan .
" we must not , we can not , become a two-tiered alliance of those who are willing to fight and those who are not , " gates said .
" such a development , with all its implications for collective security , would effectively destroy the alliance , " gates told delegates at the conference .
in recent weeks , gates has pressed berlin and other allies to provide more troops and resources for the nato force in afghanistan gates soothes tensions with germany the pressure has raised problems for the german government caught between maintaining good relations with washington and selling a risky military mission to increasingly sceptical voters at home .
germany , which has confined its 3,200 troops to the safer north of afghanistan where they are largely involved in civil reconstruction , has repeatedly ruled out sending combat troops to the south .
earlier , the pentagon chief attempted to calm tensions with germany , the third largest troop provider in afghanistan , over nato 's afghan mission , saying ties would not suffer if berlin did not provide fresh troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has warned that troops are overstretched in afghanistan " any additional numbers from any country are most appreciated , " gates told reporters at the conference . " maybe some will be able to help .
it certainly will not be seen as negative in our bilateral relations if some are not able to do more . "
some german politicians criticised gates after his speech , with one accusing him of public " finger pointing , " but the pentagon chief said he had not meant to single out specific countries and called germany " a little overly sensitive . "
" this is a problem that the alliance has , not that any individual country has , " gates said .
" the finger was never pointed in germany 's direction . "
germany defends afghan mission chancellor angela merkel defended germany 's engagement in a newspaper interview published on sunday , and confirmed the country would not alter its mission in afghanistan , despite a report in the weekly der spiegel on saturday that said germany was planning to expand the number of soldiers by 1,000 to 4,500 .
" we 've got a strong engagement with our responsibilities in the north , " she told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , adding " it 's not the case that ' nothing is going on there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel defended germany 's involvement in northern afghanistan " we approved a mandate in parliament just a few months ago for the operation and that remains valid until october .
nothing about that will be changed . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too urged the us to be fair in the row over german troops in afghanistan .
" i 'm not surprised that there are debates over individual contributions .
but they must be fair ones , " steinmeier told german news magazine focus .
gates : europe not aware of danger at the same time , gates said at the security conference that europeans seemed unconvinced by the involvement in afghanistan .
" many europeans question the worth of our actions and doubt whether the mission is worth the lives of their sons and daughters , " gates said .
" fragile coalition governments make it difficult to take on this risk . "
the pentagon chief said he was worried that many people in europe had not understood the magnitude of the direct threat to european security .
gates bemoaned the fact that many europeans were questioning the merits of nato 's role in afghanistan and were calling for their troops to be pulled out , arguing that there was a direct link between the fight against the taliban and the broader fight against islamic terrorism .
" with safe havens in the middle east , and new tactics honed on the battlefield and transmitted via the internet , violence and terrorism worldwide could surge , " he said .
the pentagon chief appealed this week to europeans not to let their opposition to the iraq war color their view of the conflict in afghanistan . " i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused and what i want to try and focus on is why afghanistan is important to europe , " gates said on friday .
" i think they -lsb- the europeans -rsb- combine the two , " gates continued .
" many of them , i think , have a problem with our involvement in iraq and project that to afghanistan and do not understand the very different - for them - the very different kind of threat . "
" soldier for soldier , euro for dollar " gates ' push for more european help in afghanistan was echoed by victoria nuland , the us ambassador to nato .
" we will be urgently requesting all our allies , including germany , at the nato summit in bucharest in april to match us soldier for soldier , euro for dollar , " nuland wrote in an article in german daily berliner zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from the afghan army and canadian troop patroling in kandahar nuland wrote that nato was confronted with the biggest challenge in its 59-year-old history .
" the mission in afghanistan is an investment in our common security and a catalyst for adapting our democratic alliance to the demands of the 21st century , " she wrote .
" if we are successful in the hindukush , we will be stronger the next time we are called upon to defend our security and values far away from home . "
pressure on europeans set to grow pressure on europeans from the us to shoulder more security burdens on the international stage is expected to grow regardless of whether the next us administration is republican or democratic , experts say .
" whoever wins the elections will have to reduce the financial and economic burdens that have resulted from the us ' foreign and security policy commitments , " said horst teltschik , the munich conference organizer this week .
" we will witness more debate on the future international role of nato and burden-sharing in general and on the responsibility shouldered by the europeans for resolving conflicts in particular . "
" a world in disarray " the annual roundtable in munich 's luxurious bayerischer hof hotel was attended by a handful of presidents , dozens of government ministers and hundreds of security experts from some 50 countries .
the conference 's theme - " a world in disarray - shifting powers lack of strategies " - saw delegates exchange views on a broad variety of issues , such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the widening rift between the west and vladimir putin 's russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leftwing protestors demonstrated against the conference in munich speakers included turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and mohamed elbaradei , head of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .

earlier , the pentagon chief attempted to calm tensions with germany , the third largest troop provider in afghanistan , over nato 's afghan mission , saying ties would not suffer if berlin did not provide fresh troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has warned that troops are overstretched in afghanistan " any additional numbers from any country are most appreciated , " gates told reporters at the conference . " maybe some will be able to help .
it certainly will not be seen as negative in our bilateral relations if some are not able to do more . "
some german politicians criticised gates after his speech , with one accusing him of public " finger pointing , " but the pentagon chief said he had not meant to single out specific countries and called germany " a little overly sensitive . "
" this is a problem that the alliance has , not that any individual country has , " gates said .
" the finger was never pointed in germany 's direction . "
germany defends afghan mission chancellor angela merkel defended germany 's engagement in a newspaper interview published on sunday , and confirmed the country would not alter its mission in afghanistan , despite a report in the weekly der spiegel on saturday that said germany was planning to expand the number of soldiers by 1,000 to 4,500 .
" we 've got a strong engagement with our responsibilities in the north , " she told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , adding " it 's not the case that ' nothing is going on there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel defended germany 's involvement in northern afghanistan " we approved a mandate in parliament just a few months ago for the operation and that remains valid until october .
nothing about that will be changed . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too urged the us to be fair in the row over german troops in afghanistan .
" i 'm not surprised that there are debates over individual contributions .
but they must be fair ones , " steinmeier told german news magazine focus .
gates : europe not aware of danger at the same time , gates said at the security conference that europeans seemed unconvinced by the involvement in afghanistan .
" many europeans question the worth of our actions and doubt whether the mission is worth the lives of their sons and daughters , " gates said .
" fragile coalition governments make it difficult to take on this risk . "
the pentagon chief said he was worried that many people in europe had not understood the magnitude of the direct threat to european security .
gates bemoaned the fact that many europeans were questioning the merits of nato 's role in afghanistan and were calling for their troops to be pulled out , arguing that there was a direct link between the fight against the taliban and the broader fight against islamic terrorism .
" with safe havens in the middle east , and new tactics honed on the battlefield and transmitted via the internet , violence and terrorism worldwide could surge , " he said .
the pentagon chief appealed this week to europeans not to let their opposition to the iraq war color their view of the conflict in afghanistan . " i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused and what i want to try and focus on is why afghanistan is important to europe , " gates said on friday .
" i think they -lsb- the europeans -rsb- combine the two , " gates continued .
" many of them , i think , have a problem with our involvement in iraq and project that to afghanistan and do not understand the very different - for them - the very different kind of threat . "
" soldier for soldier , euro for dollar " gates ' push for more european help in afghanistan was echoed by victoria nuland , the us ambassador to nato .
" we will be urgently requesting all our allies , including germany , at the nato summit in bucharest in april to match us soldier for soldier , euro for dollar , " nuland wrote in an article in german daily berliner zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from the afghan army and canadian troop patroling in kandahar nuland wrote that nato was confronted with the biggest challenge in its 59-year-old history .
" the mission in afghanistan is an investment in our common security and a catalyst for adapting our democratic alliance to the demands of the 21st century , " she wrote .
" if we are successful in the hindukush , we will be stronger the next time we are called upon to defend our security and values far away from home . "
pressure on europeans set to grow pressure on europeans from the us to shoulder more security burdens on the international stage is expected to grow regardless of whether the next us administration is republican or democratic , experts say .
" whoever wins the elections will have to reduce the financial and economic burdens that have resulted from the us ' foreign and security policy commitments , " said horst teltschik , the munich conference organizer this week .
" we will witness more debate on the future international role of nato and burden-sharing in general and on the responsibility shouldered by the europeans for resolving conflicts in particular . "
" a world in disarray " the annual roundtable in munich 's luxurious bayerischer hof hotel was attended by a handful of presidents , dozens of government ministers and hundreds of security experts from some 50 countries .
the conference 's theme - " a world in disarray - shifting powers lack of strategies " - saw delegates exchange views on a broad variety of issues , such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the widening rift between the west and vladimir putin 's russia .

in recent weeks , gates has pressed berlin and other allies to provide more troops and resources for the nato force in afghanistan gates soothes tensions with germany the pressure has raised problems for the german government caught between maintaining good relations with washington and selling a risky military mission to increasingly sceptical voters at home .
germany , which has confined its 3,200 troops to the safer north of afghanistan where they are largely involved in civil reconstruction , has repeatedly ruled out sending combat troops to the south .
earlier , the pentagon chief attempted to calm tensions with germany , the third largest troop provider in afghanistan , over nato 's afghan mission , saying ties would not suffer if berlin did not provide fresh troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has warned that troops are overstretched in afghanistan " any additional numbers from any country are most appreciated , " gates told reporters at the conference . " maybe some will be able to help .
it certainly will not be seen as negative in our bilateral relations if some are not able to do more . "
some german politicians criticised gates after his speech , with one accusing him of public " finger pointing , " but the pentagon chief said he had not meant to single out specific countries and called germany " a little overly sensitive . "
" this is a problem that the alliance has , not that any individual country has , " gates said .
" the finger was never pointed in germany 's direction . "
germany defends afghan mission chancellor angela merkel defended germany 's engagement in a newspaper interview published on sunday , and confirmed the country would not alter its mission in afghanistan , despite a report in the weekly der spiegel on saturday that said germany was planning to expand the number of soldiers by 1,000 to 4,500 .
" we 've got a strong engagement with our responsibilities in the north , " she told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , adding " it 's not the case that ' nothing is going on there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel defended germany 's involvement in northern afghanistan " we approved a mandate in parliament just a few months ago for the operation and that remains valid until october .
nothing about that will be changed . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too urged the us to be fair in the row over german troops in afghanistan .
" i 'm not surprised that there are debates over individual contributions .
but they must be fair ones , " steinmeier told german news magazine focus .
gates : europe not aware of danger at the same time , gates said at the security conference that europeans seemed unconvinced by the involvement in afghanistan .
" many europeans question the worth of our actions and doubt whether the mission is worth the lives of their sons and daughters , " gates said .
" fragile coalition governments make it difficult to take on this risk . "
the pentagon chief said he was worried that many people in europe had not understood the magnitude of the direct threat to european security .
gates bemoaned the fact that many europeans were questioning the merits of nato 's role in afghanistan and were calling for their troops to be pulled out , arguing that there was a direct link between the fight against the taliban and the broader fight against islamic terrorism .
" with safe havens in the middle east , and new tactics honed on the battlefield and transmitted via the internet , violence and terrorism worldwide could surge , " he said .
the pentagon chief appealed this week to europeans not to let their opposition to the iraq war color their view of the conflict in afghanistan . " i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused and what i want to try and focus on is why afghanistan is important to europe , " gates said on friday .
" i think they -lsb- the europeans -rsb- combine the two , " gates continued .
" many of them , i think , have a problem with our involvement in iraq and project that to afghanistan and do not understand the very different - for them - the very different kind of threat . "
" soldier for soldier , euro for dollar " gates ' push for more european help in afghanistan was echoed by victoria nuland , the us ambassador to nato .
" we will be urgently requesting all our allies , including germany , at the nato summit in bucharest in april to match us soldier for soldier , euro for dollar , " nuland wrote in an article in german daily berliner zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from the afghan army and canadian troop patroling in kandahar nuland wrote that nato was confronted with the biggest challenge in its 59-year-old history .

" if we are successful in the hindukush , we will be stronger the next time we are called upon to defend our security and values far away from home . "
pressure on europeans set to grow pressure on europeans from the us to shoulder more security burdens on the international stage is expected to grow regardless of whether the next us administration is republican or democratic , experts say .
" whoever wins the elections will have to reduce the financial and economic burdens that have resulted from the us ' foreign and security policy commitments , " said horst teltschik , the munich conference organizer this week .
" we will witness more debate on the future international role of nato and burden-sharing in general and on the responsibility shouldered by the europeans for resolving conflicts in particular . "
" a world in disarray " the annual roundtable in munich 's luxurious bayerischer hof hotel was attended by a handful of presidents , dozens of government ministers and hundreds of security experts from some 50 countries .
the conference 's theme - " a world in disarray - shifting powers lack of strategies " - saw delegates exchange views on a broad variety of issues , such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the widening rift between the west and vladimir putin 's russia .

the us has some 29,000 troops in afghanistan .
" we must not , we can not , become a two-tiered alliance of those who are willing to fight and those who are not , " gates said .
" such a development , with all its implications for collective security , would effectively destroy the alliance , " gates told delegates at the conference .
in recent weeks , gates has pressed berlin and other allies to provide more troops and resources for the nato force in afghanistan gates soothes tensions with germany the pressure has raised problems for the german government caught between maintaining good relations with washington and selling a risky military mission to increasingly sceptical voters at home .
germany , which has confined its 3,200 troops to the safer north of afghanistan where they are largely involved in civil reconstruction , has repeatedly ruled out sending combat troops to the south .
earlier , the pentagon chief attempted to calm tensions with germany , the third largest troop provider in afghanistan , over nato 's afghan mission , saying ties would not suffer if berlin did not provide fresh troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has warned that troops are overstretched in afghanistan " any additional numbers from any country are most appreciated , " gates told reporters at the conference . " maybe some will be able to help .
it certainly will not be seen as negative in our bilateral relations if some are not able to do more . "
some german politicians criticised gates after his speech , with one accusing him of public " finger pointing , " but the pentagon chief said he had not meant to single out specific countries and called germany " a little overly sensitive . "
" this is a problem that the alliance has , not that any individual country has , " gates said .
" the finger was never pointed in germany 's direction . "
germany defends afghan mission chancellor angela merkel defended germany 's engagement in a newspaper interview published on sunday , and confirmed the country would not alter its mission in afghanistan , despite a report in the weekly der spiegel on saturday that said germany was planning to expand the number of soldiers by 1,000 to 4,500 .
" we 've got a strong engagement with our responsibilities in the north , " she told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , adding " it 's not the case that ' nothing is going on there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel defended germany 's involvement in northern afghanistan " we approved a mandate in parliament just a few months ago for the operation and that remains valid until october .
nothing about that will be changed . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too urged the us to be fair in the row over german troops in afghanistan .
" i 'm not surprised that there are debates over individual contributions .
but they must be fair ones , " steinmeier told german news magazine focus .
gates : europe not aware of danger at the same time , gates said at the security conference that europeans seemed unconvinced by the involvement in afghanistan .
" many europeans question the worth of our actions and doubt whether the mission is worth the lives of their sons and daughters , " gates said .
" fragile coalition governments make it difficult to take on this risk . "
the pentagon chief said he was worried that many people in europe had not understood the magnitude of the direct threat to european security .
gates bemoaned the fact that many europeans were questioning the merits of nato 's role in afghanistan and were calling for their troops to be pulled out , arguing that there was a direct link between the fight against the taliban and the broader fight against islamic terrorism .
" with safe havens in the middle east , and new tactics honed on the battlefield and transmitted via the internet , violence and terrorism worldwide could surge , " he said .
the pentagon chief appealed this week to europeans not to let their opposition to the iraq war color their view of the conflict in afghanistan . " i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused and what i want to try and focus on is why afghanistan is important to europe , " gates said on friday .
" i think they -lsb- the europeans -rsb- combine the two , " gates continued .
" many of them , i think , have a problem with our involvement in iraq and project that to afghanistan and do not understand the very different - for them - the very different kind of threat . "
" soldier for soldier , euro for dollar " gates ' push for more european help in afghanistan was echoed by victoria nuland , the us ambassador to nato .
" we will be urgently requesting all our allies , including germany , at the nato summit in bucharest in april to match us soldier for soldier , euro for dollar , " nuland wrote in an article in german daily berliner zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from the afghan army and canadian troop patroling in kandahar nuland wrote that nato was confronted with the biggest challenge in its 59-year-old history .
" the mission in afghanistan is an investment in our common security and a catalyst for adapting our democratic alliance to the demands of the 21st century , " she wrote .
" if we are successful in the hindukush , we will be stronger the next time we are called upon to defend our security and values far away from home . "
pressure on europeans set to grow pressure on europeans from the us to shoulder more security burdens on the international stage is expected to grow regardless of whether the next us administration is republican or democratic , experts say .
" whoever wins the elections will have to reduce the financial and economic burdens that have resulted from the us ' foreign and security policy commitments , " said horst teltschik , the munich conference organizer this week .
" we will witness more debate on the future international role of nato and burden-sharing in general and on the responsibility shouldered by the europeans for resolving conflicts in particular . "
" a world in disarray " the annual roundtable in munich 's luxurious bayerischer hof hotel was attended by a handful of presidents , dozens of government ministers and hundreds of security experts from some 50 countries .
the conference 's theme - " a world in disarray - shifting powers lack of strategies " - saw delegates exchange views on a broad variety of issues , such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the widening rift between the west and vladimir putin 's russia .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates has launched a diplomatic drive to persuade europeans to step up support " a few allies in nato should n't have the luxury to decide only for stabilization and civilian operations thereby forcing other allies to bear a disproportionate share of fighting and dying , " gates told a group of high-profile diplomats at a key security conference in the southern german city of munich on sunday , feb 10 .
the us has some 29,000 troops in afghanistan .
" we must not , we can not , become a two-tiered alliance of those who are willing to fight and those who are not , " gates said .
" such a development , with all its implications for collective security , would effectively destroy the alliance , " gates told delegates at the conference .
in recent weeks , gates has pressed berlin and other allies to provide more troops and resources for the nato force in afghanistan gates soothes tensions with germany the pressure has raised problems for the german government caught between maintaining good relations with washington and selling a risky military mission to increasingly sceptical voters at home .
germany , which has confined its 3,200 troops to the safer north of afghanistan where they are largely involved in civil reconstruction , has repeatedly ruled out sending combat troops to the south .
earlier , the pentagon chief attempted to calm tensions with germany , the third largest troop provider in afghanistan , over nato 's afghan mission , saying ties would not suffer if berlin did not provide fresh troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has warned that troops are overstretched in afghanistan " any additional numbers from any country are most appreciated , " gates told reporters at the conference . " maybe some will be able to help .
it certainly will not be seen as negative in our bilateral relations if some are not able to do more . "
some german politicians criticised gates after his speech , with one accusing him of public " finger pointing , " but the pentagon chief said he had not meant to single out specific countries and called germany " a little overly sensitive . "
" this is a problem that the alliance has , not that any individual country has , " gates said .
" the finger was never pointed in germany 's direction . "
germany defends afghan mission chancellor angela merkel defended germany 's engagement in a newspaper interview published on sunday , and confirmed the country would not alter its mission in afghanistan , despite a report in the weekly der spiegel on saturday that said germany was planning to expand the number of soldiers by 1,000 to 4,500 .
" we 've got a strong engagement with our responsibilities in the north , " she told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , adding " it 's not the case that ' nothing is going on there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel defended germany 's involvement in northern afghanistan " we approved a mandate in parliament just a few months ago for the operation and that remains valid until october .
nothing about that will be changed . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too urged the us to be fair in the row over german troops in afghanistan .
" i 'm not surprised that there are debates over individual contributions .
but they must be fair ones , " steinmeier told german news magazine focus .
gates : europe not aware of danger at the same time , gates said at the security conference that europeans seemed unconvinced by the involvement in afghanistan .
" many europeans question the worth of our actions and doubt whether the mission is worth the lives of their sons and daughters , " gates said .
" fragile coalition governments make it difficult to take on this risk . "
the pentagon chief said he was worried that many people in europe had not understood the magnitude of the direct threat to european security .
gates bemoaned the fact that many europeans were questioning the merits of nato 's role in afghanistan and were calling for their troops to be pulled out , arguing that there was a direct link between the fight against the taliban and the broader fight against islamic terrorism .
" with safe havens in the middle east , and new tactics honed on the battlefield and transmitted via the internet , violence and terrorism worldwide could surge , " he said .
the pentagon chief appealed this week to europeans not to let their opposition to the iraq war color their view of the conflict in afghanistan . " i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused and what i want to try and focus on is why afghanistan is important to europe , " gates said on friday .
" i think they -lsb- the europeans -rsb- combine the two , " gates continued .
" many of them , i think , have a problem with our involvement in iraq and project that to afghanistan and do not understand the very different - for them - the very different kind of threat . "
" soldier for soldier , euro for dollar " gates ' push for more european help in afghanistan was echoed by victoria nuland , the us ambassador to nato .
" we will be urgently requesting all our allies , including germany , at the nato summit in bucharest in april to match us soldier for soldier , euro for dollar , " nuland wrote in an article in german daily berliner zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from the afghan army and canadian troop patroling in kandahar nuland wrote that nato was confronted with the biggest challenge in its 59-year-old history .
" the mission in afghanistan is an investment in our common security and a catalyst for adapting our democratic alliance to the demands of the 21st century , " she wrote .
" if we are successful in the hindukush , we will be stronger the next time we are called upon to defend our security and values far away from home . "
pressure on europeans set to grow pressure on europeans from the us to shoulder more security burdens on the international stage is expected to grow regardless of whether the next us administration is republican or democratic , experts say .
" whoever wins the elections will have to reduce the financial and economic burdens that have resulted from the us ' foreign and security policy commitments , " said horst teltschik , the munich conference organizer this week .
" we will witness more debate on the future international role of nato and burden-sharing in general and on the responsibility shouldered by the europeans for resolving conflicts in particular . "
" a world in disarray " the annual roundtable in munich 's luxurious bayerischer hof hotel was attended by a handful of presidents , dozens of government ministers and hundreds of security experts from some 50 countries .
the conference 's theme - " a world in disarray - shifting powers lack of strategies " - saw delegates exchange views on a broad variety of issues , such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the widening rift between the west and vladimir putin 's russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leftwing protestors demonstrated against the conference in munich speakers included turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and mohamed elbaradei , head of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates has launched a diplomatic drive to persuade europeans to step up support " a few allies in nato should n't have the luxury to decide only for stabilization and civilian operations thereby forcing other allies to bear a disproportionate share of fighting and dying , " gates told a group of high-profile diplomats at a key security conference in the southern german city of munich on sunday , feb 10 .
the us has some 29,000 troops in afghanistan .
" we must not , we can not , become a two-tiered alliance of those who are willing to fight and those who are not , " gates said .
" such a development , with all its implications for collective security , would effectively destroy the alliance , " gates told delegates at the conference .
in recent weeks , gates has pressed berlin and other allies to provide more troops and resources for the nato force in afghanistan gates soothes tensions with germany the pressure has raised problems for the german government caught between maintaining good relations with washington and selling a risky military mission to increasingly sceptical voters at home .
germany , which has confined its 3,200 troops to the safer north of afghanistan where they are largely involved in civil reconstruction , has repeatedly ruled out sending combat troops to the south .
earlier , the pentagon chief attempted to calm tensions with germany , the third largest troop provider in afghanistan , over nato 's afghan mission , saying ties would not suffer if berlin did not provide fresh troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has warned that troops are overstretched in afghanistan " any additional numbers from any country are most appreciated , " gates told reporters at the conference . " maybe some will be able to help .
it certainly will not be seen as negative in our bilateral relations if some are not able to do more . "
some german politicians criticised gates after his speech , with one accusing him of public " finger pointing , " but the pentagon chief said he had not meant to single out specific countries and called germany " a little overly sensitive . "
" this is a problem that the alliance has , not that any individual country has , " gates said .
" the finger was never pointed in germany 's direction . "
germany defends afghan mission chancellor angela merkel defended germany 's engagement in a newspaper interview published on sunday , and confirmed the country would not alter its mission in afghanistan , despite a report in the weekly der spiegel on saturday that said germany was planning to expand the number of soldiers by 1,000 to 4,500 .
" we 've got a strong engagement with our responsibilities in the north , " she told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , adding " it 's not the case that ' nothing is going on there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel defended germany 's involvement in northern afghanistan " we approved a mandate in parliament just a few months ago for the operation and that remains valid until october .
nothing about that will be changed . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too urged the us to be fair in the row over german troops in afghanistan .
" i 'm not surprised that there are debates over individual contributions .
but they must be fair ones , " steinmeier told german news magazine focus .
gates : europe not aware of danger at the same time , gates said at the security conference that europeans seemed unconvinced by the involvement in afghanistan .
" many europeans question the worth of our actions and doubt whether the mission is worth the lives of their sons and daughters , " gates said .
" fragile coalition governments make it difficult to take on this risk . "
the pentagon chief said he was worried that many people in europe had not understood the magnitude of the direct threat to european security .
gates bemoaned the fact that many europeans were questioning the merits of nato 's role in afghanistan and were calling for their troops to be pulled out , arguing that there was a direct link between the fight against the taliban and the broader fight against islamic terrorism .
" with safe havens in the middle east , and new tactics honed on the battlefield and transmitted via the internet , violence and terrorism worldwide could surge , " he said .
the pentagon chief appealed this week to europeans not to let their opposition to the iraq war color their view of the conflict in afghanistan . " i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused and what i want to try and focus on is why afghanistan is important to europe , " gates said on friday .
" i think they -lsb- the europeans -rsb- combine the two , " gates continued .
" many of them , i think , have a problem with our involvement in iraq and project that to afghanistan and do not understand the very different - for them - the very different kind of threat . "
" soldier for soldier , euro for dollar " gates ' push for more european help in afghanistan was echoed by victoria nuland , the us ambassador to nato .
" we will be urgently requesting all our allies , including germany , at the nato summit in bucharest in april to match us soldier for soldier , euro for dollar , " nuland wrote in an article in german daily berliner zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from the afghan army and canadian troop patroling in kandahar nuland wrote that nato was confronted with the biggest challenge in its 59-year-old history .
" the mission in afghanistan is an investment in our common security and a catalyst for adapting our democratic alliance to the demands of the 21st century , " she wrote .
" if we are successful in the hindukush , we will be stronger the next time we are called upon to defend our security and values far away from home . "
pressure on europeans set to grow pressure on europeans from the us to shoulder more security burdens on the international stage is expected to grow regardless of whether the next us administration is republican or democratic , experts say .
" whoever wins the elections will have to reduce the financial and economic burdens that have resulted from the us ' foreign and security policy commitments , " said horst teltschik , the munich conference organizer this week .
" we will witness more debate on the future international role of nato and burden-sharing in general and on the responsibility shouldered by the europeans for resolving conflicts in particular . "
" a world in disarray " the annual roundtable in munich 's luxurious bayerischer hof hotel was attended by a handful of presidents , dozens of government ministers and hundreds of security experts from some 50 countries .
the conference 's theme - " a world in disarray - shifting powers lack of strategies " - saw delegates exchange views on a broad variety of issues , such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the widening rift between the west and vladimir putin 's russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leftwing protestors demonstrated against the conference in munich speakers included turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and mohamed elbaradei , head of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .

about two thirds of the initial test subjects participated in the second round of questioning . while less than 15 percent of non-smokers reported having suicidal thoughts , over 30 percent of addicts had considered committing suicide .
the rate for occasional smokers and non-addicted regular smokers was around 20 percent . more research needed none of the test subjects actually took their own life during the study , though almost 70 of them made suicide attempts . " campaigns for reducing smoking should also point to the elevated risk of suicidality for occasional and regular smokers , " wrote the study 's authors in the journal of affective disorders , as reported by dpa news agency . the scientists in charge of the study said that none of the participants had a history of clinical depression or of alcohol or drug abuse .

between 15,000 and 20,000 lobbyists are said to work here for economic and professional bodies .
the german association of fire brigades -lrb- dvf -rrb- recently became the latest group to open an office in brussels .
some people might find this strange .
but decisions from brussels have an enormous impact on the everyday working life of each individual fireman , says dvf spokesman sönke jacobs .
the eu decides which driving license the uniform-clad heroes need , how long they 're allowed to work and what their protective clothing is supposed to look like .
however , it had taken a while for the fire brigade to realize this .
" we only discovered brussels in the past three or four years , " jacobs said .
the german federal states meanwhile have been trying for years to influence eu commission officials and legislators .
each state has its own diplomatic representation , except for the city-state of hamburg and its northern neighbour , schleswig-holstein , who share a building .
others have expanded rapidly in recent years , with the bavarians even residing in their own palace .
lobbyists taking over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians of all 27-member states are ripe for the picking eu institutions and lobbies are taking up 3.5 million square meters of space in brussels , according to the brussels-europe liaison-office .
bernd dittmann is in charge of a representation with offices on seven levels .
having chaired the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- for 10 years , he is a veteran of the brussels scene .
nevertheless , he is surprised every now and then .
" i 'm sometimes amazed about all the pressure groups that exist , " he said , adding that he thinks the number of lobbyists ' offices has grown steadily over the years .
" after washington , brussels is the worlds ' largest lobbyists ' city , " said erik wesselius of the corporate europe observatory .
the amsterdam-based non-governmental organization observes the economic and political power of lobbyists .
huge sums spent on buying influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists reach out to the decision makers in brussels the organization estimates that the lobbyists spend up to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- a year to influence decision-makers in brussels .
but even wesselius does n't know how many representations there actually are in the city .
" we need a mandatory list that can make the influx of money more transparent , " the lobby observer said .
the eu commission is planning to set up a register this summer , even though signing up will be voluntary .
but wesselius thinks little of the idea .
" many lobbyists have already indicated they will not register because they would have to reveal their clients and their income , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about two thirds of the initial test subjects participated in the second round of questioning . while less than 15 percent of non-smokers reported having suicidal thoughts , over 30 percent of addicts had considered committing suicide .
the rate for occasional smokers and non-addicted regular smokers was around 20 percent . more research needed none of the test subjects actually took their own life during the study , though almost 70 of them made suicide attempts . " campaigns for reducing smoking should also point to the elevated risk of suicidality for occasional and regular smokers , " wrote the study 's authors in the journal of affective disorders , as reported by dpa news agency . the scientists in charge of the study said that none of the participants had a history of clinical depression or of alcohol or drug abuse .
they also cautioned that , while a connection had been found , no direct causal link had been established and more research was needed . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 09.02.2008 brussels swelling with lobby groups and associations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists apply pressure on the eu politicians in brussels from the candle-makers ' association to the union of potato-starch factories , to the association of the crinkled-cardboard industry , there 's hardly a pressure group missing from the european union capital . if you want to achieve anything in brussels you need an office in the city .
between 15,000 and 20,000 lobbyists are said to work here for economic and professional bodies .
the german association of fire brigades -lrb- dvf -rrb- recently became the latest group to open an office in brussels .
some people might find this strange .
but decisions from brussels have an enormous impact on the everyday working life of each individual fireman , says dvf spokesman sönke jacobs .
the eu decides which driving license the uniform-clad heroes need , how long they 're allowed to work and what their protective clothing is supposed to look like .
however , it had taken a while for the fire brigade to realize this .
" we only discovered brussels in the past three or four years , " jacobs said .
the german federal states meanwhile have been trying for years to influence eu commission officials and legislators .
each state has its own diplomatic representation , except for the city-state of hamburg and its northern neighbour , schleswig-holstein , who share a building .
others have expanded rapidly in recent years , with the bavarians even residing in their own palace .
lobbyists taking over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians of all 27-member states are ripe for the picking eu institutions and lobbies are taking up 3.5 million square meters of space in brussels , according to the brussels-europe liaison-office .
bernd dittmann is in charge of a representation with offices on seven levels .
having chaired the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- for 10 years , he is a veteran of the brussels scene .
nevertheless , he is surprised every now and then .
" i 'm sometimes amazed about all the pressure groups that exist , " he said , adding that he thinks the number of lobbyists ' offices has grown steadily over the years .
" after washington , brussels is the worlds ' largest lobbyists ' city , " said erik wesselius of the corporate europe observatory .
the amsterdam-based non-governmental organization observes the economic and political power of lobbyists .
huge sums spent on buying influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists reach out to the decision makers in brussels the organization estimates that the lobbyists spend up to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- a year to influence decision-makers in brussels .
but even wesselius does n't know how many representations there actually are in the city .
" we need a mandatory list that can make the influx of money more transparent , " the lobby observer said .
the eu commission is planning to set up a register this summer , even though signing up will be voluntary .
but wesselius thinks little of the idea .
" many lobbyists have already indicated they will not register because they would have to reveal their clients and their income , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : expanded german mission in afghanistan germany rejects us pressure as nato 's afghan rift deepens opinion : despite divide , nato has common goal in afghanistan security -pipe- 09.02.2008 gates presses europeans to back afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan topped the agenda at the munich security conference us defense secretary robert gates said the nato alliance was at risk if it became split between members willing and unwilling to fight as he urged europeans to support the afghan mission with more troops . gates sharply criticized european nato partners for holding back from contributing combat troops to afghanistan where a 43,000-strong nato mission is battling taliban insurgents in the country 's dangerous south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates has launched a diplomatic drive to persuade europeans to step up support " a few allies in nato should n't have the luxury to decide only for stabilization and civilian operations thereby forcing other allies to bear a disproportionate share of fighting and dying , " gates told a group of high-profile diplomats at a key security conference in the southern german city of munich on sunday , feb 10 .
the us has some 29,000 troops in afghanistan .
" we must not , we can not , become a two-tiered alliance of those who are willing to fight and those who are not , " gates said .
" such a development , with all its implications for collective security , would effectively destroy the alliance , " gates told delegates at the conference .
in recent weeks , gates has pressed berlin and other allies to provide more troops and resources for the nato force in afghanistan gates soothes tensions with germany the pressure has raised problems for the german government caught between maintaining good relations with washington and selling a risky military mission to increasingly sceptical voters at home .
germany , which has confined its 3,200 troops to the safer north of afghanistan where they are largely involved in civil reconstruction , has repeatedly ruled out sending combat troops to the south .
earlier , the pentagon chief attempted to calm tensions with germany , the third largest troop provider in afghanistan , over nato 's afghan mission , saying ties would not suffer if berlin did not provide fresh troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has warned that troops are overstretched in afghanistan " any additional numbers from any country are most appreciated , " gates told reporters at the conference . " maybe some will be able to help .
it certainly will not be seen as negative in our bilateral relations if some are not able to do more . "
some german politicians criticised gates after his speech , with one accusing him of public " finger pointing , " but the pentagon chief said he had not meant to single out specific countries and called germany " a little overly sensitive . "
" this is a problem that the alliance has , not that any individual country has , " gates said .
" the finger was never pointed in germany 's direction . "
germany defends afghan mission chancellor angela merkel defended germany 's engagement in a newspaper interview published on sunday , and confirmed the country would not alter its mission in afghanistan , despite a report in the weekly der spiegel on saturday that said germany was planning to expand the number of soldiers by 1,000 to 4,500 .
" we 've got a strong engagement with our responsibilities in the north , " she told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , adding " it 's not the case that ' nothing is going on there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel defended germany 's involvement in northern afghanistan " we approved a mandate in parliament just a few months ago for the operation and that remains valid until october .
nothing about that will be changed . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too urged the us to be fair in the row over german troops in afghanistan .
" i 'm not surprised that there are debates over individual contributions .
but they must be fair ones , " steinmeier told german news magazine focus .
gates : europe not aware of danger at the same time , gates said at the security conference that europeans seemed unconvinced by the involvement in afghanistan .
" many europeans question the worth of our actions and doubt whether the mission is worth the lives of their sons and daughters , " gates said .
" fragile coalition governments make it difficult to take on this risk . "
the pentagon chief said he was worried that many people in europe had not understood the magnitude of the direct threat to european security .
gates bemoaned the fact that many europeans were questioning the merits of nato 's role in afghanistan and were calling for their troops to be pulled out , arguing that there was a direct link between the fight against the taliban and the broader fight against islamic terrorism .
" with safe havens in the middle east , and new tactics honed on the battlefield and transmitted via the internet , violence and terrorism worldwide could surge , " he said .
the pentagon chief appealed this week to europeans not to let their opposition to the iraq war color their view of the conflict in afghanistan . " i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused and what i want to try and focus on is why afghanistan is important to europe , " gates said on friday .
" i think they -lsb- the europeans -rsb- combine the two , " gates continued .
" many of them , i think , have a problem with our involvement in iraq and project that to afghanistan and do not understand the very different - for them - the very different kind of threat . "
" soldier for soldier , euro for dollar " gates ' push for more european help in afghanistan was echoed by victoria nuland , the us ambassador to nato .
" we will be urgently requesting all our allies , including germany , at the nato summit in bucharest in april to match us soldier for soldier , euro for dollar , " nuland wrote in an article in german daily berliner zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from the afghan army and canadian troop patroling in kandahar nuland wrote that nato was confronted with the biggest challenge in its 59-year-old history .
" the mission in afghanistan is an investment in our common security and a catalyst for adapting our democratic alliance to the demands of the 21st century , " she wrote .
" if we are successful in the hindukush , we will be stronger the next time we are called upon to defend our security and values far away from home . "
pressure on europeans set to grow pressure on europeans from the us to shoulder more security burdens on the international stage is expected to grow regardless of whether the next us administration is republican or democratic , experts say .
" whoever wins the elections will have to reduce the financial and economic burdens that have resulted from the us ' foreign and security policy commitments , " said horst teltschik , the munich conference organizer this week .
" we will witness more debate on the future international role of nato and burden-sharing in general and on the responsibility shouldered by the europeans for resolving conflicts in particular . "
" a world in disarray " the annual roundtable in munich 's luxurious bayerischer hof hotel was attended by a handful of presidents , dozens of government ministers and hundreds of security experts from some 50 countries .
the conference 's theme - " a world in disarray - shifting powers lack of strategies " - saw delegates exchange views on a broad variety of issues , such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the widening rift between the west and vladimir putin 's russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leftwing protestors demonstrated against the conference in munich speakers included turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and mohamed elbaradei , head of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates has launched a diplomatic drive to persuade europeans to step up support " a few allies in nato should n't have the luxury to decide only for stabilization and civilian operations thereby forcing other allies to bear a disproportionate share of fighting and dying , " gates told a group of high-profile diplomats at a key security conference in the southern german city of munich on sunday , feb 10 .
the us has some 29,000 troops in afghanistan .
" we must not , we can not , become a two-tiered alliance of those who are willing to fight and those who are not , " gates said .
" such a development , with all its implications for collective security , would effectively destroy the alliance , " gates told delegates at the conference .
in recent weeks , gates has pressed berlin and other allies to provide more troops and resources for the nato force in afghanistan gates soothes tensions with germany the pressure has raised problems for the german government caught between maintaining good relations with washington and selling a risky military mission to increasingly sceptical voters at home .
germany , which has confined its 3,200 troops to the safer north of afghanistan where they are largely involved in civil reconstruction , has repeatedly ruled out sending combat troops to the south .
earlier , the pentagon chief attempted to calm tensions with germany , the third largest troop provider in afghanistan , over nato 's afghan mission , saying ties would not suffer if berlin did not provide fresh troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has warned that troops are overstretched in afghanistan " any additional numbers from any country are most appreciated , " gates told reporters at the conference . " maybe some will be able to help .
it certainly will not be seen as negative in our bilateral relations if some are not able to do more . "
some german politicians criticised gates after his speech , with one accusing him of public " finger pointing , " but the pentagon chief said he had not meant to single out specific countries and called germany " a little overly sensitive . "
" this is a problem that the alliance has , not that any individual country has , " gates said .
" the finger was never pointed in germany 's direction . "
germany defends afghan mission chancellor angela merkel defended germany 's engagement in a newspaper interview published on sunday , and confirmed the country would not alter its mission in afghanistan , despite a report in the weekly der spiegel on saturday that said germany was planning to expand the number of soldiers by 1,000 to 4,500 .
" we 've got a strong engagement with our responsibilities in the north , " she told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , adding " it 's not the case that ' nothing is going on there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel defended germany 's involvement in northern afghanistan " we approved a mandate in parliament just a few months ago for the operation and that remains valid until october .
nothing about that will be changed . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too urged the us to be fair in the row over german troops in afghanistan .
" i 'm not surprised that there are debates over individual contributions .
but they must be fair ones , " steinmeier told german news magazine focus .
gates : europe not aware of danger at the same time , gates said at the security conference that europeans seemed unconvinced by the involvement in afghanistan .
" many europeans question the worth of our actions and doubt whether the mission is worth the lives of their sons and daughters , " gates said .
" fragile coalition governments make it difficult to take on this risk . "
the pentagon chief said he was worried that many people in europe had not understood the magnitude of the direct threat to european security .
gates bemoaned the fact that many europeans were questioning the merits of nato 's role in afghanistan and were calling for their troops to be pulled out , arguing that there was a direct link between the fight against the taliban and the broader fight against islamic terrorism .
" with safe havens in the middle east , and new tactics honed on the battlefield and transmitted via the internet , violence and terrorism worldwide could surge , " he said .
the pentagon chief appealed this week to europeans not to let their opposition to the iraq war color their view of the conflict in afghanistan . " i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused and what i want to try and focus on is why afghanistan is important to europe , " gates said on friday .
" i think they -lsb- the europeans -rsb- combine the two , " gates continued .
" many of them , i think , have a problem with our involvement in iraq and project that to afghanistan and do not understand the very different - for them - the very different kind of threat . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates has launched a diplomatic drive to persuade europeans to step up support " a few allies in nato should n't have the luxury to decide only for stabilization and civilian operations thereby forcing other allies to bear a disproportionate share of fighting and dying , " gates told a group of high-profile diplomats at a key security conference in the southern german city of munich on sunday , feb 10 .
the us has some 29,000 troops in afghanistan .
" we must not , we can not , become a two-tiered alliance of those who are willing to fight and those who are not , " gates said .
" such a development , with all its implications for collective security , would effectively destroy the alliance , " gates told delegates at the conference .
in recent weeks , gates has pressed berlin and other allies to provide more troops and resources for the nato force in afghanistan gates soothes tensions with germany the pressure has raised problems for the german government caught between maintaining good relations with washington and selling a risky military mission to increasingly sceptical voters at home .
germany , which has confined its 3,200 troops to the safer north of afghanistan where they are largely involved in civil reconstruction , has repeatedly ruled out sending combat troops to the south .
earlier , the pentagon chief attempted to calm tensions with germany , the third largest troop provider in afghanistan , over nato 's afghan mission , saying ties would not suffer if berlin did not provide fresh troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has warned that troops are overstretched in afghanistan " any additional numbers from any country are most appreciated , " gates told reporters at the conference . " maybe some will be able to help .
it certainly will not be seen as negative in our bilateral relations if some are not able to do more . "
some german politicians criticised gates after his speech , with one accusing him of public " finger pointing , " but the pentagon chief said he had not meant to single out specific countries and called germany " a little overly sensitive . "
" this is a problem that the alliance has , not that any individual country has , " gates said .
" the finger was never pointed in germany 's direction . "
germany defends afghan mission chancellor angela merkel defended germany 's engagement in a newspaper interview published on sunday , and confirmed the country would not alter its mission in afghanistan , despite a report in the weekly der spiegel on saturday that said germany was planning to expand the number of soldiers by 1,000 to 4,500 .
" we 've got a strong engagement with our responsibilities in the north , " she told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , adding " it 's not the case that ' nothing is going on there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel defended germany 's involvement in northern afghanistan " we approved a mandate in parliament just a few months ago for the operation and that remains valid until october .
nothing about that will be changed . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too urged the us to be fair in the row over german troops in afghanistan .
" i 'm not surprised that there are debates over individual contributions .
but they must be fair ones , " steinmeier told german news magazine focus .
gates : europe not aware of danger at the same time , gates said at the security conference that europeans seemed unconvinced by the involvement in afghanistan .
" many europeans question the worth of our actions and doubt whether the mission is worth the lives of their sons and daughters , " gates said .
" fragile coalition governments make it difficult to take on this risk . "
the pentagon chief said he was worried that many people in europe had not understood the magnitude of the direct threat to european security .
gates bemoaned the fact that many europeans were questioning the merits of nato 's role in afghanistan and were calling for their troops to be pulled out , arguing that there was a direct link between the fight against the taliban and the broader fight against islamic terrorism .
" with safe havens in the middle east , and new tactics honed on the battlefield and transmitted via the internet , violence and terrorism worldwide could surge , " he said .
the pentagon chief appealed this week to europeans not to let their opposition to the iraq war color their view of the conflict in afghanistan . " i worry that for many europeans the missions in iraq and afghanistan are confused and what i want to try and focus on is why afghanistan is important to europe , " gates said on friday .
" i think they -lsb- the europeans -rsb- combine the two , " gates continued .
" many of them , i think , have a problem with our involvement in iraq and project that to afghanistan and do not understand the very different - for them - the very different kind of threat . "
" soldier for soldier , euro for dollar " gates ' push for more european help in afghanistan was echoed by victoria nuland , the us ambassador to nato .
" we will be urgently requesting all our allies , including germany , at the nato summit in bucharest in april to match us soldier for soldier , euro for dollar , " nuland wrote in an article in german daily berliner zeitung .

about two thirds of the initial test subjects participated in the second round of questioning . while less than 15 percent of non-smokers reported having suicidal thoughts , over 30 percent of addicts had considered committing suicide .
the rate for occasional smokers and non-addicted regular smokers was around 20 percent . more research needed none of the test subjects actually took their own life during the study , though almost 70 of them made suicide attempts . " campaigns for reducing smoking should also point to the elevated risk of suicidality for occasional and regular smokers , " wrote the study 's authors in the journal of affective disorders , as reported by dpa news agency . the scientists in charge of the study said that none of the participants had a history of clinical depression or of alcohol or drug abuse .

by brian meechan bbc news in the world of politics , when a leader announces when he 's standing down , attention quickly turns to who 'll replace him .
rhodri morgan is celebrating eight years at the helm of the assembly government .
he 'll be forgiven for reflecting on his achievements and considering his legacy .
but on friday , he told us that he plans to stand down as first minister on or around his 70th birthday on 29 september , 2009 .
ambition is in the dna of most politicians and there will be many labour assembly members with an eye on the prize of leading their party and the nation as well .
but some senior cabinet figures have already ruled themselves out .
health minister edwina hart and environment minister jane davidson are experienced hands who 've been seen as credible candidates for the job .
both have said they wo n't stand .
welsh labour has prided itself on having more women assembly members than men .
it 's one of the reasons why the welsh assembly had an equal gender balance - one of the few institutions in the world that had - though that 's no longer the case .
but for a party that celebrated its role in bringing gender balance to cardiff bay politics , the runners and riders more usually talked about for the leadership are an exclusively male group .
the counsel general , who 's the chief legal adviser to the assembly government , carwyn jones is - some say - the heir apparent .
he was agriculture minister at the time of the foot- and-mouth outbreak in wales and he 's considered a safe pair of hands and a good communicator .
finance minister andrew davies is responsible for public service delivery .
he 's seen by some as more managerial in style than his colleagues and as someone able to get the job done .
deputy minister for regeneration leighton andrews became an assembly member in 2003 , unlike carwyn jones and andrew davies , who 've been ministers since 1999 .
but he 's seen as a strong campaigner .
he may be less likely to run if andrew davies is a candidate because they previously worked together in business and could appeal to the same constituency .
merthyr tydfil am huw lewis , was the former deputy social justice minister .
he spoke out against labour 's coalition deal with plaid cymru and was subsequently left out of the government when the parties formed a coalition in the assembly .
he may appeal to the section of labour 's rank and file who are unhappy with that deal , if he can get the six nominations from assembly members that are needed to get on the ballot .
as the cliché goes , a week 's a long time in politics , which means there 's an awful lot that can happen in the next 18 months .
we can expect plenty of positioning and even more speculation before september 2009 .

by brian meechan bbc news rhodri morgan will stand down when he reaches 70 in the world of politics , when a leader announces when he 's standing down , attention quickly turns to who 'll replace him .
rhodri morgan is celebrating eight years at the helm of the assembly government .
he 'll be forgiven for reflecting on his achievements and considering his legacy .
but on friday , he told us that he plans to stand down as first minister on or around his 70th birthday on 29 september , 2009 .
ambition is in the dna of most politicians and there will be many labour assembly members with an eye on the prize of leading their party and the nation as well .
but some senior cabinet figures have already ruled themselves out .
health minister edwina hart and environment minister jane davidson are experienced hands who 've been seen as credible candidates for the job .
both have said they wo n't stand .
carwyn jones is the heir apparent , according to some political watchers welsh labour has prided itself on having more women assembly members than men .
it 's one of the reasons why the welsh assembly had an equal gender balance - one of the few institutions in the world that had - though that 's no longer the case .
but for a party that celebrated its role in bringing gender balance to cardiff bay politics , the runners and riders more usually talked about for the leadership are an exclusively male group .
the counsel general , who 's the chief legal adviser to the assembly government , carwyn jones is - some say - the heir apparent .
he was agriculture minister at the time of the foot- and-mouth outbreak in wales and he 's considered a safe pair of hands and a good communicator .
finance minister andrew davies is responsible for public service delivery .
he 's seen by some as more managerial in style than his colleagues and as someone able to get the job done .
leighton andrews is seen as a strong campaigner deputy minister for regeneration leighton andrews became an assembly member in 2003 , unlike carwyn jones and andrew davies , who 've been ministers since 1999 .
but he 's seen as a strong campaigner .
he may be less likely to run if andrew davies is a candidate because they previously worked together in business and could appeal to the same constituency .
merthyr tydfil am huw lewis , was the former deputy social justice minister .
he spoke out against labour 's coalition deal with plaid cymru and was subsequently left out of the government when the parties formed a coalition in the assembly .
he may appeal to the section of labour 's rank and file who are unhappy with that deal , if he can get the six nominations from assembly members that are needed to get on the ballot .
as the cliché goes , a week 's a long time in politics , which means there 's an awful lot that can happen in the next 18 months .
we can expect plenty of positioning and even more speculation before september 2009 .

network rail says 2,000 bridges are hit every year by lorries travelling on inappropriate roads .
the resulting disruption is said to cost the rail industry £ 10m a year and causes 5,000 hours of delays .
network rail is appealing to drivers to pay attention to road signs warning them of hazards ahead .
bridge map pj taylor , from network rail , said in the last few years the number of vehicles hitting bridges had increased sharply .
" sat-navs are a great tool but they are not an alternative for keeping your wits about you and obeying the rules of the road , " he told bbc radio five live .
talks were under way with satellite navigation companies about how the problem could be resolved , he said .
in the meantime , network rail said it was working on a project to map the uk 's low bridges and level crossings so that information could be fed into sat-nav software .
the shortcomings of sat-nav systems have been widely reported , from lorries getting stuck in narrow country lanes , to out-of-date sat-nav systems directing fans and players to swansea 's old football ground , and even a coachload of shoppers ending up in the wrong country .
paula ceely 's car was hit by a train car drivers have also landed themselves in difficulties for slavishly following their in-car technology .
paula ceely narrowly escaped injury last may when she followed her sat-nav system onto a railway track at ffynongain in south wales .
the 20-year-old student was on her way to see her boyfriend when she tried to cross the line in the dark .
she heard a train horn and realised the vehicle was on the track moments before the train smashed into her car .
and last month in suffolk a takeaway delivery driver , who had misunderstood his sat-nav directions , drove onto a railway line .
instead of turning into a small road , the foreign student drove onto the line and became stuck between a cattle grid and the track .
trains were held up for an hour as he and his passenger tried to push the car off the line .

but the group pledged to act individually and together to promote stability and growth .
it also urged banks to disclose all their losses and bolster their balance sheets to help stabilise markets .
the group 's statement came after a day-long meeting of ministers and central bank governors in tokyo .
" in all our economies , to varying degrees , growth is expected to slow somewhat in the short term , " it said .
as financial officials , we need to respond resolutely and proactively to the turmoil hank paulson us treasury secretary the g7 nations said that continuing risks included further problems for the us housing market , tighter credit , high commodity prices and rising inflation .
" going forward , we will continue to watch developments closely and continue to take appropriate actions , individually and collectively , in order to secure stability and growth in our economies , " they said .
they also called on oil producers to increase output and on china to let its currency appreciate faster .
us woes us treasury secretary hank paulson said current financial turmoil was " serious and persisting " .
" as the financial markets recover from this period of stress , as of course they will , we should expect continued volatility as risk is repriced , " he said .
" as financial officials , we need to respond resolutely and proactively to the turmoil . "
he did not suggest specific measures for g7 partners to take .
mr paulson said he was confident in the long-term health of the us economy and expected it to grow this year , but also said a recent stimulus package had been crucial .
global trends the g7 countries include the us , japan , the uk , canada , france , germany and italy , all of which are experiencing a significant slowdown in growth .
g7 members hope the tokyo meeting will calm global credit fears meanwhile , china , india and other east and south east asian economies have experienced break-neck growth over the past few years as current account surpluses and foreign exchange reserves have ballooned .
but as the global credit crisis and us housing slump has brought the world 's largest economy to its knees , concerns have persisted that these problems would spread to asia , which is heavily reliant on us imports of its products and foreign investment for growth .
on friday , haruhiko kuroda , the head of the asian development bank , warned that the us economic downturn would take its toll on emerging asian economies .
but he stressed that rising inflation in the region is currently more of a threat than worries about a slowdown .
more rate cuts ?
last week , the international monetary fund cut its global economic growth forecast from 4.4 % to 4.1 % , the lowest in five years .
following aggressive interest rate cuts in the us and the approval of a bill giving americans tax rebates worth $ 167bn -lrb- £ 86bn -rrb- , the focus has been on whether other industrialised nations would implement stimulus plans of their own .
perceptions have changed as to whether the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is likely to reduce interest rates from their current level of 4 % to help boost growth in the euro zone .
ecb president jean-claude trichet has previously maintained a tough line on controlling inflation in the 15-nation bloc that uses the euro despite clear signs that a frail recovery was running out of steam .
but following an ecb decision to keep rates on hold on thursday , he appeared to shift focus , stressing the risks to the global economy in his press conference .
this raised hopes that euro zone interest rates could be cut later this year .

he did not suggest specific measures for g7 partners to take .
mr paulson said he was confident in the long-term health of the us economy and expected it to grow this year , but also said a recent stimulus package had been crucial .
global trends the g7 countries include the us , japan , the uk , canada , france , germany and italy , all of which are experiencing a significant slowdown in growth .
g7 members hope the tokyo meeting will calm global credit fears meanwhile , china , india and other east and south east asian economies have experienced break-neck growth over the past few years as current account surpluses and foreign exchange reserves have ballooned .
but as the global credit crisis and us housing slump has brought the world 's largest economy to its knees , concerns have persisted that these problems would spread to asia , which is heavily reliant on us imports of its products and foreign investment for growth .
on friday , haruhiko kuroda , the head of the asian development bank , warned that the us economic downturn would take its toll on emerging asian economies .
but he stressed that rising inflation in the region is currently more of a threat than worries about a slowdown .
more rate cuts ?
last week , the international monetary fund cut its global economic growth forecast from 4.4 % to 4.1 % , the lowest in five years .
following aggressive interest rate cuts in the us and the approval of a bill giving americans tax rebates worth $ 167bn -lrb- £ 86bn -rrb- , the focus has been on whether other industrialised nations would implement stimulus plans of their own .
perceptions have changed as to whether the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is likely to reduce interest rates from their current level of 4 % to help boost growth in the euro zone .
ecb president jean-claude trichet has previously maintained a tough line on controlling inflation in the 15-nation bloc that uses the euro despite clear signs that a frail recovery was running out of steam .
but following an ecb decision to keep rates on hold on thursday , he appeared to shift focus , stressing the risks to the global economy in his press conference .
this raised hopes that euro zone interest rates could be cut later this year .
